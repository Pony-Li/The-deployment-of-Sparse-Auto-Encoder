  "latent_37": "Cities are increasingly moving ahead of countries in setting carbon-reduction goals and initiatives, according to a new report from banking giant HSBC.\n\nMore than 2,500 cities have now listed climate-change pledges on the Non-State Actor Zone for Climate Action (NAZCA) portal launched as part of the 2014 Lima-Paris Action Agenda, HSBC notes.\n\n“We think this is extremely important because NSAs [non-state actors] can move quicker in implementing climate change policies and measures,” reads the report.\n\nCities and other NSAs tend to be faster than countries at making decisions, and are more accountable to their local electorates. They may also have greater control over which budgets can be assigned to climate-change mitigation policies. (Some experts, however, warn that cities are having serious problems implementing their own climate goals.)\n\nMetropolitan centers have much to lose from inaction. Cities account for up to 70 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, and many are already experiencing major levels of pollution. This causes 3 million deaths a year, according to the World Health Organization.\n\nDangerous levels of airborne particulate matter are a common feature of emerging market cities such as Gwalior or Allahabad in India, or Riyadh in Saudi Arabia. But they are also found in major financial centers such as Paris, London or Stuttgart.\n\nDealing with air pollution is a pressing problem, but one that may pale compared to the looming risks associated with global warming.\n\nWith many major cities in coastal areas, 71 percent of the world’s population might be exposed to rising sea levels by 2025. In Latin America, the proportion of the population living in low-elevation coastal zones could be as high as 90 percent.\n\nCity populations will also be more prone to higher urban temperatures, vector-borne diseases and allergen levels, HSBC predicts.\n\nHealth aside, the investment bank cites OECD data showing that by 2070 up to $35 trillion in assets could be at risk from coastal flooding in large cities.\n\nGiven the magnitude of these threats, it is not surprising that many cities have opted to take climate-change mitigation measures into their own hands.\n\nThe Paris Agreement prompted a 70 percent increase in the number of cities disclosing climate data, with urban centers such as Copenhagen, Melbourne and Stockholm announcing plans to become completely carbon neutral.\n\n“In the U.S., where President Trump has signed an executive order to pull out of the Paris Agreement, it is encouraging from a climate standpoint that 93 cities have pledged commitments to climate action through the NAZCA portal,” reads the report.\n\nIt lists 28 countries that now have 10 or more \"climate-smart cities\" with city-level climate pledges. Europe leads the trend, with 646 cities lining up to cut emissions in Italy alone.\n\nElsewhere, there are significant climate-smart city movements in nations from Mexico to Japan. One country that stands out, HSBC says, is Canada. There, 21 cities have made climate pledges.\n\nCanada’s 10 largest cities account for around half of the country’s population and are on a path to achieve a 40 percent emissions reduction by 2030, on average. This would achieve 17.2 percent of Canada’s national target of a 30 reduction by 2030, according to HSBC.\n\nJonathan Walters, a former World Bank director who now works as an independent economic consultant on energy and climate finance, said the incentives for cities to deal with climate-change mitigation are very strongly linked to local pollution and economic growth factors.\n\n“If you look at China, large city administrations have a very strong incentive to tackle climate-change mitigation because the things you need to do are ones they want to do for other reasons,” he said. “A lot of people are dying from coal pollution, so if you replace coal, you save people from dying and save the planet at the same time.”\n\nIn addition, cities are often able to wield significant power over local transport, which the United Nations Human Settlements Program says accounts for 23 percent of city greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nThus, city planners can help speed up the implementation of electric vehicles and possibly even self-driving vehicle programs, unlocking “enormous gains in energy efficiency of transport,” Walters said. “It changes things dramatically.”",
  "latent_110": "Intro\n\nThis evaluation is the second part of our ongoing Pascal TITAN X series. We have expanded our original article from Wednesday to include all 25 games of our benchmark suite, and we have added a new 3440×1440 WQHD resolution to our standard 3840×2160 and 2560×1440 benching resolutions. We have dropped 1920×1080 as it is meaningless for such powerful cards as the GTX 1080 and the TITAN X because 1080P is hopelessly bottlenecked by even a Core i7 6700K at 4.4GHz.\n\nThe TITAN X is Nvidia’s fourth GeForce GPU based on 16nm Pascal architecture. It is much faster than the GTX 1080 – formerly the world’s fastest video card until last week. It is also considerably more expensive compared with the GTX 1080 which launched at $699 for the reference Founders Edition. The TITAN X is premium-priced starting at $1200 and it is only available directly from Nvidia. Besides being the world’s fastest video card, TITAN X is a hybrid card that is also useful for Single Precision (SP) and Deep Learning compute programs.\n\nLast week, we received a TITAN X for evaluation from Nvidia together with a 3440×1440 ACER Predator X34 (2K/21:9) G-SYNC display last week. The Predator X34 is truly an amazing 34″ display which we shall evaluate later, and it is an excellent match for the TITAN X. As you can see, the Predator’s curved 21:9 screen dwarfs our 28″ 3440×2160 16:9 4K display. 2K super-widescreen WQHD displays are rightly becoming popular and we are going to bench top gaming video cards regularly at this resolution instead of at 1920×1080.\n\nPart 3 of our TITAN X mini-series will be posted mid-week and it will also use our entire 25 game benchmark suite to compare the new Pascal TITAN X with the Maxwell TITAN X to see how much progress has been made, and Part 4 will be devoted to overclocking the TITAN X. Finally, our last segment will be devoted to Compute and to Deep Learning TITAN X benchmarks.\n\nInstead of repeating all of the same information in our GTX 1080 launch review or in last week’s TITAN X introduction, we are going to highlight the differences between the GTX 1080 and the TITAN X. The Titan X is based on GP102 whereas the GTX 1080 is based on GP104. The Titan X has a total of 3584 CUDA cores and it comes equipped with 12GB of GDDR5X whereas the GTX 1080 has 8GB of GDDR5X and 2580 CUDA cores. The TITAN X also features Peak Single Precision performance – 11 TFLOPs FP32 (32-bit floating point) and also has a new instruction set for deep learning inference, 44 TOPS INT8. It features 12GB of memory for scientific applications and also for extreme resolutions in gaming.\n\nHowever, the TITAN X is still a gaming card, and it supports all of the same new features that Nvidia’s Pascal architecture brings. Pascal delivers high clock speeds while using relatively little power – the GeForce TITAN X runs over 1.5 GHz with a TDP of 250W. Pascal’s 16nm manufacturing process allows the TITAN X to perform faster than Maxwell generation GPUs giving it a huge performance lead over the older TITAN X.\n\nOur testing platform is Windows 10 Home 64-bit, using an Intel Core i7-6700K at 4.00GHz which turbos to 4.4GHz for all cores as set in the ASRock Z7170 motherboard’s BIOS, and 16GB of G.SKILL DDR4 at 3000MHz. The settings and hardware are identical except for the cards being tested. Today, we are featuring all 25 games of our benchmark suite, and we are also including four DX12 games – Ashes of the Singularity, Hitman, Rise of the Tomb Raider, and Total War Warhammer – plus Futuremark’s recently released DX12 benchmark, Time Spy.\n\nSpecifications\n\nHere are the specifications for the GTX 1080:\n\nHere are the full specifications for the TITAN X:\n\nHow does the TITAN X compare with the GTX 1080?\n\nFrom the specifications alone, we see that the TITAN X is considerably faster than the GTX 1080. To confirm this and to show how much faster, we are going to look at 25 games to compare the performance of the GTX 1080 with the TITAN X. We are also adding a new feature to BTR’s reviews – percentages of difference between the two video cards. We will explain how we calculate our percentages in the “Test Configuration”.\n\nWe are going to concentrate on the two fastest single-GPU cards in the world, the TITAN X and the GTX 1080. AMD’s flagship, the Fury X, is slower than the GTX 1080 and in our ongoing tests, it has failed to win a single benchmark. The TITAN X will be in a class even higher than the GTX 1080 which easily beat AMD’s fastest card. AMD is pinning their hopes on next year’s big chip, Vega.\n\nLet’s check out the test configuration.\n\nTest Configuration – Hardware\n\nIntel Core i7-6700K (reference 4.0GHz, HyperThreading and Turbo boost is on to 4.4GHz; DX11 CPU graphics).\n\nASRock Z7170M OC Formula motherboard (Intel Z7170 chipset, latest BIOS, PCIe 3.0/3.1 specification, CrossFire/SLI 8x+8x)\n\nG.Skill Ripjaws V 16GB DDR4 (2x8GB, dual channel at 3000MHz)\n\nGTX 1080 8GB , Founders Edition , stock clocks, supplied by Nvidia\n\n, , stock clocks, supplied by Nvidia TITAN X (Pascal), 12GB, stock clocks, supplied by Nvidia\n\nstock clocks, supplied by Nvidia 2TB Toshiba 7200 rpm HDD\n\nEVGA 1000G 1000W power supply unit\n\nThermaltake Water2.0, supplied by Thermaltake\n\nOnboard Realtek Audio\n\nGenius SP-D150 speakers, supplied by Genius\n\nThermaltake Overseer RX-I full tower case, supplied by Thermaltake\n\nASUS 12X Blu-ray writer\n\nMonoprice Crystal Pro 4K (3840×2160)\n\nACER Predator X34 – 34″ WQHD 2K G-SYNC display (3440×1440), supplied by Nvidia\n\nTest Configuration – Software\n\nNvidia’s GeForce 368.98 (TITAN X launch drivers) were used for both Nvidia cards.

One is the “Percentage Difference” that we are using to compare the GTX 1080 versus the TITAN X, and the other is “Percentage Change” which we shall use mid-week to show the improvements of the Pascal TITAN X over the Maxwell TITAN X.\n\nFor the percentage difference we are simply dividing the difference between two numbers by the average of the two numbers. This is usually expressed algebraically where “V” equals value: ( | V 1 – V 2 | / ((V 1 + V 2 )/2) ) * 100\n\nWe also made a BTR community forum post that explains the process of calculating percentage differences using frame rates as an example.\n\nLet’s check out our Performance Summary chart followed by our conclusion.\n\nPerformance summary chart Here are the summary charts of 25 games and 2 synthetic tests. The highest settings are always chosen and it is usually DX11; DX12 is picked above DX11 where available, and the settings are ultra or maxed. Specific settings are listed on the performance charts. The benches were run at 2560×1440, 3840×1440, and at 3840×2160. All results, except for FireStrike and Time Spy, show average framerates and higher is always better. Minimum frame rates are shown next to the averages when they are available, but they are in italics and in a slightly smaller font. In-game settings are fully maxed out and they are identically high or ultra across all platforms. The GTX 1080 performance results are in the first column (in white) and the TITAN X results are shown in the second column (in black). The 3rd column shows the percentage differences between the two video cards. The TITAN X wins every game benchmark by a significant margin of at least 19% at 4K over the world’s second fastest card, the GTX 1080. Generally the difference is at least 20% to 30% and more! The only outliers are at 2560×1440 when the GPU is bottlenecked at that resolution by the CPU with both cards, but especially with the TITAN X. To run at 1920×1080 would be a waste of performance for the TITAN X. UPDATED 08/09/16. Check out Tech of Tomorrow‘s video using our benchmarks! Let’s head for our conclusion. Conclusion This has been quite an enjoyable exploration for us in evaluating the new Pascal TITAN X. It did extraordinarily well performance-wise comparing it to the GTX 1080 in 25 games, and we look forward to running our benchmark suite again in Part 3 versus the Maxwell TITAN X. We are totally impressed with this top performing 6-pin plus 8-pin PCIe cabled Pascal TITAN X chip. Priced at $1200, it is certainly expensive but it stands alone as the world’s fastest gaming GPU. On top of that, it is a hybrid card well suited for Single Precision Compute and for scientific applications. The TITAN X is an ideal card for 4K and it may well be the first video card to be able to handle maxed out settings at that extreme resolution. There are only a couple of games at 4K where settings might have to be dialed back a bit for a fluid gaming experience, and a G-SYNC display is the perfect compliment to the TITAN X. The Verdict: If you want the fastest video card available today, the TITAN X at $1200 is in a class completely by itself, easily topping the performance of the GTX 1080 which was the fastest card until last week at $699. However, you may have to wait awhile as the TITAN X is sold out at Nvidia’s store. Stay tuned, there is a lot coming from us at BTR. Next, in our continuing TITAN X series, we will test the TITAN X with our full benchmark suite versus the Maxwell Titan X by mid-week, and we will show the percentage of increase over the older card.

  "latent_425": "Now, with the presidential race heating up, it is more crucial than ever for voters to know that in fact most of them support Sanders' signature issue. Just look at this summer's polls, as with the New York Times surveys reporting that 57 percent of respondents want the government to do more to reduce the gap between the rich and the poor, while a whopping 84 percent percent think that money has too much influence in political campaigns.\n\nEven those who cheer Trump's seemingly racist immigration-restriction rhetoric often add that they support him because, as a billionaire, he is not beholden to wealthy donors. All of this of course echoes the populism of the first Gilded Age, a mass movement that also contained elements of the right as well as the left -- but, then too, with the general public mostly supporting the latter's efforts to limit the growing concentration of wealth and political power. The successful campaigns for constitutional amendments establishing graduated income tax and the direct election of senators are echoed today in such initiatives as the push for an amendment to overturn the Supreme Court rulings that have facilitated the outsize influence on our electoral system of big donors.\n\nMeantime the major media outlets tend to focus on Sanders' identity as a democratic socialist, as with a recent New York Times Magazine interview that harped on that theme to the exclusion of policy questions. Sanders' political label does not, however, explain these journalists ignoring the widespread popularity of his message, for public officials with no such tag -- e.g. Elizabeth Warren -- find their own critiques of economic inequality similarly mischaracterized as located on the left side of the political spectrum.",

Não podia assumir funções em pior situação, com o clube afundado na tabela classificativa, cravejado de dívidas, cercado pela banca e condenado a ir vendendo passes de jogadores a fundos de investimento ou transferindo-os mesmo, em desespero de causa, para honrar o pagamento de despesas correntes.\n\nHavia que negociar de imediato com a banca, travar a saída de alguns dos melhores jogadores (a de Rui Patrício, por exemplo, fora antecipada diversas vezes nas manchetes dos jornais e nos palpites dos comentadores televisivos).

  "latent_610": "After losing out in the first round of the minor-pro, ECHL playoffs with the Orlando Solar Bears last season, Brett Findlay wasn’t sure what the future had in store for him.\n\nThe Echo Bay, Ontario product had spent the first 15 games of the 2014-2015 season with the Toronto Marlies of the American Hockey League, putting up one goal and three assists, before spending the rest of the campaign with the Solar Bears.\n\nHe thrived in the top-line, forward role he was given in the ECHL and clicked at a near point-per-game pace as he put up 41 points in 45 games in Orlando. Still, Findlay spent a large portion of the off-season waiting for a new contract.\n\n“I think it was around early July when my agent phoned me and said that the Marlies were interested in re-signing me for another season,” said Findlay, who prior to turning pro, skated in the Northern Ontario Jr. Hockey League with the Blind River Beavers and as an undrafted walk-on in the Ontario Hockey League with the Soo Greyhounds and Peterborough Petes.\n\n“So, that was nice to kind of get it over with and really try and focus on myself and the off-season training,” he recalled.\n\nStill, Findlay began the 2015-2016 season with the Solar Bears in the ECHL but instead of hanging his head, he went back to Orlando with a positive attitude and put up 16 points in the first 15 games.\n\nThat production resulted in a late-November call up to the Marlies and Findlay has stuck with the Toronto AHLers ever since.\n\nFindlay played with Byron Froese, now in the National Hockey League with the Toronto Maple Leafs, in Orlando and said that gives players like himself hope that they can overcome the odds as well.\n\n“Obviously playing with Byron and seeing the path that he has taken it’s exciting for him and for other players like myself who have maybe taken a bit of a different route,” said the 23-year-old Findlay. “But it just goes to show you that if you believe in yourself and work every day that anything is possible.”\n\nFindlay credits his parents for the constant support they have given him throughout the ups and downs of his career.\n\nFor instance, when he was cut from the Soo North Stars in midget he began to doubt himself but his parents were there to encourage him. When he broke his leg in an ATV accident, his mother spent countless hours working with him on his skating.\n\nTo be sure, the support Findlay has received from his family has helped him come this close to his life-long dream of playing in the NHL.\n\nThe Marlies forward also gives credit to ex-Greyhound general manager and current Maple Leafs assistant GM Kyle Dubas for giving him a chance to show what he can do. Findlay noted that Dubas has been very honest with him as to what he likes and doesn’t like about his game — and that has helped him focus on what he needs to work on.\n\nFindlay has seemingly been making the best out of any situation thrown at him for his entire career and it doesn’t look like that will be changing anytime soon.\n\n“Every day I come to the rink it’s a new day to work on your skills and become a better player. To be on the best team in the entire AHL right now is pretty exciting.” — Brett Findlay\n\nThis article was originally posted at hockeynewsnorth.com written by Dylan Fremlin",
  "latent_633": "By Rebecca Velasquez, as told to Marisa Torrieri\n\nThis story originally appeared on LearnVest as ‘How Meditation Helped Me Save $25K, Strengthen My Marriage and Find Financial Clarity.’\n\nIn the LearnVest Personal Stories series, everyday people share the details of their money lives, discussing the individual choices they’ve made and how it’s impacted their financial journey.\n\nToday, one woman shares how meditation helped her finally take charge of her finances and, ultimately, find stability to support her growing family.\n\nMany people turn inward only after they’ve hit bottom and have lost everything. Not me.\n\nEleven years ago, before I began meditating, I had so many good things in my life. I’d graduated with a master’s degree from an Ivy League college, had a great job as a licensed clinical social worker and was celebrating one year of marriage to a wonderful man with whom I could travel the world.\n\nBut at that point in my life, I couldn’t say I was truly happy. I felt like my life lacked meaning. Something was “off”—I felt empty inside, but I didn’t know why.\n\nMeditation wasn’t immediately appealing to me even though others recommended it. My former boss, who had been meditating for 20 years, insisted I try it. He was the total opposite of what you might expect from a devotee—he was a stockbroker, had three kids and was always on the go. But I was skeptical and always found myself too busy to give it a chance.\n\nRELATED: Sunday Habits That Jump-Start Job Success All Week Long\n\nLater on, my minister also suggested I try meditation. By then, I was willing, so I began my journey inward to try to strengthen my spiritual life.\n\nThe First Breath\n\nWhen I started, nothing happened right away. The thing I've learned about meditation is that it’s a skill that has to be built up—it comes with practice. But I wasn’t so sure about that at first.\n\nI would sit quietly for a few minutes on my living-room sofa at 6 a.m. and listen to a body scan guided-relaxation CD. I wasn’t quite ready to follow my own breath in pure silence, so an audio guide seemed like a good first step. A voice walks you through the meditation session, helping to call your attention to how you're feeling in different parts of your body. This helped me feel more connected to my body, and I worked up to listening to it for 20 minutes a day. After about four months, I stopped listening to the CD. I was ready for the silence.\n\nMeanwhile, I read several books on meditation and looked into studies on people who have been doing it long-term, including research that found that as someone starts to meditate, the organization of their brain starts to change. For me, I found that as my mind began to quiet and de-clutter on the inside, I naturally wanted to clear up my outer world. This mindfulness helped me learn not to simply react to external stimuli but to respond to it thoughtfully before taking action, if at all.\n\nBy this point, I was meditating for about half an hour each morning, sometimes sitting cross-legged in my living room. I used a mantra—or a “tool for the mind”—which I repeated to myself to help focus my thoughts and follow my breath as it came in and went out. I also spoke regularly with my minister and another meditation mentor about the experiences, resistances and memories that would come up, so I could begin to process and work through them during my practice.\n\nA Realization\n\nAs I developed my routine, I found I was becoming more mindful of clutter in all parts of my life, from my thoughts to my relationships to the physical clutter in my home, except one—my money life. It was the one area that I realized was out of alignment with what I was doing in meditation: being more present and focused.\n\nThe more I reflected on this, the more the reality of my situation became clear: I had been using money in an incorrect way, and it was affecting my marriage. While my husband and I had steady jobs with a combined salary in the low six figures, the fact was, we were living paycheck to paycheck.\n\nGrowing up, I was never encouraged to manage my own money, and it became clear to me that I still wasn’t involved in my financial life. When I wanted something, I would just buy it and assume everything would work out ... or that others would take care of the bills or debt for me.\n\nRELATED: How Your Personality Could Influence Your Money Management Style\n\nThis blind spending took a turn when a routine supermarket trip jolted me to reality. I had just finished ringing up $200 in groceries when I pulled out my debit card, only to learn that I didn’t have enough funds in our joint checking account to foot the bill. Instead, I stood mortified in the checkout line and called my husband to bail me out.\n\nThis was just one scenario of many where my husband and I weren’t on the same financial page. “We can have all the love in the world, but if you’re not a financial partner, it won’t work,” he had said before. And I knew he was right—devastating as it was to hear, I knew that discord around money is a major component that can kill a marriage. If I wasn’t on my game around money, our relationship would suffer.\n\nThat was the extra push I needed to address my money issues head-on.\n\nGaining Financial Clarity\n\nTo finally become financially responsible, I joined a program to help me understand money-management basics. Before I meditated and became more mindful, I would not have been open to addressing my shortcomings, and the old me would have resisted this kind of help.\n\nThrough the program, I was taught the basics of creating a budget, tracking my spending and living within my means. I learned how important it was to step back to determine my wants versus my needs, something I had never distinguished before. I also learned how to build an emergency fund, and my husband and I started stashing $400 a month into a basic savings plan.\n\nWe sold things we didn’t need. We started watching our food bills more closely, sometimes trading shopping at our pricey organic supermarket for a budget grocer instead. We cut out extra snacks. I clipped coupons and we used the simple (yet effective) cash envelope system. Once the envelope was out of cash, the spending for that period of time stopped until we paid ourselves again, which we did every week.\n\nFour years passed, and my husband and I accumulated $25,000 in emergency savings. Then, we had our first child, and everything got a whole lot more challenging.\n\nRELATED: The Aha! Money Moment That Kickstarted My Plan to Get Out of Debt\n\nObstacles to Progress\n\nAs a new mom, I had to learn to adapt my meditation practice. Being up in the middle of the night every night with a newborn meant au revoir to 6 a.m. Zen time.\n\nThen came the tough realization that I didn’t want to go back to work after having a baby. While this is a completely normal decision families make all the time, problems arose because my husband and I had never discussed what our working situations would be with kids in the picture.\n\nThis created tension in both our relationship and our budget. Our financial situation didn’t easily allow us to eliminate my salary altogether while continuing to spend and save as much money as before. So when I didn’t return to my 9-to-5, we started dipping into our emergency fund to cover some expenses. On the bright side, because we had diligently saved $25,000 over the past four years, we had a safety net to work with and didn’t go into debt.\n\nI meditated throughout all these changes, which helped me stay flexible because I could respond to the transition instead of simply react as if it were out of my hands, which led me to embrace what came our way. A little more than a year ago, after our second child was about 18 months old, we decided to revisit our financial situation.\n\nBecause we’d depleted much of our emergency savings to help cover expenses for two young children, our new focus became rebuilding that cushion. We enrolled in a financial course together and learned how to create a prudent budget for our family of four, and in the last six months we’ve stashed $2,000 in emergency savings while not accruing new credit card debt.\n\nWe continue to pay our bills every month and hope to boost our emergency and retirement contributions very soon. It helps that I am now working part-time as a social worker as well as a private yoga and meditation teacher. Meditation was such a powerful tool for me to open up and address the problems in my various relationships, so it’s rewarding to be able to help others do the same.\n\nHad I not begun meditating all those years ago, I never would have confronted my money issues straight on. Meditation requires guidance and support as well as a willingness to take it on every single day. Once that willingness is there, it opens up a whole world of possibilities and revelations, which may end up benefiting your well-being—financial health included.",

  "latent_967": "The final day of JavaOne 2014 saw an extended Community Keynote, with technical material that had been omitted from the main keynote. Since then, the ideas presented there have been expanded on considerably. InfoQ caught up with Oracle's Brian Goetz (Java Language Architect) and John Rose (JVM Architect) for a deep-dive discussion on some of the technologies and features being discussed for Java 9 and beyond.\n\nInfoQ: In the JavaOne keynote, you drew a distinction between reification of generics versus primitive specialisation of generic types. That is, making the value of the type parameter available at runtime versus allowing collections of primitive types (such as ArrayList<int> ). Can you explain a little more?\n\nGoetz: People have quite an emotional distaste for type erasure, it seems to have this \"dirty smelly feel\". It's actually quite a practical technique and the set of problems it actually causes is pretty small. Boxing is inefficient; it uses more memory, undermines locality, and puts pressure on the garbage collector. It's great that ArrayList<T> can abstract across different Ts, but its not so great that the user has to suffer the pain of boxing to get the nice abstraction generics gives us when all they want is a list of ints.\n\nInfoQ: What about erased forms of interfaces which have lost information, such as overloads? I mean, you're not going to be able to have List<String> and List<Map<String , Integer >> as distinct types in Java 10, are you?\n\nGoetz: List<String> and List<Integer> have always been different types -- but these two types are represented by the same class at runtime. Erasure prevents us from recovering whether a given List at runtime started out as a List<String> or a List<Integer> before it got erased. A full-blown heterogeneous translation of generics, such as that provided by C++ templates, would map each of these types to a separate, unrelated class. We're not proposing that. But some instantiations, such as List<int> , might be represented by a different class than List<String> . That is, the mapping of compile-time types to runtime classes may work differently for primitive and value instantiations of List than for reference instantiations. Rose: Underlying this is that the equivalent of erased types for value types will show up in bytecode. Goetz: Put another way, developers who have been used to cheating with raw types or <?> are going to have to learn how to do this properly. As soon as we have specialisation and value types this is all much less forgiving. If you don't really know generics - this is the time to learn. We're already seeing some of this with lambdas, if you look at the Stack Overflow questions, a lot of the \"why can't I make lambdas do what I want?\" questions are really about an incorrect use of generics which is causing type inference to fail.\n\nInfoQ: Let's talk a bit about the possibility of Optional as a proto-value type.\n\nGoetz: There was potentially some slight optimism about the idea of migrating a Java 8 reference type to a Java 10 value type. Basically, we've laid the groundwork, by indicating that developers must not rely upon certain properties (such as identity checks) necessarily being true for types that may become value types in the future. Whether this migration proves to be doable in practice remains to be seen.\n\nInfoQ: Is the Java Native Runtime dead now with the advent of Project Panama?\n\nGoetz: JNR is now part of the Panama story, but there's a lot more in there than just JNR.\n\nInfoQ: Will there be JSRs for Panama and Valhalla, or technology coming from them? When will we know which Java releases are being target?\n\nRose: It's best to start a JSR when you've already got an idea of where you're going. The start of JSRs will fall somwhere between knowing which JDK release we're targetting and having a protoype people like. Goetz: This is similar to lambda, we started early in the OpenJDK project and we started the JSR when we knew what success for the project looked like, and we knew who the experts were, to form the Expert Group for the JSR. Rose: There is enormous value in JSRs, but we need a good starting point, for many reasons, but especially so that we don't form too early and waste the experts time. Goetz: We're fortunate in that now all the legal machinery is in place for developing JSRs in OpenJDK, we can develop completely in the open from the start. As to releases, watch the Valhalla repos. Especially watch for little pieces moving across into jdk9 / jdk10 repos - just like we did for lambdas.\n\nInfoQ: Can you speak to some of the projects that are out there regarding new approaches to data access - such as IBM Packed Objects, or Gil Tene's ObjectLayout project?\n\nRose: Java is 20 now, and people have been complaining about arrays since the start, so perhaps it's no surprise that we're coming to a consensus about what needs to change. A lot of these complaints and projects seem to be convergable to an api for getting to flat data. It does seem like we're getting to a place where we can start to prototype, and that's what Project Panama is for. IBM have been involved from the start, and there's a special mailing list so IBM VM engineers can participate (there are some IP walls that we've needed to work out, but we think we're there now). There are a few necessary changes to the language - e.g. value types, but we also have things like the VM thinking that all values are managed, and represented by pointers - both of these assumptions have to be overturned. We think we have a multi-language VM already, well - just wait and see what the future holds.\n\nInfoQ: Hazelcast, among others, have been asking for arrays that support long indicies. Is this possible?\n\nRose: All the new APIs for data we're working on have long indicies. Goetz: This is something we're working on, but in terms of new features, this is a very large combinatorial space - sparseness, size, read / write vs read-only vs append. Everyone has different wants, and we need to prioritise. Rose: There are many degrees of freedom here, like a pizza. The idea is that we don't want to treat \"pizza with mushrooms and onions\" as a completely separate combination from \"pizza with onions and peppers\"; that leads to 2^n combinations. Instead, you want to say \"pick any toppings\". We still need to do some work to define the menu. One common pattern is application managed slab data off to the side. Users have incremental management costs, so they want to manage data themselves. This leads to large numbers of app-formatted bytes, which leads directly to native access to data.\n\nFor more information on Project Panama visit here and for Project Valhalla see this article.

  "latent_1276": "When Fiona Bloom needed an air conditioner installed in her Bed-Stuy, Brooklyn, apartment three weeks ago, she went on Tinder.\n\nThe 47-year-old, who has been dating in NYC for the past 20 years, decided to put the app to use after being repeatedly disappointed by the city’s dating pool. “I’ve tried speed dating and all the dating apps, but every time I put my real age, all I get are idiots and losers,” Bloom, a publicist, tells The Post. “I figured, why not make them useful and have them help me around the house?”\n\nSo that afternoon, she swiped right on a 40-something bachelor. His default photo featured him wearing overalls and holding a hammer.\n\n“I wasn’t attracted to him, but he was very forthcoming,” she says. She messaged him, saying she was only looking for someone to come over to install her air conditioner, making it very clear it wasn’t a date.\n\nAfter he came over, opened her window and set up her AC, she said thank you — and promptly kicked him out. He later messaged her to go on a proper date, but she never replied and doesn’t regret it.\n\n“Men are hard-wired to feel strong and be a provider,” she says, noting she’s also used this method to hitch a ride to the Hamptons. “I don’t feel guilty using them for a little help.”\n\n‘Every time I put my real age, all I get are idiots and losers. I figured, why not make them useful and have them help me around the house?’ - Fiona Bloom on using dating apps to find handymen\n\nBloom isn’t the only city singleton using Tinder as a cost-effective way to find a handyman and get chores done — and experts say that’s OK, as long as women are upfront about their intentions.\n\n“If a man thinks waxing a woman’s floors will get him action, why not?” says Marni Kinrys, writer of LA dating blog WingGirlMethod.com. “This could be a great starting point for both parties to get to know each other.”\n\nBut other dating experts say it’s thinly veiled exploitation. “It just seems so transparently selfish,” says LA-based dating coach Evan Marc Katz. “It’s equivalent to the guy who has sex with a stranger and never calls her again.”\n\nPlus, it could be dangerous if the guy feels rejected after he tried winning her over by doing her chores. “You get the wrong guy on the wrong day, and he has anger issues and yeah — it could be a bad situation,” adds Katz.\n\nFor some, using Tinder as a one-stop shop for handymen has the added bonus of leading to romance.\n\n“I sent him a selfie of me sweating in my room, and he came over like a knight in shining armor,” says Lori of her now-boyfriend, Andrew, 28, whom she met on Tinder in 2014 when she was looking for someone to install her air conditioner. “I think men really like a damsel in distress,” adds Lori, a 24-year-old Greenpoint, Brooklyn-based social media editor who asked not to use her last name for professional reasons.\n\nJust don’t expect men to be asking women to do their dishes via the dating app. “I know no single woman in NYC who would ever do a man’s chores,” Kinrys says. “It feels like the 1960s.\n\n“They should go on Craigslist instead.”",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\nWritten by Max Röhrbein-Kling and Johannes Kuhlmann\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen we started working on the Android release of Galaxy on Fire 3 - Manticore, our goal was for everyone to be able to enjoy the same visual fidelity, no matter if playing on Android or iOS. On iOS, we were already using Metal to render the game. This helped us to push a lot of draw calls. We therefore decided to add Vulkan support to our in-house game engine, the ABYSS® Engine, and render our game with Vulkan on Android.\n\nVulkan was and still is quite a young API. It is the latest addition to the family of low-level graphics APIs that make rendering 3D graphics more efficient. We are not going to go into detail on all the advantages and features Vulkan has to offer. Instead we will focus on our experience with bringing our game to Vulkan in general and with Android as the target platform in particular.\n\nWhile there is a lot of high-quality content out there, you will not find too many first-hand reports on what actually happened to game developers or engine developers brave enough to go down the Vulkan rabbit hole. So, in this series of blog posts, we will mainly focus on the most interesting aspects of our implementation, before we shift over to the learnings we made along the way.\n\nThere will be five separate posts:\n\nIntroduction and Fundamentals (this post) Handling Resources and Assets What We have Learned Vulkan on Android Stats & Summary\n\nAs a disclaimer, the main objective of our Vulkan renderer was to ship a game. That means it is more pragmatic than perfected. Also, we have mainly done what worked for us. We have not used any fancy stuff like custom allocators, parallel command generation, reusing command buffers and so on. We do believe, though, that our implementation is still reasonably versatile and well done.\n\nSo, for the first post, let us talk about some of the most interesting aspects of our Vulkan renderer implementation.\n\nDescriptorSets\n\nDescriptorSets are rather unique to Vulkan as there is nothing like it in, for example, Metal. A DescriptorSet is basically a group of bindings that is used to get your data into shaders. To get your uniform/constant values and textures in there, you must update these DescriptorSets. The tricky thing is you cannot update them while they are in use. And, being in use here factors in the CPU (your code as well as the driver's) and the GPU. You can only update a DescriptorSet when the GPU does not need it anymore, i.e. it has finished rendering.\n\nSo, in order to update DescriptorSets (using vkUpdateDescriptorSets() ) and reuse them once you they can be reused, you would need to do a lot of tracking and management. We have ended up with two different solutions for uniforms and textures that solve this problem for us.\n\nFor uniforms, we use dynamic buffer offsets ( VK_DESCRIPTOR_TYPE_UNIFORM_BUFFER_DYNAMIC ). This way we can have one DescriptorSet per shader that we can reuse each time the shader is used for rendering. It has to be one per shader as the layout/bindings in the DescriptorSet depend on the uniforms declared in the shader. The dynamic offset removes the need for us to update the DescriptorSets per frame, but forces us to put all uniform data into a single buffer. This buffer needs to be large enough to fit the entirety of uniform data for however many frames we have simultaneously in the pipeline (again, CPU and GPU pipelines combined).\n\nThe texture bindings highlighted a homemade problem for us: our renderer interface allows us to render any model (mesh + shader) with arbitrary textures. As a result, the Vulkan renderer needed to be able to deal with objects changing textures every frame, even if that feature is not used all too often.\n\nAt first, we tried tracking and managing DescriptorSets for textures, reusing them once the GPU was done with them and basically calling vkUpdateDescriptorSets() once for each object to be drawn. However, this was way too slow. It more or less doubled the time we spent generating draw calls.\n\nWe then tried caching DescriptorSets for textures based on the shader and bound textures - a procedure that allows us to potentially share them between similar objects. Consequently, we now only need to update them when a previously unseen combination occurrs. Apparently, this works really well for us and means we almost never have to update the DescriptorSets again after the cache has been filled.\n\nSynchronization\n\nGetting the synchronization right was probably one of the hardest parts of implementing the Vulkan renderer. While it is not an extraordinarily tough problem per se, we did not even have to think about it in OpenGL or Metal, where the driver does the synchronization for you. In Vulkan, however, you may have artifacts appear randomly in the rendered image. To fix this, you need to find the place where you did not synchronize correctly.\n\nGenerally, there are two categories of synchronization problems you need to safeguard against:\n\nCPU <-> GPU synchronization GPU command <-> GPU command synchronization\n\nAn example for the first category is how we create meshes. Since we are targeting mobile devices where CPU and GPU share a unified memory, we place our mesh data in VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_VISIBLE_BIT memory. To upload the data, we map the mesh's buffer(s), memcpy the data into the buffer and then unmap buffer.\n\nFirst, we need to make sure the GPU does not access that buffer before we are done with the memcpy. In our case this is already guaranteed by our rendering interface. Our implementation provides a thread-safe way of creating mesh objects which is done synchronously on the calling thread before returning a pointer to the mesh object. This guarantees that a mesh cannot possibly be submitted for rendering before its data upload is complete.\n\nBut we still need to tell the GPU that we modified the memory because the device may have cached parts of the mesh buffer. We can either choose our buffer memory to also have the VK_MEMORY_PROPERTY_HOST_COHERENT_BIT or manually declare our modification by calling vkFlushMappedMemoryRanges() to commit our changes and invalidate relevant GPU caches.\n\nNext, we need to place a VkBufferMemoryBarrier in a command buffer before the first use of the mesh data. In this case, the barrier signals a write access by the host which needs to be made visible to shaders reading that buffer. As such the barrier needs to take effect between VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_HOST_BIT and VK_PIPELINE_STAGE_VERTEX_SHADER_BIT .\n\nThe second category of synchronization problems is mostly relevant for data that is read and modified during the rendering of a single frame. To highlight what problems can occur and how to solve them, let us take a look at how we generate command buffers and submit them to the graphics queue.\n\nBut first a bit of setup: For the sake of simplicity let us assume we created a swapchain with three images. In theory, all three images can simultaneously be in processing at different stages in the graphics pipeline at the same time. Since we cannot reuse command buffers before they are done executing, we also need three command buffers and three fences. We will be referring to these by index. We need two semaphores: the imageReadySemaphore and renderingFinishedSemaphore . We also need to keep track of the frameNumber , i.e. how many frames we have rendered already.\n\nWith that sorted out, we are ready to start. We need to acquire an image to render into by calling vkAcquireNextImageKHR() . Here, we pass in the imageReadySemaphore which will then be signalled once the image is ready to be accessed again. Noteworthy is that the images may be acquired in an arbitrary order.\n\nBefore we can start filling a command buffer, we need to check if it is ready. We determine the frameIndex (between 0 and 2) via the frameNumber :\n\nframeIndex = frameNumber % 3\n\nWe then wait for the fence[frameIndex] . Now we can reset fence[frameIndex] as well as commandBuffer[frameIndex] and then start filling the command buffer with commands. This part is entirely up to you. The next interesting thing for synchronization purposes is the submission.\n\nFor the vkQueueSubmit() of your rendering commands you need to pass in the imageReadySemaphore to wait on. The renderingFinishedSemaphore and the fence[frameIndex] have to be signalled. We need to wait on the imageReadySemaphore to prevent rendering into our image before the image is actually ready for reuse as determined by the swapchain. Similarly, we want to signal the renderingFinishedSemaphore . It will not only be used for presentation, but also have the device signal the fence corresponding to the command buffer we are submitting once it is done.\n\nFinally, it is time to present. vkQueuePresentKHR() needs to wait on the renderingFinishedSemaphore , otherwise the image might be displayed on the screen before all commands have finished.\n\nWhat we found helpful when tracking down synchronization issues was to place vkDeviceWaitIdle() calls in code sections which are most likely to have synchronization problems. Sometimes the nature of the rendering artifacts lets you make assumptions about what is going wrong. The vkDeviceWaitIdle() will not tell you how to fix the issue correctly and you certainly do not want to use it in production code. Still, it can highlight where synchronization is missing in the code.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis post addressed two challenges you are likely to face with Vulkan: DescriptorSets and synchronization. Both are not necessarily common in other graphics APIs and may therefore be difficult to integrate into an existing engine. It is, however, essential to get them right as you will be plagued by crashes and visual corruption otherwise.\n\nIn the next post, we will talk about assets like textures and shaders as well as graphics pipelines.",

В заметке сообщается, что Александрина Маркво, гражданская жена Владимира Ашуркова (соратника Навального) побеждала на конкурсах на проведение ряда мероприятий, организованных правительством Москвы. Из этого, почему-то, авторы делали вывод о том, что Кремль финансировал политическую деятельность Навального. Хотя эта информация не представляла из себя не только ничего криминального, но и ничего скандального, ее стали активно тиражировать кремлевские же СМИ. Немедленно «возбудился» и следственный комитет и начал «проверку» этих сообщений, причем с выемкой документов он пришел в правительство Москвы. Ключевыми фигурами, оказавшимися в центре внимания следствия, стали заммэра по вопросам региональной безопасности и информационной политики Александр Горбенко и замруководителя Роспечати Владимир Григорьев.\n\nСразу после публикации Lifenews Итар-Тасс дало в ленте новостей комментарий анонимного источника из Администрации президента:\n\nПОЛИТИКА: КРЕМЛЬ-СМИ-НАВАЛЬНЫЙ\n\nИнформация о финансировании Навального из Кремля — бред и погоня за рейтингами, заявил источник в администрации президента\n\nМОСКВА, 6 ноября. /ТАСС/. В администрации президента РФ назвали бредом информацию о якобы финансировании Алексея Навального из Кремля.\n\n«Информация о финансировании из Кремля — полный бред и погоня за рейтингами, при всем уважении к LifeNews», — заявил ТАСС источник в Кремле. «А что касается достоверности опубликованных документов — нужно проверять», — добавил он.\n\nКак следует из вскрытой переписки, источником у Итар-Тасс был Тимур Прокопенко, замглавы Управления внутренней политики Администрации президента. И все бы хорошо, но черновик этого комментария в почте Прокопенко составлен еще вечером 5 ноября, когда никакой заметки Lifenews еще не было и в помине:\n\nАвтор заметки в Lifenews — Анастасия Кашеварова. The Insider уже писал о том как она и ранее ставила заказные материалы, подготовленные Тимуром Прокопенко. Но постоянные читатели помнят и о другом, начальник Кашеваровой — Арам Габрелянов — поставил на поток в своих изданиях заказуху от московского правительства, причем все тот же Горбенко этим внедрением джинсы в российских СМИ и руководил, будучи ответственным за информационную политику. Получается, что Габрелянов поработал на два фронта?\n\nСразу после публикации статью даже сняли с сайта на пару часов, а автор заметки Анастасия Кашеварова заявила, что Арам Габрелянов закатил ей скандал и едва не уволил ее. Это сложно представить, учитывая то, что материал был согласован заранее и вряд ли мог быть поставлен без его ведома. Так или иначе, вскоре в одном из писем-напоминалок самому себе Тимур Прокопенко напротив имени Габрелянова поставит «5 млн». Может быть, конечно, это вознаграждение полагалось и за какие-то другие заслуги, но так или иначе в обиде он явно не остался.\n\nЧто же касается Прокопенко, то он продолжал не только активно отслеживать реакцию на эту статью, но и даже организовал публикацию тематических комиксов (как всегда, поражающих глубиной и остроумием):\n\nМежду тем, по данным The Insider Александр Горбенко продолжает находиться под следствием. А Прокопенко до сих пор, несмотря на все вскрывшиеся факты, не только не находится под следствием, но и, наоборот, неплохо живет. Об этом — в следующем разделе.",
  "latent_1808": "The Case Against Aaron Swartz Was Complete Garbage\n\nfrom the whether-or-not-it-had-an-impact dept\n\nHere is where we need a better sense of justice, and shame. For the outrageousness in this story is not just Aaron. It is also the absurdity of the prosecutor’s behavior. From the beginning, the government worked as hard as it could to characterize what Aaron did in the most extreme and absurd way. The “property” Aaron had “stolen,” we were told, was worth “millions of dollars” — with the hint, and then the suggestion, that his aim must have been to profit from his crime. But anyone who says that there is money to be made in a stash of ACADEMIC ARTICLES is either an idiot or a liar. It was clear what this was not, yet our government continued to push as if it had caught the 9/11 terrorists red-handed.\n\nAaron had literally done nothing in his life “to make money.” He was fortunate Reddit turned out as it did, but from his work building the RSS standard, to his work architecting Creative Commons, to his work liberating public records, to his work building a free public library, to his work supporting Change Congress/FixCongressFirst/Rootstrikers, and then Demand Progress, Aaron was always and only working for (at least his conception of) the public good. He was brilliant, and funny. A kid genius. A soul, a conscience, the source of a question I have asked myself a million times: What would Aaron think? That person is gone today, driven to the edge by what a decent society would only call bullying. I get wrong. But I also get proportionality. And if you don’t get both, you don’t deserve to have the power of the United States government behind you.\n\nIn that world, the question this government needs to answer is why it was so necessary that Aaron Swartz be labeled a “felon.” For in the 18 months of negotiations, that was what he was not willing to accept, and so that was the reason he was facing a million dollar trial in April — his wealth bled dry, yet unable to appeal openly to us for the financial help he needed to fund his defense, at least without risking the ire of a district court judge. And so as wrong and misguided and fucking sad as this is, I get how the prospect of this fight, defenseless, made it make sense to this brilliant but troubled boy to end it.\n\nMr. Swartz's lawyer, Elliot Peters, first discussed a possible plea bargain with Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen Heymann last fall. In an interview Sunday, he said he was told at the time that Mr. Swartz would need to plead guilty to every count, and the government would insist on prison time.\n\nMr. Peters said he spoke to Mr. Heymann again last Wednesday in another attempt to find a compromise. The prosecutor, he said, didn't budge\n\nThe government indicated it might only seek seven years at trial, and was willing to bargain that down to six to eight months in exchange for a guilty plea, a person familiar with the matter said. But Mr. Swartz didn't want to do jail time.\n\n\"I think Aaron was frightened and bewildered that they'd taken this incredibly hard line against him,\" said Mr. Peters, his lawyer. \"He didn't want to go to jail. He didn't want to be a felon.\"\n\nI know a criminal hack when I see it, and Aaron’s downloading of journal articles from an unlocked closet is not an offense worth 35 years in jail. The facts: MIT operates an extraordinarily open network. Very few campus networks offer you a routable public IP address via unauthenticated DHCP and then lack even basic controls to prevent abuse. Very few captured portals on wired networks allow registration by any vistor, nor can they be easily bypassed by just assigning yourself an IP address. In fact, in my 12 years of professional security work I have never seen a network this open.\n\nIn the spirit of the MIT ethos, the Institute runs this open, unmonitored and unrestricted network on purpose. Their head of network security admitted as much in an interview Aaron’s attorneys and I conducted in December. MIT is aware of the controls they could put in place to prevent what they consider abuse, such as downloading too many PDFs from one website or utilizing too much bandwidth, but they choose not to.\n\nMIT also chooses not to prompt users of their wireless network with terms of use or a definition of abusive practices.\n\nAt the time of Aaron’s actions, the JSTOR website allowed an unlimited number of downloads by anybody on MIT’s 18.x Class-A network. The JSTOR application lacked even the most basic controls to prevent what they might consider abusive behavior, such as CAPTCHAs triggered on multiple downloads, requiring accounts for bulk downloads, or even the ability to pop a box and warn a repeat downloader.\n\nAaron did not “hack” the JSTOR website for all reasonable definitions of “hack”. Aaron wrote a handful of basic python scripts that first discovered the URLs of journal articles and then used curl to request them. Aaron did not use parameter tampering, break a CAPTCHA, or do anything more complicated than call a basic command line tool that downloads a file in the same manner as right-clicking and choosing “Save As” from your favorite browser.\n\nAaron did nothing to cover his tracks or hide his activity, as evidenced by his very verbose .bash_history, his uncleared browser history and lack of any encryption of the laptop he used to download these files. Changing one’s MAC address (which the government inaccurately identified as equivalent to a car’s VIN number) or putting a mailinator email address into a captured portal are not crimes. If they were, you could arrest half of the people who have ever used airport wifi.\n\nThe government provided no evidence that these downloads caused a negative effect on JSTOR or MIT, except due to silly overreactions such as turning off all of MIT’s JSTOR access due to downloads from a pretty easily identified user agent.\n\nI cannot speak as to the criminal implications of accessing an unlocked closet on an open campus, one which was also used to store personal effects by a homeless man. I would note that trespassing charges were dropped against Aaron and were not part of the Federal case. In short, Aaron Swartz was not the super hacker breathlessly described in the Government’s indictment and forensic reports, and his actions did not pose a real danger to JSTOR, MIT or the public. He was an intelligent young man who found a loophole that would allow him to download a lot of documents quickly. This loophole was created intentionally by MIT and JSTOR, and was codified contractually in the piles of paperwork turned over during discovery.\n\nGiven the disclosures by Swartz's expert, Alex Stamos, which are linked at the beginning of this post, it seems that Swartz had a strong argument that he did indeed have \"authorization.\" As Stamos says, at the time of Swartz's downloads, \"the JSTOR website allowed an unlimited number of downloads by anybody on MIT’s 18.x Class-A network\" and \"Aaron did not use parameter tampering, break a CAPTCHA, or do anything more complicated than call a basic command line tool that downloads a file in the same manner as right-clicking and choosing 'Save As' from your favorite browser.\"\n\nThus, all Swartz did was write a script to find and download the files. As a factual matter, that may have been \"authorization,\" rendering it lawful everywhere. Even if the script was \"exceeding authorization,\" if the First Circuit had adopted the same rule as the Fourth Circuit and the Ninth Circuit, then Swartz would likely have been not guilty as a matter of law. All of which further shows why this prosecution should not have been brought in the first place; the prosecutor is supposed to exercise their judgment to do justice.\n\nElliot Peters, Swartz's California-based defense attorney and a former federal prosecutor in Manhattan, told The Associated Press on Sunday that the case \"was horribly overblown\" because Swartz had \"the right\" to download from JSTOR, a subscription service used by MIT that offers digitized copies of articles from more than 1,000 academic journals.\n\nPeters said even the company took the stand that the computer crimes section of the U.S. Attorney's Office in Boston had overreached in seeking prison time for Swartz and insisting , two days before his suicide , that he plead guilty to all 13 felony counts. Peters said JSTOR's attorney, Mary Jo White , the former top federal prosecutor in Manhattan , had called Stephen Heymann, the lead Boston prosecutor in the case.\n\n\"She asked that they not pursue the case,\" Peters said.\n\nAs I stated in my initial post about Aaron Swartz's death , I don't think it's fair to \"blame\" the DOJ or others on Aaron's suicide -- just as I don't think it's fair to blame anyone's suicide on a third party, no matter how horrible their actions. That said, the DOJ's actions in this casequite clearly, and since the case will now never go forward, it seems imperative to highlight just how badly the DOJ acted in this case.Larry Lessig's post made some clear points suggesting that the feds and MIT were out of line in pursuing this case, which seems like an understatement:Lessig made it clear that the feds sought to get Aaron to agree to a plea deal, in which he'd plead guilty to some aspect of the charges against him, in exchange for letting him off on the more serious charges. Aaron did an amazing thing and refused, believing that he had not done anything wrong:And, for those who don't think that pushing back against the feds is an amazing thing, you have no clue how much pressure the federal government can put on you when it wants you to plead guilty. Two years ago I wrote about a documentary called Better This World , which is about an entirely different subject, but really opened my eyes to the way the feds handle some of these cases. It's not about what's right. It is entirely about them winning, getting the press coverage and \"making examples\" of people. And they'll go to amazing lengths, and create pressure that you and I can only have nightmares about, to get people to accept bogus \"plea\" deals, just so they can notch up another \"win.\" It's scary, scary stuff. Fighting back may have been the right thing to do, but must have created a level of stress unimaginable to most people.The WSJ has provided more details about the hard line that federal prosecutors had taken with Aaron, including last week's demand that he plead guilty to all counts and spend time in jail:In exchange for pleading guilty across the board, Heymann apparently promised that they would ask for a shorter sentence, though that's never a guarantee:The report also notes that his girlfriend was unaware of any depressive episodes until right after Wednesday's decision by Heymann to refuse to budge on jailtime and a guilty plea on all counts.As for the details of the case itself, they were absurd -- and it is no wonder that Swartz refused to plead guilty. Back in September, we delved into the ridiculous details of the final indictment -- which upped the felony count, all of which was based on the idea that he had done some sort of massive computer hacking for the sake of some criminal conspiracy. And yet... that was clearly never the case. As Tim Lee detailed , at worst, it appeared that Swartz might possibly be guilty of. Yes, he went into a computer closet at MIT, but he got access to a network which was open for all, and he downloaded documents that were made available freely to all on that network.Many people have reasonably pointed to a blog post from Alex Stamos, the CTO of Artemis Internet, who had been brought on as an expert witness on Aaron's behalf. After demonstrating that his reports have been used on behalf of prosecutors in attacks, and pointing out that he's no friend of hackers, Stamos highlights in detail just how completely bogus the charges against Swartz were That's from someone who clearly had detailed knowledge about the situation. Other legal experts had come to similar conclusions after the original indictment came out. Way back when, we had pointed to an article by Max Kennerly in which he looked closely at the indictment and was left confused as to how it got as far as it did. Kennerly has since updated his post (both after the new indictment and again over the weekend, in which he notes that Stamos' post suggest that his own original analysis didn't even go far enough after discovering the details). Kennerly looked at how the case really revolved around whether or not Swartz's activities violated the terms of service, but given the details of the case, combined with Stamos' commentsthe fact that (since Swartz was charged) multiple courts have ruled that a mere terms of service violation isa violation of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA), this case seemed to have absolutely nothing legitimate.Separately, it has been pointed out numerous times that the only real party who had any reasonable claim to \"harm\" was JSTOR, and it had said from early on that it had settled its issue with Swartz when he agreed to turn over his hard drive with everything he'd downloaded. Now, a bit more has come out, as apparently JSTOR itself asked federal prosecutors to drop the case So even the supposedly \"harmed\" party didn't want the case to go forward. And yet, Stephen Heymann kept pushing.The case is now gone, so we'll never see how a judge rules on it. We can hope that, given everything above, a judge would have clearly seen what a joke the case was, and dismissed it. But, you never know how judges will rule, and especially when they're not very technically savvy, they'll give a ridiculous amount of deference to federal prosecutors, merely because of their position. But the ridiculousness of the case should be pointed out over and over again to remind everyone of the problems we get when the federal government gets too powerful, and knows that it can use that power against someone it doesn't like.Whether or not the impending trial contributed to Swartz's death, one thing is undeniable: the case itself was a complete farce, and that should not be forgotten. One hopes that, among other things, one of the legacies of Swartz's death may be to fix broken laws that allowed this prosecution to move forward, and to figure out a way to dial back the aggressiveness with which federal prosecutors take on cases these days.\n\nFiled Under: aaron swartz, cfaa, copyright, doj, hacking, legal issues, pressure, stephen heymann, us attorneys",
  "latent_1952": "For the wealthy, a return to luxury spending\n\nWealthy Americans seem to have decided that it's OK to splurge again — a hopeful sign for an economy mired by slow growth, stubbornly high unemployment and depressed home prices.\n\nLuxury and high-end marketers have picked up on what they hope is a growing trend, offering products that bank on a looming spending spree. Germany's PG-Bikes is rolling out the $80,000 Black Trail, a battery-powered bicycle. Swiss watchmaker Richard Mille is selling $525,000 timepieces. Steinway has launched a John Lennon-themed grand piano — at $90,000 and up. After selling out a $245,000 model, automaker Porsche is planning the 918 Spyder, a hybrid car that could sell for more than $630,000.\n\nAnd for the 2011 holiday season, tech start-up Prima Cinema will provide a $20,000 device to bring Hollywood films to your home the same day they premiere in theaters. Each first-run film will cost an additional $500.\n\nThe products represent rarified shopping territory for even the uber-rich, especially at a time when the nation is coming out of its worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. To many still worried about the economy, spending for luxury goods and ultra-toys with eye-popping price tags is silly. Even so, the trickle of high-end products aimed at deep-pocketed clientele is a potential leading indicator of a broader wave of pervasive conspicuous consumption among middle- and upper-income shoppers, analysts say.\n\n\"If the wealthy are buying, there's a huge downstream effect: It goes all the way down to the $50,000 (annual income) household,\" says Selling to the New Elite author Jim Taylor, a marketing specialist with luxury brand consultant Harrison Group, whose annual Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America with American Express Publishing Group gauges shopping sentiment of the affluent.\n\nConsumer spending is the main driver of economic growth. The nation's wealthiest 5% of households account for about 37% of consumer spending, according to Moody's Analytics.\n\nSome wealthy consumers have reined in over-the-top spending. Pam Danziger, whose Unity Marketing consultancy specializes in luxury branding, says that Baby Boomers, who make up a large chunk of wealthy households, have tempered shopping urges.\n\n\"The male source of pride used to be on how much they spent on fancy TVs, technology and other toys,\" Danziger says. \"Now the bragging rights are over finding things at great prices. The mind-set at the luxury level and high end has changed.\"\n\nEven so, pent-up demand for luxury goods appears to have lessened the angst of other well-heeled shoppers. Luxury carmakers such as Porsche and marketers such as Mille say they've had little trouble lining up customers, wait-listing some and fielding offers from others willing to pay premiums.\n\nRich come out of hiding Percentage of people with discretionary income of at least $100,000 a year who agree with the following statements: *Among women\n\nSource: The Survey of Affluence and Wealth in America by American Express and Harrison Group\n\nWall Street's gains have helped put many in the mood to shop. Since hitting a 12-year low of 6547 in March 2009, the Dow Jones industrial average has surged 89% to 12,391.\n\n\"When Wall Street crashed, it was very unsettling among the kings and queens of the universe,\" notes Wendy Liebmann, CEO of consultant WSL Strategic Retail. \"It was as much about mind-set as it was about money. They just stopped spending because it wasn't appropriate to be seen spending. But the affluent are willing to spend again.\"\n\nRetail analysts sensed a coming shopping spree by the affluent as stock prices began climbing last fall. By the holidays, tony retailers such as Neiman Marcus, Saks, Nordstrom and Tiffany were posting December same-store sales gains of up to 10% over the previous holiday season. Earlier this month, upscale retailer Ralph Lauren reported a 24% gain in quarterly revenue, while high-end grocery chain Whole Foods Market posted a 12.6% gain.\n\n\"Personal embracement of luxury is now back to (pre-recession) 2007 levels,\" Taylor says. \"We're seeing that in cars, private jet usage and, finally, in high-end real estate. There's a real change in the way people feel about money. They're making purchases they put off during the recession.\"\n\nPorsche's U.S. sales in 2010 were up 29% over 2009; Cadillac's climbed 36%. Rolls-Royce sales rocketed 171%.\n\nVacation home sales in Cape Cod, Mass., rose 9% in 2010, compared with 2009. In Hilton Head, S.C., sales were up nearly 14%. Palm Beach, Fla., home sales surged nearly 40%.\n\nLuxury home sales in hard-hit Southern California also are beginning to rebound.\n\n\"We're starting to see movement,\" says Madison Hildebrand, who specializes in Beverly Hills and Malibu listings and stars on the Bravo reality show Million Dollar Listing. \"People are more confident.\"\n\nThe market for $1 million-plus yachts is also poised to set sail, says Thom Dammrich, president of the National Marine Manufacturers Association. \"There's a high-quality crowd seriously looking to buy. That's changed since the downturn, which was brutal.\"\n\nEven high-end art is drawing post-recession buyers. Sotheby's and Christie's, which handle more than 90% of fine art, book and collectibles sales, pulled in $1.1 billion during their fall auctions, almost double from 2009.\n\n\"The market hasn't completely recovered, but there were five (art) sales over $50 million last year. That's unprecedented, even during boom times,\" says Katherine Jentleson, analytics director at industry tracker Art Research Technologies. \"There's clearly a lust for extreme luxury items.\"\n\nOptimism for 2011\n\nIvan Drury, an analyst for auto industry tracker Edmunds.com, estimates that the market for vehicles costing $100,000 and more surged 76% last year — 32,144 sales, up from 18,288 in 2009. Porsche, which has received more than 2,000 orders nearly three years ahead of the hybrid 918's production, needed just two months to sell all 500 of its new 911 GT2 RS sports cars — priced at $245,000. More than 25% were snapped up by U.S. buyers.\n\nSome marketers, such as AutoNation, sense fresh opportunity among newly affluent consumers and aspirational buyers. The nation's largest auto retailer will spend $100 million through 2012 on new and renovated showrooms for Mercedes-Benz, BMW, Audi, Land Rover and Infinitis.\n\nKorea's Hyundai, best known for low-priced vehicles, steered into the luxury market with December's launch of the Equus. Prices start at $58,000 to $64,500.\n\nWealthTV, a San Diego-based cable channel focusing on luxury lifestyles, hopes to expand its affluent audience and lure upscale advertisers with this month's launch of Social, a 26-episode series featuring former Real Housewives of New Jersey socialite Danielle Staub mingling with the rich and famous. The channel already has seen a rebound for advertising from travel operators.\n\n\"We were fighting an uphill battle with the recession,\" says WealthTV President Charles Herring. \"This year, we project to double what we did last year in advertising.\"\n\nEven so, Liebmann says the recession has altered some habits.\n\n\"The wealthy have learned some lessons. Like the rest of us working stiffs, they're buying selectively things they feel are really worth the price,\" she says. \"It's as much about mind-set as it is about money.\"\n\nLike most of us, the wealthy want a good deal. Cadillac credits part of last year's success on the perceived value of its free, four-year/50,000-mile scheduled maintenance program.\n\nCadillac and other luxury marketers are also tweaking their mantras. Latest TV ads highlight power and technology.\n\n\"It's a good time to be targeting luxury consumers, but the market is extremely competitive,\" says Cadillac marketing chief Don Butler. \"We wanted ads that are visceral and emotionally engaging, but also showing that Cadillac has changed. We're no longer part of the same old club.\"\n\nAudi's Super Bowl ad touted the technology-centric \"new luxury\" of its A8 model over rival Mercedes.\n\nWhile some luxury marketers were slashing prices, Steinway rode out plummeting sales by cutting production and factory workers, relying on the brand's recession-proof reputation. Third-quarter sales were up 11% over 2009.\n\n\"We have customers who don't even play the piano; they look at them as investments,\" says Ron Losby, president of Steinway & Sons-Americas.\n\nIts 50 Lennon-edition models, inspired by the late ex-Beatle's gift to Yoko Ono, have great potential value, Losby says. \"There'll be no sleepless nights. We'll sell them all.\"\n\nMarketing exclusivity\n\nThe cool factor, not investment value, is a chief selling point of PG-Bikes' Black Trail. It has ultra-light carbon-fiber components and is powered by a battery capable of propelling riders at up to 62 mph.\n\n\"The idea wasn't to create the most expensive bike, but the most technically advanced, lightest-weight electric bike,\" says company founder Manu Ostner. \"Rich, successful people don't care about price. They care about quality and having something unique.\"\n\nProduction will be limited to about 700 bikes. Ostner expects to sell 250 to U.S. customers, hoping high-profile early adopters such as actor Orlando Bloom and Wall Street power players will spur interest for PG's lower-priced models. \"They're the trendsetters who'll generate the sensibility and sexiness of clean mobility,\" Ostner says.\n\nWhat makes Richard Mille's watch worth $525,000? The Rafael Nadal RM 027 Tourbillon is more about technology than glitz, featuring titanium and carbon composites used in satellites. At less than 20 grams, it is billed as the world's lightest wristwatch. Spanish tennis star Nadal wears his on the courts.\n\nJust 50 will be made, attracting collectors and well-heeled wearers. Before its August launch, Mille had more than 100 orders.\n\n\"It may be ostentatious driving a new luxury car in your neighborhood or around co-workers, but a guy across the room wouldn't know what this watch is,\" says Dominique Gerente, Mille's marketing chief for North and South America. \"It's much more personal. With this watch, you become a member of a club.\"\n\nCurrent \"members\" include rapper/entertainment mogul Jay-Z and musician Seal. No worries if you're not on the list. In September, Mille's rolling out the RM038 Bubba Watson, named for the professional golfer, also for $525,000. Want something cheaper? Mille watches start at about $50,000.\n\nForking out as much for a watch as a car or home makes Prima Cinema's $20,000 home movie-premiere service seem a relative bargain.\n\nStill, there were plenty of skeptics when CEO Jason Pang initially approached movie studios and investors for partnership deals for the technology, previously available to Hollywood VIPS, during the recession.\n\n\"It sounded elitist. They didn't think anyone would pay $20,000 for the technology, and there was sticker shock at $500 movies,\" Pang says. \"But then you tell them that people spend hundreds of thousands on custom home theaters or $20,000 to charter private jets. And when you take your family to an NBA game or host a kids' birthday party, you're spending hundreds of dollars.\"\n\nNow that partnerships are in place, Pang expects to sell his digital delivery system to 250,000 households by 2015. \"Word of mouth is driving sales, and we're not even trying,\" he says.\n\nWall Street's extended post-recession rally likely will continue to goose sales of high-end items.

  "latent_2058": "The Besiktas player is back in the Dutch squad for the first time since 2011, and the intervening six years have seen Babel and Holland slip into decline\n\nOn 28 August 2015, a little over five years since he watched from the bench as Holland lost the World Cup final to Spain, Ryan Babel got himself caught up in a Twitter storm. Babel aimed a dig at Rafael Benítez, the man who brought him to Liverpool, and then he ended up sparking a sexism furore after an ill-advised response to a female fan who had disagreed with the initial post from a stagnant 28-year-old footballer who had seen better days.\n\nWhat formation did Holland's Total Football side actually play? Read more\n\nIt was a classic example of there being such a thing as bad publicity because not only did Babel look like an idiot, the controversy was also a brief reminder of his squandered talent. The story started and ended there, quickly dying down once it became clear that no one cared that much about a social media meltdown from someone who had just left a lowly Turkish team for UAE club Al Ain. Babel’s wider relevance had faded long ago. At a time when he should have been hitting his peak, playing in the Middle East hammered home his heavy fall from grace.\n\nTwo years on from that sorry episode, a player who was once tipped by his former national coach, Marco van Basten, to become the next Thierry Henry is back in the headlines for the right reasons. Babel has been called up by Holland for the first time since November 2011, after enjoying quite the turnaround in 2017. Though moving to Deportivo La Coruña did not work out after he ended his unhappy spell at Al Ain, he has rediscovered his spark since joining Besiktas in January. His excellent form for the Turkish champions convinced Dick Advocaat to name him in his squad for Holland’s final two World Cup qualifiers, when they will make one last attempt to avoid the ignominy of failing to make it to Russia.\n\nIt is a praiseworthy achievement from Babel even if the forward owes his spot to the absence of the injured Quincy Promes. There have been signs of a more mature, focused outlook in recent months. He has scored five times in nine games this season, with goals in the wins against Porto and RB Leipzig taking Besiktas to the top of their Champions League group and showing that he is still capable of flourishing at the highest level.\n\nAbout time, you might say. Babel turns 31 in December and that is why there is also a bittersweet tinge to Babel’s return from international exile, not just for the player but also for Dutch football as a whole.\n\nPerhaps it is unfair to home in on that unfortunate tweet again, but it represents a distinct career low for Babel, after years of stasis from a player who was meant to be one of the stars of his generation. Babel was the man of the match when Holland beat Serbia 4-1 to win the European Under-21 Championship in 2007. He was a product of Ajax’s youth system and it was hailed as a major coup when Liverpool bought him for £11.5m later that summer.\n\nYet despite a promising first season in England, it never quite happened for Babel. He tailed off at Anfield and eventually joined Hoffenheim in January 2011. Time was still on his side, but football doesn’t wait. Hoffenheim let him go back to Ajax, who moved him on to Kasimpasa in Turkey after a year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ryan Babel’s Liverpool career fizzled out and he left in 2011 after three and a half years at Anfield. Photograph: Javier Soriano/AFP/Getty Images\n\nYou have to go back to 11 November 2011 for Babel’s last Holland appearance, in a 0-0 friendly draw with Switzerland. He returns to find a great footballing nation struggling to come to terms with its diminished standing. World Cup finalists in 2010 and semi-finalists in 2014, Holland’s crisis has not eased since their failure to reach Euro 2016.\n\nThese are tough times. Advocaat’s side are third in their qualifying group with two matches left, three points behind Sweden and four behind France. Their fate could be sealed if they do not win in Belarus on Saturday night, with Sweden hosting Luxembourg before coming to Amsterdam on Tuesday. Even if Holland were able to squeak into the World Cup via the play-offs, they would not be among the favourites.\n\nRobin van Persie, Arjen Robben and Wesley Sneijder have all moved into their 30s without being adequately replaced. Sneijder has been left out of the squad after struggling at Nice, but it does not reflect well on the players who have emerged over the last decade that the 33-year-old is still in the frame despite his decline since 2010.\n\nGareth Southgate must give freedom a chance after numbing England spectacle | Barney Ronay Read more\n\nBabel has often been accused of lacking desire, a facile conclusion to reach about a young black man who likes to rap in his spare time. It seems an inaccurate reading of someone who survived growing up in the Bijlmermeer, a tough part of Amsterdam, to become a talented professional footballer. Yet he is also an emblem of Holland’s decline.\n\nBabel made his international debut in a World Cup qualifier away to Romania in 2005, scoring the clincher in a 2-0 win after replacing the injured Robben in the 22nd minute. He looked like the future, but his four subsequent goals have come in friendlies.\n\nPerhaps Babel’s recall is the start of a fairytale – scoring winners against Belarus and Sweden and earning redemption as he drags the wounded Dutch to the World Cup – but for now it feels like a reminder of his wasted potential and Holland’s lost generation.",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nAfter weeks of criticism, Germany’s Left Party in the country’s most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) appears to have withdrawn its anti-Israel initiative.\n\nOn its Twitter account on Sunday, the Left Party in NRW said, “Motion to the situation in Palestine will not be dealt with.” The NRW Left Party did not immediately respond to The Jerusalem Post’s queries on Monday.\n\nThe initiative was proposed for passage at the NRW’s Left Party congress on Sunday. The motion called on Israel “to end the occupation and the Gaza blockade” and urged the European Union to end its association agreement with Israel because of the Gaza blockade and Israel’s “construction of a border wall that violates international law.”In response to the motion in early October, Martina Renner, a Left Party MP, wrote on Twitter that the “motion sounds like it was written from Israel boycott groups. From this the executive board of @dielinke clearly distances itself.”Some of the signatories to the motion blasting Israel have, over the years, been accused of stoking antisemitism and hatred of the Jewish state in Germany. The Simon Wiesenthal Center included MP Inge Höger, one of the motion’s supporters, on its list of top 10 antisemitic/anti-Israel incidents in 2014.According to the center, there were “ongoing efforts to demonize Israel by a group of extreme anti-Israel MPs, led by Inge Höger and Annette Groth.Both of these parliamentarians were onboard the controversial 2010 Mavi Marmara Gaza flotilla and upon their return to Berlin, were hailed by many of their party’s MPs.”Höger played a role in bringing extremists of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel to the Bundestag in 2014.MP Ulla Jelpke, who supported the motion, previously said: “I consider it legitimate to be against Zionism. After all, it has apartheid-like characteristics.”The three-page motion said 2017 is the 100-year anniversary of the Balfour Declaration “in which the former colonial power Great Britain unilaterally created a Jewish home state.”Journalist Stefan Laurin first reported on the NRW’s Left Party motion, writing on the website Ruhrbarone that the party foments “incitement against Israel.” He said the motion shows “how deep the hate of Israel” is within the Left Party in NRW.Laurin wrote that the NRW’s Left Party did not mention in the motion that the blockade against the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip is also maintained by Egypt. He added that the blockade was the Jewish state’s reaction to “permanent attacks of Hamas on Israel.”Laurin said it is the “terroristic Hamas with its regime that is responsible for the misery in Gaza.” He added, “Hamas builds shopping centers and villas for its corrupt leadership.”The Left Party in NRW, a state with roughly 18 million people, did not secure votes to re-enter the state parliament in this year’s election.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

  "latent_2507": "For a mile outside Canton Multipurpose Complex on Saturday, the road was backed up. Many cars sported bumper stickers, pro-Bernie and pro-union.\n\n'I was naive': after losing healthcare battle, factory workers fear next blow Read more\n\nThey came in school buses, hot rods, church vans and motorcycles, with license plates from Missouri, Texas, North Carolina, Illinois and Pennsylvania. A delegation of a dozen Nissan workers even came from Brazil, to support United Automobile Workers (UAW) activists who have faced illegal retaliation in a 13-year struggle to unionize the Japanese giant’s 5,000 workers in Mississippi.\n\n“I feel their pain because we have been through the same thing with Mercedes,” said Kirk Garner of Vance, Alabama, who has been part of the decade-long UAW effort to unionize there.\n\nTwo weeks after the defeat of the Machinists Union at Boeing in South Carolina, an estimated 5,000 southern union activists gathered in Canton to lay the foundation of what they hope will be the large-scale community movements necessary to defeat anti-union forces nationwide – and in the White House.\n\nCommunity support is proving essential for union drives, as companies use politicians and expensive media buys to counter such campaigns. In South Carolina, Boeing spent $485,000 on TV ads and politicians warned that a successful union drive would discourage other companies from moving to the region. In 2014, anti-union forces used a similar strategy to defeat a high-profile attempt to unionize Volkswagen in Chattanooga.\n\nIn Mississippi, as the UAW seeks a vote, Nissan has begun airing its own anti-union ads this week. The UAW claims that the company has told staff that if they unionize, the plant will move to Mexico. The company has denied the charge.\n\nIn an email to the Guardian on Sunday, the Nissan corporate communications manager Parul Bajaj said “the allegations made by the union are totally false” and accused the UAW of a “campaign to pressure the company into recognizing a union, even without employee support”.\n\nHigh-profile company ad campaigns can turn communities against unions. Workers often face not just intimidation from their bosses but also peer pressure from friends and neighbors, who warn of harm to the local economy.\n\n“I don’t think the pressure was as intense as it is now,” said GM worker John W Hill Jr, who was part of the first successful UAW effort to unionize at a GM plant in Monroe, Louisiana 41 years ago.\n\n“In 1976, there wasn’t the harsh anti-union sentiment that is so prevalent over the country right now … We didn’t have all the politicians and everybody against us.\n\n“I hope whenever the [Nissan] election is that they vote yes. But deep down inside, I think there is so much fear here and disconnect that I just don’t think [they will].”\n\nHill was interrupted by a Nissan worker with a toddler on his shoulders: “Nah, man, we got this, we got this. We are gonna beat them.”\n\nAs they marched on the plant on an unusually warm March day, workers sang: “We are ready, we are ready, we are ready, Nissan.”\n\nThey have organized a community coalition, the Mississippi Alliance for Fairness at Nissan, that includes #BlackLivesMatter activists, church groups, the Sierra Club, the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. The coalition is calling for a mobilization not seen in the south since the civil rights movement of the 1960s.\n\nMore than 80% of Nissan’s workers in Canton are black. A win at Nissan could be a game-changer. On Saturday, they had a guest speaker.\n\n“If we can win here at Nissan, you will give a tremendous bolt of confidence to working people all over this country,” Bernie Sanders told a crowd of 5,000. “If you can stand up to a powerful multinational corporation in Canton, Mississippi, workers all over this country will say, ‘We can do it, too.’”\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Bernie Sanders speaks at the March on Mississippi for workers’ rights in Canton. Photograph: Rogelio V. Solis/AP\n\n‘We know a union could help’\n\nOut of 43 of Nissan plants worldwide, 40 are unionized. The only plants that are not are the one in Canton, Mississippi and two in Tennessee. Workers say the lack of a union makes a difference. Bajaj said Nissan “respects and supports” employees’ decisions about who represents them.\n\nMany employees in Canton say they make less than $15 an hour, with starting wages for some at $13.46 an hour. Workers say they make $2 less each hour than those in Smyrna, where Nissan faces competition from unionized GM factories.\n\nBajaj countered that the company’s “hourly wages are significantly above the average central [Mississippi] production wage of $16.70 per hour”.\n\nMany Canton workers also say they are forced to work for years as temporary employees and complain that they are denied vacation, only allowed to take time off in the last week of June and the first week of July – when the plant shuts down.\n\nWithout a union, they say, workers are often forced to work in unsafe conditions. Since 2008, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha) has cited Canton facilities six times. In February, Osha issued a citation for a failure to have proper safety lights indicating when machines were on and for not instructing workers to turn off machines before fixing them.\n\n“I had to call [Osha] twice in the past month,” said Karen Camp, who works in the paint shop. “You couldn’t see 10ft in front of your face because of the ventilation problems. We know a union could help fix it.”\n\nIn his email, Bajaj said: “The safety and well-being of our employees is always our top priority. We dedicate extensive time and resources to safety programs and training at the plant.”\n\nThe Canton plant, she added, “has a safety record that is significantly better than the national average for automotive plants”, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nWorkers say Nissan has fought the union every step of the way. In 2015, the National Labor Relations Board charged that the company and its temporary employee agency provider, Kelly Services, violated workers’ rights, with one manager threatening to close the plant if it went union. Nissan has said it is defending against the charge.\n\nWorkers say the company routinely imposes one-on-one meetings, where they are questioned about their views on unionization and have their work histories reviewed. Some say those who support the union are routinely denied promotion. Others say pro-union workers have been unfairly let go.\n\nIn March 2014, a 43-year-old pro-UAW Nissan worker, Calvin Moore, who had worked in the plant since 2004, was fired. Many workers began to protest.\n\nThe actor Danny Glover, a supporter of Nissan workers who was also present at Saturday’s march, with NAACP president Cornell William Brooks, called a press conference to denounce the firing. Students from Jackson State and Tougaloo College engaged in civil disobedience at Nissan headquarters. Workers in Brazil organized protests in solidarity.\n\nThree months later, Moore was hired again. The win put wind in the union’s sails.\n\n“It bolstered people’s spirits,” Moore said on Saturday. “To be honest, people were happier for me than I was for myself.”\n\nMoore said community support and events, such as the March on Mississippi, were key to winning support among coworkers.\n\n“We have had a lot of non-union workers who have changed their mind about the UAW,” he said. “Events like this should help us get more support, especially when people see this on TV.”\n\n‘If there was ever a movement to be lead’\n\nHigh-profile labor efforts could prove crucial not just to unions in the coming months and years, but also to Democratic attempts to win back Congress and the White House. Last year, Donald Trump won the largest share of union voters for a Republican since 1984. He has since focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back to the US.\n\nHowever, with many of these new jobs being temporary, Democrats feel they can win union voters back by focusing on how to improve such jobs. Such a strategy, if successful, may not just to win back blue-collar voters. It could also help soften racial tensions that have spread among manufacturing workers.\n\nWith Republicans fighting unionization nationwide, the incoming Democratic National Committee chair, Tom Perez – who was labor secretary under Barack Obama – has signaled that he intends to focus on supporting efforts to unionize.\n\nIn Canton, workers said their efforts could provide a model for the progressive movement in the age of Trump.\n\n“If there was ever a movement to be led,” said Mississippi NAACP president Derrick Johnson, “it would be led out of Mississippi, because we have always lead the movement.”",
  "latent_2537": "The Justice Department sued Deutsche Bank AG, one of the world's 10 biggest banks by assets, on Tuesday for at least $1 billion for defrauding taxpayers by \"repeatedly\" lying to a federal agency when securing taxpayer-backed insurance for thousands of shoddy mortgages.\n\nMortgageIT, a subsidiary of Germany's largest lender, egregiously violated federal rules that came with government backing on more than 39,000 mortgages worth more than $5 billion since 1999, according to the lawsuit filed in Manhattan federal court.\n\nBy funneling risky mortgages to the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Federal Housing Administration, MortgageIT's loans were guaranteed with the full faith and credit of the U.S. government. A third of those mortgages, or about 12,500, have since defaulted, leaving the government on the hook.\n\nOn more than 3,100 of its FHA-guaranteed mortgages that have defaulted, HUD has paid more than $386 million in claims to the owners of the mortgage debt, according to the lawsuit. More than two-thirds of those mortgages defaulted within two years of origination.\n\nAs of February, more than 7,500 additional mortgages, with more than $888 million in unpaid principal balances, also had defaulted without HUD paying any claims. About half of those defaulted within the first two years.\n\nThe agency expects to pay \"at least hundreds of millions of dollars\" in additional claims as more risky mortgages default in the months and years ahead, according to the lawsuit.\n\nMeanwhile, Deutsche Bank made \"substantial profits\" by selling these loans to investors, the suit claims. Federal authorities identified some of the MortgageIT practices that now form the basis of its suit as far back as 2003. Despite warnings, the problems continued.\n\nThe Justice Department is seeking damages three times the amount HUD has already shelled out for defaulted mortgages with allegedly fraudulently-obtained government insurance, plus additional penalties for each mortgage that broke federal rules.\n\nWhile private investors have thus far faced a long, slow war battling lenders and connected Wall Street firms to buy back toxic mortgages investors claim were sold to them fraudulently, the government's suit is fairly straightforward. As part of the FHA program MortgageIT participated in, lenders are required to annually certify that they check basic records like borrowers' incomes, credit history and employment record. The lenders also are required to review loans that quickly default to guard against sloppy lending practices, and act in the government's best interests because taxpayers are bearing the risks for potentially poor loans.\n\nDeutsche did none of those things, according to the lawsuit.\n\nThe lender \"recklessly selected mortgages that violated program rules in blatant disregard of whether borrowers could make mortgage payments,\" the government claims. \"While Deutsche Bank and MortgageIT profited from the resale of these government-insured mortgages, thousands of American homeowners have faced default and eviction.\"\n\nDeutsche acquired MortgageIT for about $430 million in January 2007. At the time, Deutsche said MortgageIT was \"one of the fastest-growing and largest residential mortgage loan originators in the U.S.\" and would help the bank expand its mortgage securitization business.\n\nOn Tuesday, a Deutsche spokeswoman, Renee Calabro, said that \"close to 90 percent of the activity\" alleged in the lawsuit occurred prior to the bank's purchase of the lending unit.\n\n\"We believe the claims against MortgageIT and Deutsche Bank are unreasonable and unfair, and we intend to defend against the action vigorously,\" Calabro said in a statement.\n\nFrom 2007 through early 2009, Robert Khuzami, the current head of enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission, served as Deutsche's lawyer overseeing regulatory matters and investigations. He was not named in the Justice Department's suit.\n\nIn the suit, authorities spelled out a variety of alleged abuses that paint the Deutsche subsidiary as a reckless lender that employed minimal oversight over its operations. When alert employees raised concerns over violations, upper management, including the president of MortgageIT at the time, failed to act, the suit claims.\n\nThe firm's president knew there were problems with its loan underwriting as early as 2005, according to the lawsuit.\n\nUpper management at MortgageIT \"knowingly, wantonly, and recklessly permitted egregious underwriting violations to continue unabated,\" the lawsuit alleges. \"These failures caused the government millions of dollars in losses.\"\n\nIn one example of the firm's reckless attitude, an outside auditor’s reports that found \"serious underwriting violations\" at MortgageIT were “literally stuffed in a closet and left unread and unopened\" in 2004, according to the suit.\n\nThe firm should have had up to eight employees reviewing loans it peddled to FHA. Instead, it never employed more than one person, the suit claims. By the end of 2007, that one person was producing loans, instead of reviewing them.\n\nOn three separate occasions in 2003, 2004 and 2006 the firm was told by federal authorities to fix its deficient review practices. Each time, MortgageIT said it had complied. And each time, it lied, the suit claims.\n\nTwice in 2005, employees at the firm went to upper management to complain about poor underwriting practices. Management did nothing, the suit claims.\n\nThe lawsuit follows two separate reports this year by HUD's inspector general. In one, the internal watchdog faulted the agency for its poor oversight of FHA-approved lenders. In the other, it found that more than 49 percent of loans underwritten by FHA-approved lenders in a sample did not conform to the agency's requirements.",

Not wanting to be \"labelled\" with a psychiatric diagnosis. A very important reason why some people do not get assessed for ADHD is that they do not want to be labelled as having a psychiatric disorder due to the associated stigma. Thus, they shun having a formal diagnosis. Some may fear that somehow this information will become public knowledge or even made known to the company they work for. After checking with a leading psychiatrist in this field, let me assure you that this is certainly not the case. Moreover, with adults, it is usually not even necessary to make a formal diagnosis but rather to assess quantitatively the problematical behaviours e.g. distractibility, emotional dysregulation etc.\n\nA very important reason why some people do not get assessed for ADHD is that they do not want to be labelled as having a psychiatric disorder due to the associated stigma.

Symptoms of ADHD obscured by symptoms of more common disorders . Sometimes ADHD goes unrecognized by both the individuals with ADHD and the professionals who are providing treatment. This can happen because symptoms are obscured by a variety of conditions that often accompany ADHD e.g. anxiety disorders, addictions, and/or bipolar disorder . This can lead to treatment that addresses these conditions ignores the underlying main cause. Problems contributed by ADHD such as not getting projects done on time at work may actually be causing the anxiety. Quite often adults come for an assessment only after a child of theirs has been diagnosed with ADHD thereby crystalizing the realization for the adult that they too have similar problems as their child.\n\nSometimes ADHD goes unrecognized by both the individuals with ADHD and the professionals who are providing treatment.

Research on adult ADHD has become much more intense over the past 20 years and there are now questionnaires which have been standardized using huge samples from the population. Standardized test such as the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale (Conners et al 1999) or the more current Barkley Adult ADHD Rating Scale-IV (Barkley 2011) are widely used. The Conners questionnaire contains \" Observer \" forms meant for the family and friends of the person suspected of having ADHD.\n\nThis is very important because a person with ADHD may not realize the extent of their behavioural difficulties. It can be a revelation to them to have the perspective of these other important people in their lives. Obtaining such information can be useful in decreasing marital/couple stress that can be severe for both parties.\n\nThe Barkley questionnaire has a feature not offered by the Connors in that it measures a potential new type of ADHD (Becker et al, 2014) called Sluggish Cognitive Tempo (SCT) . SCT is characterized by several intriguing new symptoms one of which is dreaminess . These are not included in previous assessments but can be associated with ADHD. Having incorporated SCT, the Barkley questionnaire may prove useful for assessing someone who may have ADHD but did not meet the previous assessment criteria for ADHD.\n\nImproved assessment information, specifically of one's strengths and weaknesses means that the clinician can provide much more specific treatment strategies for each particular client.\n\nResearch on adult ADHD has become much more intense over the past 20 years and there are now questionnaires which have been standardized using huge samples from the population.

Improved treatment modalities . Through years of studies and research, there is now an increased variety of effective treatments. A therapist is able to select a treatment most suited to the characteristics and preferences of the person with ADHD. Here is a list of just some of the possible approaches to helping persons with ADHD: Psychoeducation . Gaining knowledge of the kinds of problems that someone with ADHD are particularly vulnerable to e.g. addictions, difficulties in intimate relationships, anxiety and mood disorders. Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). CBT is helpful in teaching a variety of coping skills e.g. how to regulate excessive emotions; how to be patient e.g. waiting for the other person to finish speaking before replying. Interpersonal, family oriented approaches Mindfulness meditation for training the brain/mind so that the person is better able to manage symptoms such as distractibility. Mindfulness meditation designed for increasing self-compassion can be especially helpful for individuals with the low self-esteem which often accompanies ADHD. Support groups and self-help groups . These groups are specifically created to help anyone with ADHD and provide informational, practical, and emotional support. Such groups are at least as effective as individual psychotherapy in helping individuals feel better about themselves , attain life goals and dreams, and live fulfilling lives. Electronic gadgets and Mobile Apps can help the person with ADHD better organize and manage his/her life or provide mental exercises the person can perform when the condition is particularly bad. e.g. electronic organizers, digital recorders, and a great variety of apps for smart phones are now available although none has been certified or studied sufficiently . Medication . Approximately 2/3 of adults with ADHD can improve their ability to stay focussed through taking appropriate medications. A formal diagnosis of ADHD which can be obtained from a psychiatrist is required in order to get these prescription medications for ADHD.\n\nThrough years of studies and research, there is now an increased variety of effective treatments.

  "latent_2614": "Another e-mail from the Hillary Clinton secret server may have the Democratic front-runner in hot water — and this one’s not even classified. The Associated Press reported last night that then-Secretary of State Clinton intervened to benefit her son-in-law’s business prospects. Marc Mezvinsky was asked by an investor to get help setting up contacts at the State Department, and Hillary ordered her deputy to work on it:\n\nAs secretary of state, Hillary Clinton intervened in a request forwarded by her son-in-law on behalf of a deep-sea mining firm to meet with her or other State Department officials after one of the firm’s investors asked Chelsea Clinton’s husband for help setting up such contacts, according to the most recently released Clinton emails. The lobbying effort on behalf of Neptune Minerals Inc. came while Clinton — now the leading Democratic presidential candidate — was advocating for an Obama administration push to win Senate approval for a sweeping Law of the Sea Treaty. The pact would have aided U.S. mining companies scouring for minerals in international waters, but the Republican-dominated Senate blocked it. Clinton ordered a senior State Department official in August 2012 to look into the request. Her action came three months after an investor in the mining firm emailed Marc Mezvinsky, Chelsea Clinton’s husband and a partner in Eaglevale Partners LP, a New York hedge fund, asking for his help in setting up State Department contacts. Clinton relayed a copy of the investor’s email to Thomas Nides, then a deputy secretary of state and now vice chairman at Morgan Stanley, a major New York financial services firm. “Could you have someone follow up on this request, which was forwarded to me?” Clinton asked Nides. He replied: “I’ll get on it.”\n\nThe Associated Press has been asking Team Clinton for an answer on this for more than a week, but finally gave up and ran the story without their comment. They didn’t get any farther with the investor, Henry Siklas, or with a Neptune exec. Neither Chelsea Clinton nor her husband Mezvinsky would comment for the record, either. No one seems to want to talk about how a number of people — including Hillary herself — may have tried to cash in on her connection to power.\n\nAll of this circles around the Law of the Sea Treaty (LOST), which got blocked in July 2012, thanks to conservative opposition to its ratification. At the time, Jim DeMint of the Heritage Foundation actively organized opposition to the treaty, explaining that it would surrender sovereignty in areas including the mining interests that wanted Mezvinsky to use his family connections to curry favor at State:\n\nBy its current terms, the Law of the Sea Convention encompasses economic and technology interests in the deep sea, redistribution of wealth from developed to undeveloped nations, freedom of navigation in the deep sea and exclusive economic zones which may impact maritime security, and environmental regulation over virtually all sources of pollution. To effect the treaty’s broad regime of governance, we are particularly concerned that United States sovereignty could be subjugated in many areas to a supranational government that is chartered by the United Nations under the 1982 Convention. Further, we are troubled that compulsory dispute resolution could pertain to public and private activities including law enforcement, maritime security, business operations, and nonmilitary activities performed aboard military vessels.\n\nA month earlier, he went into more detail:\n\nRatifying LOST not only means losing national sovereignty, it means losing jobs. If the United States enters this agreement, it would mean giving up billions in oil-and-gas royalties to be redistributed among developing and landlocked nations — some of whom are state sponsors of terror — and subjecting the United States to international climate change lawsuits. … Although the treaty is meant to establish a set of rules regarding the oceans, only a few pages of it deal with purely navigational concerns. The bulk of the 288-page treaty does things like establish a new international bureaucracy in Jamaica to collect and redistribute royalties on offshore oil drilling and force the United States into international arbitration for environmental disputes. During a recent Senate hearing, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked how LOST would regulate American carbon emissions. Clinton claimed it wouldn’t, but she didn’t appear to consider several portions of the treaty that condemn and place sanctions on pollution — even those coming from land-based sources.\n\nWhen Hillary sent this request to her deputy, LOST had already foundered in the Senate. When Mezvinsky made his initial inquiries, though, ratification was still a possibility, and Hillary was pushing for its ratification. The investor in this mining operation saw the writing on the wall if LOST passed, and was looking to start drilling where it really mattered — in the halls of power. And Siklas appears to have struck oil, too.\n\nEveryone has clammed up, but perhaps this might be worth a look from a Congressional committee. Or perhaps some of the journalists covering the Hillary Clinton campaign can follow up on the AP’s fine work here and ask those questions in public. Did Hillary run the State Department on behalf of the American people, or as a cash cow for the Clintons?",

  "latent_3003": "Financial services networks wield great power across the planet but they are also peppered with points of vulnerability and tend to exclude many people who don't have access to bank accounts. The complete circumvention of these factors is what makes the Bitcoin network so interesting and unique.\n\nMasterCard has been doing its best to address issues like financial inclusion with lots of innovation in places like Africa. And of course like all card providers, it is engaged in a running battle to keep fraud on the network to a minimum.\n\nIBTimes asked Ann Cairns, president of international markets for MasterCard for her views about the vision of seamless, global financial integrity promised by a system like Bitcoin.\n\nShe said: \"Bitcoin in its current incarnation is slow in the sense of being able to do a transaction and have it properly authenticated, which can take quite a few minutes.\n\n\"It doesn't really work in today's fast paced shopping environment; even more so in train stations and so on when you have got millions of people trying to go through turn-styles – there you need real time, instantaneous authentication and delivery.\n\nCairns said digital currency will certainly be part of the ecosystem. \"I mean you already have them in various countries around the world, Mint in Canada for instance - that's a regulated currency.\n\n\"Once you start moving money around in significant tranches, I don't see that the world's financial systems will allow that to continue unregulated. It would be difficult for economies to run themselves, if that was the case.\n\n\"In terms of regulation, in terms of law and order, in terms of the way people run their economy on any massive scale - Bitcoin will have to evolve and change in order to have massive global adoption.\n\n\"I think blockchain is something that everybody is looking at around the world whether it's banks, whether it's the network - certainly it could have a very interesting future. But it's not the panacea right now.\n\nIn terms of have a seamless, global system, Cairns argued the card network can do that today.\n\n\"Your card will work at 38 million places on the planet - there's two billion people using the card network in that way.\"\n\nShe pointed out that Apple has decided to use the card network as rails to make payments for that reason.\n\n\"We are already ubiqitous; we are already connected to 27,000 banks. It's been digital from the get-go and it's physical as well. And it works with all sorts of devices.\n\n\"So here's something that's already built that's a huge layer of very safe, very secure, very easy, instantaneous way of moving money around the world.\n\n\"It takes two blinks of an eye to move a transaction from one side of the globe to the other through our network. That's real speed and is really difficult for anyone to replicate.\n\nShe also pointed to the added benefit that comes from handling so much data: \"When did the transaction occur? What was actually bought? So that you can do all sorts of reconciliation.\n\n\"If I buy something that I want to return, if I didn't have all of that data with the thing that I bought that would become that much more complicated.\"\n\nShe said the big data capabilities brought about by the network constitute an expanding field in economics.\n\n\"In fact our information is so good and so real time that it can indicate to governments in different countries - this is how your economy is going.\"\n\nSecurity is one aspect of public blockchains that has proved to be 100% robust to date. Meanwhile, identity fraud is a big deal for card providers; mitigating it is a cost that ultimately gets passed on to users in the form of transaction fees.\n\nCairns said: \"If you do a transaction over email it's not very secure. It's un-encrypted, it goes out into the ether sort of free and people can read it and so on, which is becoming quite a big issue now for many people.\n\nTo address this problem MasterCard has created a new technology which is called MDES - MasterCard digital enablement services. This system of tokenisation retains your 16 digit card credentials in a container and sends an encrypted version of them instead.\n\n\"Once that starts to be used ubiquitously that will be a very simple and easy thing to do. At this stage, it's just starting to happen; the banks are starting to adopt it, the merchants are starting to adopt it.\n\nCairns pointed out to IBTimes that there isn't a \"considerable amount of fraud\" on credit card transactions. \"It's a very low percentage,\" she said. \"But you want to get it to be absolutely minimal.\"\n\nOther measures being rolled out include special safety nets across whole countries. These pattern recognition checks look for things recurring that can be picked up, then the system can stop transactions being processed.\n\n\"Our safety nets kind of bounce fraudulent transactions in an incredible way actually, in terms of really being able to connect up all the banks and consumers together and pick up anything that we think looks incorrect.\n\nAnother approach which has just been announced is selfie technology, part of MasterCard Identity Check suite of solutions.\n\n\"You can start authenticating yourself through your face. Obviously you use your thumbprints to use your Apple iPhone and authenticate payments.\n\n\"We are also working with wristband developer in Canada called Nymia and this wristband actually measures your ECG, your heart.\n\n\"It's like reading your iris or your thumbprint but in this case it continually authenticates you.\n\n\"With this persistent authentication you don't even have to do anything, you have got this wrist band on and when you make a payment you can just communicate with a terminal or something and say that's me.\"\n\nShe concluded: \"We look at everything in our labs. One thing that I would say is we are not discounting any new technology.\"",

Before the protest, Hayward's stand-in had apologised for the BP chief executive's absence, saying: \"He is genuinely sorry he couldn't be here, especially with so many friends in the conference. But his schedule is under incredible pressure at the moment.\"\n\nSpeaking after they had been ejected from the conference, Swan told the Guardian that she and Gibson had gone ahead with the protest despite Hayward's no-show as it was a chance to address the oil industry.\n\n\"We wanted to use the opportunity to speak to BP and push it to change things. BP shouldn't be drilling in deep water and it shouldn't extract oil from the Canadian tar sands.\"\n\nSwan studied in Louisiana for four years, and was very concerned about the environmental and economic damage caused by the oil spill.\n\n\"It looks like irreparable damage has been done. People's lives will have been changed forever,\" Swan said.\n\nGibson said that BP was in \"severe trouble\" because it had not listened to activists in the past, and had instead pushed on with riskier projects.\n\n\"If they had heeded our advice over many years about the need to deliver genuine renewable energy sources, they would not be facing a $40bn (£24bn) disaster today,\" she said.\n\nHayward heading to Russia?\n\nWestwell, who arrived through the back entrance at The Grange St Paul's hotel to avoid journalists, insisted that BP's commitment to clean up the oil spill would last longer than the press interest in the story.\n\n\"When the media has left the Gulf and the headlines have gone elsewhere we will still be there helping,\" he said.\n\nWestwell said the company was now capturing up to 25,000 barrels a day in the Gulf of Mexico and described the financial consequences of the spill as severe, but reiterated BP would come through it.\n\nSo far, BP has spent $2bn fighting the spill and compensating victims since the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion on 20 April.\n\nHayward's non-appearance was the talk of the conference this morning.

  "latent_3329": "The handmade terracotta restoration of baby Jesus' head, on a statue outside the St Anne des Pins Catholic church in Ontario, has shocked parishioners and led to criticism of its creator, local artist Heather Wise.\n\nThe church’s priest, Gérard Lajeunesse, said the new head shocked parishioners when unveiled two weeks ago.\n\n“It really is shocking to the eyes because of the big contrast in colour,” he told the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.\n\nWebsite Sudbury.com reported that Ms Wise took it upon herself to answer the call of the church to repair the statue, after vandals stole the original head a year earlier.\n\n“I was so sad,” she said, describing her feeling after seeing the damaged statue.\n\n“My feelings were hurt when I saw it, because I thought, ‘Who would do that?’ It’s just not a positive feeling to see that. I said ‘I’m an artist, I would like to fix it.’”\n\nMs Wise, who learned to sculpt in college, said the alterations were only temporary and she planned to create a permanent head made of stone later this year.\n\n“To do a statue of baby Jesus for a church is like an honour of my entire art career,” she said.\n\n“I knocked on the door, talked to the priest and we’ve been getting this together, because we had to find out a way of doing it.”\n\nDespite understanding the concerns of his parishioners, Mr Lajeunesse praised Ms Wise for her eagerness to help.\n\n“It’s a first try. It’s a first go. And hopefully what is done at the end will please everyone,” he said.\n\n“She did this out of the goodness of her heart.”\n\nWhen confronted by how to handle the fallout from the situation, Mr Lajeunesse admitted “I wasn’t trained for this in seminary”.\n\nThe statue has been met with a mixed response on social media.\n\nSomeone left the cake out in the rain https://t.co/GS0v5MmMZg — Pauline Pantsdown (@PPantsdown) October 20, 2016\n\nArtists' restoration of Baby Jesus statue turns heads\n\n(Bears a striking resemblance to Maggie Simpson)https://t.co/JCYIGSjpHZ — J Wallis Martin (@J_Wallis_Martin) October 20, 2016\n\nThis was an actual attempt to restore a vandalized Baby Jesus statue in Canada, and it pretty much sums up how 2016 is going... pic.twitter.com/tnxSL21RHc — Tommy Tighe (@theghissilent) October 21, 2016",
  "latent_3550": "Zoe Saldana and Sam Worthington in Avatar\n\nAfter years of hype, loads of trailers and TV spots, and an unprecedented pre-release teaser screening in more than 100 theaters, James Cameron’s Avatar opens next Friday with a single question hanging in the air: What in the hell is going on with the blue cat people? At the blog Overthinking It, the poster “fenzel” speaks for much of the Comic-Con crowd in arguing that “ Avatar is going to suck” because “[c]ats with human boobs suck.” Drew Magary of Deadspin opines that the blue-aliens-riding-dragons flick could be the longest, biggest flop ever. And after attending an “Avatar Day” preview, Slate’s Daniel Engber wrote that while the “3-D effects do look pretty darn good,” the film’s CGI scenes bear an unfortunate and uncanny resemblance to the Jar Jar Binks-era Star Wars movies.\n\nExecutives at Fox shouldn’t break out the cyanide just yet. The movie is apparently getting Golden Globes buzz, and Harry Knowles Ain’t It Cool News is a big fan. (Then again, Harry Knowles is a big fan of everything.) So, will Avatar be a blockbuster or a flop—a blue-cat Star Wars or a blue-cat Battlefield Earth?\n\nMy money’s on blockbuster. Supporting evidence for the cat-people-as-cash-cow theory can be found on the Hollywood Stock Exchange. As of Thursday evening, Avatar is trading at 187.09 on HSX, a prediction market that Anita Elberse, an associate professor at Harvard Business School, says has a proven track record of prognosticating box-office revenues. That 187.09 figure means HSX traders believe the movie will make close to $187 million in its first four weeks of domestic release—a figure that would put the movie well on its way to profitability.\n\nIn addition to online betting markets, search-engine traffic also provides a glimpse at a movie’s earning potential. In a paper (PDF) published earlier this year, Duncan J. Watts and his team at Yahoo Research wrote that “search activity alone is indicative of box-office revenue, and remains so even weeks in advance of a movie’s release.” Asked to do a quick-and-dirty analysis of Avatar’s prospects, Watts says his models—which don’t consider factors like Avatar’s opening on IMAX screens and the size of the film’s marketing blitz—predict a $65 million to $84 million first-weekend gross. He notes that search volume for Avatar at this stage—one week before release—is about the same as the count for Wolverine, a movie that earned $87 million on its opening weekend.\n\nThe Yahoo Research numbers track with what traditional analysts are saying. On Wednesday, Jeffrey Wells of Hollywood Elsewhere quoted a box-office seer who believes Avatar will make about $70 million on its opening weekend—right around what Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King took in back in 2003. For Wells, the question is whether the film will be a hit or a mega-hit. “Who isn’t going to want to see this film? No one.” he writes. “But how many will want to see twice or thrice? That’s the question.” Variety’s David Cohen agrees, telling me that while the movie “could lose money for the studio” because of its huge budget, “it’s almost inconceivable that Avatar would be an all-out bomb.”\n\nBlockbusterdom can be a self-fulfilling prophecy. The studios select the properties they deem the most promising, then promote them with ginormous advertising campaigns and open them on the most-lucrative opening weekends. Avatar, which arrives on Dec. 18, will surely benefit from holiday moviegoing practices. Movies that open around Christmas tend to have a higher “multiple”—that is, a larger final gross as compared to the opening-weekend take—than non-Yuletide releases. Even a smaller-than-expected opening weekend for Avatar, then, could balloon into mega-dollars by New Year’s Day as a bored populace struggles to fill time on a week off from work.\n\nThe movie’s three-dimensionality should also help its cash flow. Avatar, the first live-action blockbuster of the present 3-D age, should open on about 2,500 3-D screens in the United States. Thanks to the 30 percent to 40 percent premium on tickets to 3-D movies, that extra dimension will do wonders for Avatar’s bottom line. Curiosity should also benefit the blue cats. Variety’s Cohen, who’s writing a book on 3-D, says that while animated titles have done the bulk of 3-D business, Journey to the Center of the Earth and Beowulf both made more money than their opening weekend grosses seemed to predict. “Journey was a little kids’ movie with a modest budget that went a long way toward proving that there’s a huge consumer demand for these pictures,” he says.\n\nEven if the feline humanoids don’t wow American audiences, Avatar should still print money overseas. Judging by recent history, the movie’sdomestic take will play a smallish role in its ultimate profitability. 2012 has made 78 percent of its total gross—more than $500 million—via international ticket sales. Foreign audiences have traditionally loved Cameronian spectacle— Terminator 2, True Lies, and Titanic all made more than 60 percent of their lifetime gross overseas. The world-at-large also appears smitten with 3-D. Consider Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs, which made $200 million at home and close to $700 million abroad. Avatar will debut on more than 16,000 screens internationally, with many locales building up 3-D infrastructure specifically for Avatar. Bring on the pesos and yuan.\n\nIf you’re looking for indicators of floppery, consider that Avatar is an original story. Of the 50 highest-grossing films of the decade, Hancock and The Day After Tomorrow are the only live-action movies that are not either sequels or based on existing properties. * Cameron isn’t telling some avant-garde story, though. Avatar, a sci-fi action flick with romantic elements, fills in pretty much every box on the blockbuster checklist.\n\nThe one weak point here may be the romance angle. Avatar will need repeat business to be a true smash. Obviously, most of that will depend on whether the movie is any good. It will also require, though, that Avatar appeal to women. In Titanic, Leonardo DiCaprio kissed Kate Winslet. In Avatar, Sam Worthington smooches a cat lady. An industry analyst who’s seen the studio tracking data tells me that the XX crowd has yet to cotton to the latter image. Compare that to Sherlock Holmes, coming out on Christmas Day, which appears to be a true four-quadrant picture, appealing to under-25 men, over-25 men, under-25 women, and over-25 women.\n\nWhich leads to one final Avatar question: Is it too late to make all the cat girls look like Kate Winslet?\n\nCorrection, Dec. 11, 2009: This piece originally said that of “the 50 highest-grossing films of the decade, Hancock is the only live-action movie that’s not either a sequel or based on an existing property.” The Day After Tomorrow also meets those specifications.

  "latent_3665": "Tesla’s acquisition of German engineering group Grohmann hasn’t gone entirely smooth, evident by the dust-up between Elon Musk and the former head of Grohmann. Reports emerged last month that Grohmann was ordered to drop all clients to focus entirely on Model 3. Now, it seems those other legacy clients—namely BMW, Bosch and Daimler—weren’t made aware of that decision ahead of time. And they’re still expecting work to be completed by Grohmann.\n\n“Of course, we expect suppliers to fulfill their contracts and agreements,” a Daimler spokesperson told Jalopnik on Friday.\n\nThe automaker declined to comment further, but BMW told Reuters that it also believed “Grohamnn will honor its contractual obligations toward us” and said it had not been formally notified about any changes to its contract.\n\nThe decision to focus entirely on Tesla projects led to the recent dismissal of Grohmann’s head, Klaus Grohmann, who reportedly disagreed with how Musk wanted to treat the company’s existing clients. Ultimately, Musk got his way—and Grohmann left the company.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Tesla spokesperson said, without much elaboration, that it’s working on to addressing the situation. “We have been in contact with every client for weeks on this issue and are on the way to finding individual solutions with each of them,” the spokesperson told Jalopnik.\n\nMusk has made an effort to quell any unrest at the Grohmann factory, offering workers a pay increase after concerns were raised about the decision to drop all existing clients.\n\nThe German workforce threatened to call a strike, backed by the IG Metall union, but the company said the situation shouldn’t impact its July production launch for the Model 3 Sedan.",
  "latent_3727": "Marco Rubio won the Minnesota caucus on Tuesday evening, giving him a lifeline in his long-shot bid to stop Donald Trump from claiming the Republican nomination. The victory will strengthen Rubio's argument that conservatives should rally around him instead of Ted Cruz.\n\nBut Rubio has two big problems standing between him and the Republican nomination. One is Trump's commanding lead in other states. Minnesota is Rubio's first win of the primary season, whereas Trump will have close to a dozen wins under his belt by the end of the night. If Rubio is going to wrest the nomination away from Trump, he's going to have to start actually winning a lot more states.\n\nRubio's other big problem is Ted Cruz. The Texas senator has already won contests in Iowa, Texas, and Oklahoma. Rubio has been arguing for weeks that he's the best choice to lead a united conservative movement against Donald Trump, but it's hard to see why Cruz should get out of Rubio's way instead of vice versa.\n\nMinnesota is Rubio's only win so far\n\nFor weeks, the media has portrayed Marco Rubio as the most potent threat to Donald Trump. But the election results so far haven't borne this out. Ted Cruz dealt Donald Trump his first defeat a month ago in Iowa. Then this evening Cruz won two more states — Texas and Oklahoma.\n\nTo be sure, Super Tuesday featured a lot of Southern states where Cruz can be expected to do well. But the race also featured states like Massachusetts, Vermont, and Virginia that should have been Marco Rubio territory. Yet Rubio fell short in Virginia and may wind up finishing behind John Kasich in both Massachusetts and Vermont.\n\nRubio's challenge, then, is to figure out how he can replicate his Minnesota win elsewhere in the country. Right now it seems like Rubio is losing — not only to Trump but to Cruz as well — and he doesn't even seem to know it.",
  "latent_3746": "Haven’t we all learned our lesson?\n\nWhen the “Invasion Attack” card was announced, it was met with nearly universal disappointment. Nakamura/Tanahashi again? Ishii/Naito again? No Okada singles match?\n\nYou won’t be finding anyone complaining about the card now.\n\nAs modern New Japan is prone to do, when we scratch our heads and question the direction, we always end up looking like fools. Ishii/Naito was a brilliant match that will end up a sure fire MOTY contender. Nakamura/Tanahashi was a masterful performance by both men that was completely different than any match they’ve ever had against one another. And the Okada tag match ended up being nothing more than a set up for a fantastic angle.\n\nThe rest of the card delivered, too. The opening match junior tag title bout was the best opener I can recall during this current hot run. Taguchi/Devitt was a very good match leading to a Devitt face turn, one year to the day of his heel turn. Guns & Gallows had their best match yet as a team in the semi final IWGP Heavyweight Tag Title bout.\n\nThree major angles, two title changes, and two sure fire MOTY contenders. This was a brilliant show, both aesthetically and with long term booking that all peaked at once, sending a number of major players in drastically new directions.\n\nThe show we all hated a week ago has a very good shot at ending up as the best show of the year. New Japan proves us wrong, again. What else is new?\n\n1. IWGP Jr. Heavyweight Tag Team Title: Matt Jackson & Nick Jackson (c) vs. Kota Ibushi & El Desperado – This was the best junior tag in a long time, and easily the best Bucks match in New Japan. Desperado was Ricky Morton early as the Bucks creatively were cutting off tags. Ibushi’s hot tag was indeed hot, as he cleaned house in impressive fashion. Ibushi was on his game in this bout.\n\nDesperado did his big tope where he ends up in the 15th row, and Kota hit his standing SSP, but every time Ibushi was on the verge of putting the champs away, the Bucks would pull out a new creative superkick counter. The finishing stretch was fast paced and crisp, with a bunch of super close near falls that worked like a charm since this was considered a 50/50 match coming in. The Bucks hit a great looking springboard spike tombstone for a two count that got a big pop as people bought it as the finish. They hit the More Bang For Your Buck on Desperado to finally end it. They didn’t tease any tension between Ibushi & Desperado this time. Great match, seek it out. ****\n\n2. Special 6 Man Tag Match: Togi Makabe, Yuji Nagata & Kazushi Sakuraba vs. Minoru Suzuki, TAKA Michinoku & Taichi – The Makabe bump count for this one was zero. He is the best in the world at doing virtually nothing in these throw away multiple man tag matches. He hit some lariats early, tagged out, and was never seen again. Saku was useless, as per the usual. Suzuki & Nagata had some decent strike exchanges. For the finish, Nagata & Saku used double arm bars on the juniors while Makabe “brawled” (hugged it out) with Suzuki on the floor. Nothing to see here. **1/4\n\n3. NWA World Tag Team Title: Rob Conway & Jax Dane (c) vs. Hiroyoshi Tenzan & Satoshi Kojima – Bruce Tharpe. What an amazing man. He was in rare form here. Conway was working hard, selling his ass off and bumping around. Tenzan sold for a long time, which is probably a bad idea, but he’s no better cleaning house on a hot tag these days, so it’s no win. Kojima looked real good. Tharpe hopped on the apron to break up a Tenzan Calf Branding attempt. Kojima chased him off, hit a big lariat on Dane, and Tenzan hit the moonsault to finish him off. New champs. Kojima now holds the NWA World Heavyweight & NWA World Tag Team titles. He challenged Tully for the TV title after the match. **1/4\n\n4. Wrestling vs. Jiu-jitsu MMA Fight: Toru Yano & Takashi Iizuka vs. Daniel Gracie & Rolles Gracie – This was roughly a million times better than the Gracie’s Wrestle Kingdom bout. They worked a wild brawl with the heels controlling 95% of it. For the finish Iizuka missed his iron glove attack on Daniel and nailed Yano. Daniel then used a leglock for the tap. It was by no means good, but the crowd was into all of this, so what do I know? **\n\n5. Special Singles Match: Ryusuke Taguchi vs. Prince Devitt – Devitt was in body paint again, and came down wearing a dark cloak. Taguchi is doing a full blown Eddie Guerrero act, with the same gear, mannerisms, and even the three amigos move. The Young Bucks were at ringside, but Devitt was refusing their help early. After arguing several times, the Bucks attacked him. Devitt cleaned house on them to a big pop. He worked the rest of the match clean with his old babyface style, including his big somersault suicide senton that he never uses as a heel. That was symbolic. Taguchi was kicking out of everything. Bloody Sunday, top rope double stomp, brainbuster. Devitt survived two Dodon’s, but a third fireman’s carry variation put him away. Devitt offered a handshake post match. In the interview area, Devitt didn’t speak. Taguchi said the Devitt must leave stip was unofficial. At minimum, Devitt has left Bullet Club & turned face. Maybe Apollo 55 reforms and goes after The Bucks titles. ***1/4\n\nIntermission\n\n6. Kazuchika Okada & YOSHI-HASHI vs. Bad Luck Fale & Tama Tonga – Short, tidy, nothing match, with a few minutes of YOSHI selling, one hot tag, Fale bullying Okada a bit, and Okada hitting the Rainmaker on Tonga for the win. Fale went nose to nose with Okada post match, but it was a set up for AJ STYLES to attack the champ. He delivered a Styles Clash, called him a TNA young boy, challenged for the title, and revealed a Bullet Club shirt. This came across great, and the match should be crazy awesome. Fale was a red herring, and the lesson here is to never doubt the booking genius of Gedo & Jado. When it comes to New Japan these days, you truly have to let it play out. *1/4, ***** for the angle.\n\n7. NEVER Openweight Title: Tomohiro Ishii (c) vs. Tetsuya Naito – Ishii won with a brainbuster in a match that was as good as anything this year, and will top many a match of the year list. Just brilliant work all around again from these two, in a match completely different from the first two bouts between them. This is the best feud in wrestling, and these guys are now having a series of matches that rivals anything in wrestling over the last few years, including Tanahashi/Okada. The feud is hitting on multiple layers, and once again displays the booking prowess of Gedo & Jado, with the NEVER title has been elevated, Ishii now established as a player, and Naito being rehabbed after losing some luster with the big push last year that nobody wanted (yet). This rivalry is pro wrestling at its absolute best. The match itself was just a tad too short for the full five, but this was every bit as good as the first bout and probably better if you put a gun to my head and forced me to choose. ****3/4\n\n8. IWGP Tag Team Title: Karl Anderson & Doc Gallows (c) vs. Hirooki Goto & Katsuyori Shibata – Good match, thanks to a hot finishing stretch, and maybe the best Guns & Gallows match yet. Started slow with a parade of chin locks from the heels that would make Randy Orton blush. Was really a nothing match until the closing stretch, which is an area where Anderson always excels. Anderson hit a Gun Stun out of nowhere on Goto, and then the champs hit the Magic Killer for the win. You had to figure they would retain, after losing a non title match, and also both singled matches head to head at New Japan Cup. ***\n\n9. IWGP Intercontinental Title: Hiroshi Tanahashi (c) vs. Shinsuke Nakamura – Brilliant work by both men. Tanahashi worked subtle heel, which he is so good at, it makes me want to see a full fledged heel run out of him. His facials & mannerisms are so natural, you’d think he was heeling it up for years, and the crowd ate it up. Is there anything this guy can’t do? Look, if you watch this match and don’t dig this performance, you’re just being stubborn at this point. He’s an all time great, and as great as Tanahashi was here, Nakamura may have been even better.\n\nTanahashi murdered the left knee, in an effort to take out the knee strikes and Boma Ye.\n\nNakamura sold the damage like like he was being pounded with a hammer, and essentially never had control of the match until the very end, when after having a Boma Ye attempt blocked, he used the right knee to hit one and win the title back. A simple story, told by two of the best on the planet. Tanahashi adds another classic to his resume, which is already in rare territory of all time greats and constantly growing. Daniel Gracie challenged Nak post match, and Sakuraba came out as well. Looked like a tag match was being set up. Whoa boy, Nak has his work cut out for him with those three stiffs. This potentially scary angle was the only black mark of the night. ****1/2\n\nI keep using the word “brilliant”, and here it comes again. I keep being amazed by the brilliant booking of Gedo & Jado, who are so far ahead of anybody else in the world that they lap the field multiple times. Creatively, they can not be touched, and this three year run of both long & short term stories rivals anything else, ever, in terms of elevating titles, elevating new stars, and keeping things interesting. If business continues to grow, and New Japan can approach or reach their past business peaks, I think we have to start seriously talking about this booking team as potential Wrestling Observer Hall of Famers.\n\nSpecial thanks to @SenorLARIATO for his fantastic gif work.

  "latent_3796": "Invisible algorithms increasingly shape the world we live in, and not always for the better. Unfortunately, few mechanisms are in place to ensure they’re not causing more harm than good.\n\nThat might finally be changing: A first-in-the-nation bill, passed yesterday in New York City, offers a way to help ensure the computer codes that governments use to make decisions are serving justice rather than inequality.\n\nComputer algorithms are a series of steps or instructions designed to perform a specific task or solve a particular problem. Algorithms inform decisions that affect many aspects of society. These days, they can determine which school a child can attend, whether a person will be offered credit from a bank, what products are advertised to consumer, and whether someone will receive an interview for a job. Government officials also use them to predict where crimes will take place, who is likely to commit a crime and whether someone should be allowed out of jail on bail.\n\nAlgorithms are often presumed to be objective, infallible, and unbiased. In fact, they are highly vulnerable to human bias. And when algorithms are flawed, they can have serious consequences.\n\nJust recently, a highly controversial DNA testing technique used by New York City’s medical examiner put thousands of criminal cases in jeopardy. Flawed code can also further entrench systemic inequalities. The algorithms used in facial recognition technology, for example, have been shown to be less accurate on Black people, women, and juveniles, putting innocent people at risk of being labeled crime suspects. And a ProPublica study has found that tools designed to determine the likelihood of future criminal activity made incorrect predictions that were biased against Black people. These tools are used to make bail and sentencing decisions, replicating the racism in the criminal justice system under a guise of technological neutrality.\n\nBut even when we know an algorithm is racist, it’s not so easy to understand why. That’s in part because algorithms are usually kept secret. In some cases, they are deemed proprietary by the companies that created them, who often fight tooth and nail to prevent the public from accessing the source code behind them. That secrecy makes it impossible to fix broken algorithms.\n\nThe New York City Council yesterday passed legislation that we are hopeful will move us toward addressing these problems. New York City already uses algorithms to help with a broad range of tasks: deciding who stays in and who gets out of jail, teacher evaluations, firefighting, identifying serious pregnancy complications, and much more. The NYPD also previously used an algorithm-fueled software program developed by Palantir Technologies that takes arrest records, license-plate scans, and other data, and then graphs that data to supposedly help reveal connections between people and even crimes. The department since developed its own software to perform a similar task.\n\nThe bill, which is expected to be signed by Mayor Bill de Blasio, will provide a greater understanding of how the city’s agencies use algorithms to deliver services while increasing transparency around them. This bill is the first in the nation to acknowledge the need for transparency when governments use algorithms and to consider how to assess whether their use results in biased outcomes and how negative impacts can be remedied.\n\nThe legislation will create a task force to review New York City agencies’ use of algorithms and the policy issues they implicate. The task force will be made up of experts on transparency, fairness, and staff from non-profits that work with people most likely to be harmed by flawed algorithms. It will develop a set of recommendations addressing when and how algorithms should be made public, how to assess whether they are biased, and the impact of such bias.\n\nThese are extremely thorny questions, and as a result, there are some things left unanswered in bill. It doesn’t spell out, for example, whether the task force will require all source code underlying algorithms to be made public or if disclosing source code will depend on the algorithm and its context. While we believe strongly that allowing outside researchers to examine and test algorithms is key to strengthening these systems, the task force is charged with the responsibility of recommending the right approach.\n\nSimilarly, the bill leaves it to the task force to determine when an algorithm disproportionately harms a particular group of New Yorkers — based upon race, religion, gender, or a number of other factors. Because experts continue to debate this difficult issue, rigorous and thoughtful work by the task force will be crucial to protecting New Yorkers’ rights.\n\nThe New York Civil Liberties Union testified in support of an earlier version of the bill in October, but we will be watching to see the exact makeup of the task force, what recommendations are advanced, and whether de Blasio acts on them. We will also be monitoring to make sure the task force gets all of the necessary details it needs from the agencies.\n\nAlgorithms are not inherently evil. They have the potential to greatly benefit us, and they are only likely to become more ubiquitous. But without transparency and a clear plan to address their flaws, they might do more harm than good.",

Yes we will.\"\n\nAttacking the rumours head on, Mr Alabbar said: \"There has been confusion and concern about how much Dubai owes and how its debt will be financed. Concern leads to speculation.

Our key sovereign assets at their current level of undervaluation stand at $90bn or AED350bn.\n\n\"This does not include our aiports, our bridges, our metro system or our healthcare. The total debt obligation of the government's affiliated companies is $70bn or AED256bn. This is compared to the total asset value of the affiliated companies of $260bn or AED950bn.\"\n\nHe added: \"When we started the work in 1992, the Council was hit by rumours. We ran from them and we have been running from constant rumours for 18 years. Still there are rumours that we're selling our property assets or selling 50pc of Emirates airline.

We've been running a long time and could probably do with a breather. We will use this time to learn lessons and become a stronger city.\"\n\nThe conference, the public sessions of which started today and has attracted hundred of top business bosses from around the world, was opened this morning by the head of the DIFC, His Excellency Omar Bin Sulaiman. The conference's title, \"Where money meets opportunity\", has been given a more sober sub-heading of \"Sustaining our oasis of prosperity in a turbulent world\".\n\nThe DIFC owns the emirate's financial assets such as its stock exchange, Mr Bin Sulaiman said: \"DIFC Week takes place at a critical juncture for the global economy. Many see in the turmoil of global markets a crisis of epochal proportions. Yet the financial shock waves rumbling around the world could be the first birth pangs of a new economic reality... Until recently capital typically moved from the developed world to developing economies. This dynamic is now changing.

  "latent_3858": "Zahra Noorbakhsh came out as bisexual shortly after the shooting at Pulse nightclub in Orlando last June. She did it in a very public way — on her podcast, #GoodMuslimBadMuslim. Below is an excerpt of an essay she wrote for Bitch Media called \"Coming out as bi when you're Muslim and married.\"\n\n... In “Secrets and Safety,” episode 19 of our podcast, #GoodMuslimBadMuslim, my cohost Taz Ahmed pointed out that some Muslims stood in solidarity with the queer community while simultaneously silencing the queer Muslims in their own mosques. It made me sick. Islam and queerness should not be at odds. There are rich communities of LGBTQ Muslims, but we’re often still seen as exceptions or rare cases. It felt important to me to come out both to counter the media coverage that set up Muslim people and LGBTQ people as two distinct groups that never overlap and to help change the homophobia I saw in a lot of Muslim communities. What I didn’t know was if I’d be shaking up any homophobia in my own family.\n\nAs my cohost shared her poem, “Secret Identities,” I couldn't bring myself to sit in silence. To do so felt like a homophobic act on my part. I could feel the heat in my neck and the tightness in my chest with every passing second that I said nothing. My head felt like it was boiling until it felt like my ears were going to pop off, and I couldn't take it anymore.\n\n“I’m bisexual,” I said into the microphone, “and I’m married to a man. That’s not an erasure....”\n\nThose were the thoughts I was able to piece together in the moment. As soon as I said it, I felt better. After we recorded, after our producer finished the final edits, after we launched it, after I remembered that my parents listen to the podcast, I felt sick again. I have never come out to my parents. Do I need to come out to my parents? I’m married. What do they care?\n\n“Is this necessary?” I asked my queer friends who I knew wouldn’t call me a coward to my face. I was so scared and expected that I’d get an answer like, “You’re not bisexual, you’re just not letting yourself be gay.” Or worse, that I would be seen as somehow usurping a queer identity as a woman married to a man, a woman who lives a straight-passing life, who is not “gay enough” to be queer. But I got none of those dismissive responses. What I got instead from friends and fans of the podcast alike was, “Zahra, coming out is so hard. I am sending you so much love right now. I wish I could give you a hug.” ...\n\nComedian Zahra Noorbakhsh is the co-host of the podcast #GoodMuslimBadMuslim.",

The purpose in these UEFIs is to give the respective boards some much needed attention and flexibility that Gigabyte themselves appear to have absolutely zero interest in doing. Make no mistake, these UEFIs exist because Gigabyte are doing a piss-poor job of supporting their AM4 boards.\n\nI DARE you to do better than me Gigabyte. Yes, I'm challenging you. What say you?\n\nDo you have a beef with Gigabyte?\n\nNo I don't. I do however believe any manufacturer needs to be held accountable and called out when they are doing an below average job. Constructive criticism is how everybody grows and becomes better. If you can't take criticism it's perhaps time to find another job. When I do call a manufacturer out it is never without cause. In the case of Gigabyte I've observed them and their customers for some time the levied criticisms are justified by proof I have accrued over the period of 2 years or so and substantiated by Gigabyte users and my own experiences when trying to open a dialog with Gigabyte to make them aware of whats happening. As a reviewer among many other things it is only responsible someone at least try to. If Gigabyte want to contact me they are most welcome to providing they actually listen and act upon what they say they will do.\n\nHow do you feel about Gigabyte Matt referring to you as a member of their community?\n\nInsulted. I went out of my way to not associate myself with Gigabyte in any way, shape, or form. That is why I am here on win-raid doing this and not their forums. I do not associate myself with anyone who thinks half arsing things is acceptable. Period.\n\nBut I don't have a problem with Gigabyte or anything they do!\n\nThats great, enjoy your Gigabyte product and be on your way. Just be aware and respect even if you personally do not agree that a great many people do have a problem with Gigabyte and a vast majority of that problem is Gigabyte not supporting their products properly and having extremely buggy software. Eg; OC Guru II I tried telling Gigabyte around 18 -24 months ago had a bug where the OSD did not work at all. They promised it would be fixed, it wasn't even when I checked six months later, and as far as I know still has not been fixed to this very day. Now things are exacerbating to the extent of UEFIs at least in the case of their AM4 boards are sorely lacking in features that every other manufacturer has no problem incorporating such as P-State overclocking and UEFI bugs that should be being caught in alpha or beta testing yet have persisted for numerous UEFI releases, it is sloppy work and not something anyone should tolerate.\n\nAre you releasing these UEFIs to put pressure on Gigabyte to do a better job?\n\nAbsolutely.\n\nAre you the same ket that made the Asus P5Q modified BIOSes?\n\nYes I am. I'm also the same person that made the modified vBIOS for some ATI cards that improved their performance with AA by 30% (claimed by others, not me. I just wanted to make something better) and the very same person who has released various modified drivers and so on.\n\nCan you mod these UEFIs further?\n\nGenerally yes. However doing so would require substantially more testing and time as further enhancements would require modification of individual modules the UEFI contains so I choose to satisfy as many people as possible with the time I have by making the most of what the UEFI already contains.\n\nWhy have you put these modified UEFIs here instead of Xtremesystems?\n\nUnlike in my earlier days when I tried to use a one size fits all approach to forums I frequented now I prefer specialised forums for what I do. Being surrounded by other people with knowledge in the same areas helps for getting answers.\n\nWhat UEFI is this modified flavour based on?\n\nThe latest available. When I said I had modified UEFIs I would release if things didn't improve Gigabyte, I meant it. You will find modified UEFIs for the following boards; X370: Gaming K3, Gaming K5, Gaming 5 (yes it's better than the K5), Gaming K7. B350: Gaming, Gaming 3.\n\nI can't guarantee I will always release modded UEFIs for every board that gets an updated UEFI but I will try to make sure each board gets a modded flavour with each UEFI release that updates the AGESA code.\n\nThere is an option not in the UEFI that I need other boards have, what do I do?\n\nThe first thing you should be doing is hassling Gigabyte they should at least be providing the same level of features the competition is them not doing so is just lazy. Secondly, you can ask me. If the option you need is already in the UEFI its just a case of enabling and unhiding it. I might even be able to do direct module replacement but that will depend on how much free time I have.\n\nHow to flash:\n\nQ-Flash Method\n\n1. Place image on a USB stick\n\n2.

  "latent_4196": "Shooting at the heads of incapacitated alleged Palestinian attackers is a common practice by Israeli occupation forces, a settler security chief told a military court hearing on Sunday.\n\nEliyahu Liebman testified as a witness for the defense in the trial of Elor Azarya, an Israeli soldier indicted for manslaughter after he was caught on video shooting the head of a wounded and incapacitated Palestinian lying in the street, killing him.\n\nAbd al-Fattah al-Sharif and Ramzi al-Qasrawi were fatally wounded after they allegedly attempted to stab soldiers in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in late March. Multiple videos of the scene show al-Sharif and al-Qasrawi in the street, badly injured. But video released thus far only shows the fatal shooting of al-Sharif.\n\n“In terrorist incidents I witnessed, I saw with my own eyes that in every instance in which a terrorist attacked, soldiers shot him in the center of mass until he was neutralized … and [shot] a bullet to the head to ensure that the terrorist could not set off a suicide belt or continue the attack. These soldiers never went to court,” Liebman, the longtime civilian security chief for Jewish settlers in Hebron, told the court.\n\n“A ‘neutralized terrorist’ means: either he attempted to carry out an attack and was shot in the chest and killed and then shot in the head to make sure – as is taught in the IDF [Israeli army] according to the rules of opening fire – or it means that the terrorist was checked by a sapper and was cuffed by the hands and feet,” Liebman added.\n\nThat protocol may have been implemented in other occasions in recent months.\n\nIn the Christmas Day slaying of Mahdia Hammad, a 40-year-old mother from Silwad village near the West Bank city of Ramallah, a combatant with Israel’s paramilitary Border Police “thrust his rifle into the bullet-riddled car and fired another volley into [Hammad’s] head, even though she was certainly dead by then,” the Tel Aviv newspaper Haaretz reported.\n\nThe Palestinian Centre for Human Rights reported that soldiers shot at the head of Mazen Oraibi at point-blank range after Oraibi was already dead. Oraibi, a Palestinian Authority security forces officer, was killed after he allegedly opened fire on soldiers at a checkpoint in December.\n\nAnother soldier under investigation\n\nAnother Israeli soldier who shot an unarmed Palestinian in the West Bank on Friday is being investigated for involuntary manslaughter, Israeli media reported on Monday.\n\nThe army has admitted that Iyad Zakariya Hamad, 38, posed no threat when he was shot near a military post at the entrance to the village of Silwad, near Ramallah, Haaretz stated.\n\nThe army maintains that Hamad was running toward a military post and did not heed soldiers’ orders to halt when he was shot.\n\nA Palestinian paramedic told Haaretz reporter Gideon Levy that he believes Hamad was shot in the back. “He saw an entry wound in the victim’s back and an exit wound in his chest,” Levy said of the paramedic.\n\nA witness told the Israeli rights group B’Tselem that Hamad, who was on his way to a mosque for Friday prayers, “had lost his way, panicked when he saw the soldiers at the checkpoint and ran,” according to Levy.\n\nThe soldier under investigation, who was not named by media, is from the ultra-Orthodox Netzah Yehuda battalion. Last year, soldiers from that unit were caught on video brutally beating a Palestinian father, and, in a separate incident, filmed themselves shooting an unarmed person in Silwad.\n\nHamad is the 220nd Palestinian slain by Israeli uniformed forces and armed civilians during a new phase of deadly confrontation that began in October, according to the Ma’an News Agency. More than 30 Israelis were killed during that same period.\n\nDozens of Palestinians were shot dead during what Israel says were attacks or alleged attacks on soldiers and civilians. Human rights groups have condemned Israel’s reflexive use of deadly force in such incidents, saying it amounts to an unofficial shoot-to-kill policy encouraged by Israel’s top leadership.\n\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights has also called for full investigation of incidents in which Israeli forces have caused death and injury. And in a rare display of protest, a ranking US Senator, along with 10 members of Congress, called on the State Department to investigate possible extrajudicial executions by Israeli military and police.\n\nVideos viewed as threat\n\nVideo footage of many of such incidents – not only Elor Azarya’s killing of Abd al-Fattah al-Sharif– shows that lethal force was used against Palestinians when they posed no immediate, life-threatening danger.\n\nIt was revealed during the Azarya trial that Israeli forces are instructed to quickly clear the scene when Palestinians are shot dead, to discourage documentation of the incident that would fuel Palestinian outrage.\n\nDuring his June testimony, Israeli colonel Yariv Ben-Ezra referred to the case of Hadil Hashlamoun, a young woman who was shot dead at a checkpoint in Hebron last September.\n\nVideo of the incident showed the young woman bleeding to death on the sidewalk without receiving first aid as Israeli settlers and soldiers stand around, some of them smiling and laughing.\n\nIsrael claimed that Hashlamoun had tried to stab a soldier, but photos and eyewitnesses contradicted the army’s narrative. Amnesty International described the incident as an extrajudicial execution.\n\n“We noticed that the long time that her body remained at the scene, while being filmed and photographed, created an entire wave of revenge and solidarity attacks – not just in Hebron, but all over the West Bank,” Ben-Ezra said.\n\n“From one incident to the next, we got a better understanding, and in light of the lessons we learned and the investigations we conducted, we realized that as soon as there is an attack in a crowded urban area, which is flooded with cameras on both sides, we must clear the scene as fast as possible, to prevent revenge and solidarity attacks. That is how we trained the soldiers,” Ben-Ezra added.\n\nOnly a handful of prosecutions\n\nSince the year 2000, in only a handful of cases were soldiers prosecuted for manslaughter in relation to the slaying of Palestinians, according to Haaretz.\n\nOf the four cases identified by the paper, in addition to Azarya and the unnamed soldier who killed Iyad Hamad, only one soldier was convicted of manslaughter for killing a British peace activist and served a six-and-a-half-year prison sentence. In other cases, soldiers were convicted of lesser charges and demoted in military rank.\n\nBen Dery, a military police combatant, is currently on trial for manslaughter in the shooting and killing of Nadim Siam Nuwara, 17, who was seen on video being fatally wounded during a Nakba Day protest in May 2014.\n\nDery is accused of switching “the blanks in his M16 with live bullets, although the forces on the scene had been instructed to use rubber-tipped steel bullets,” according to Haaretz.\n\nAnother Palestinian boy, Muhammad Abu al-Thahir, 16, was killed during the same demonstration as Nuwara. No one has been charged with killing Abu al-Thahir.\n\nThe Israeli military ordered Fakher Zayed, the Palestinian whose security cameras recorded the footage of the youths being shot, to dismantle his cameras or face legal proceedings.\n\nAn earlier version of this article was updated to add that the sole soldier convicted of manslaughter was not convicted over the killing of a Palestinian, but a British peace activist.",
  "latent_4337": "Media Relations\n\nTwo out of five medical students have an unconscious bias against obese people, according to a new study by researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center. The study is published online ahead of print in the Journal of Academic Medicine “Bias can affect clinical care and the doctor-patient relationship, and even a patient’s willingness or desire to go see their physician, so it is crucial that we try to deal with any bias during medical school,” said David Miller, M.D., associate professor of internal medicine at Wake Forest Baptist and lead author of the study.“Previous research has shown that on average, physicians have a strong anti-fat bias similar to that of the general population. Doctors are more likely to assume that obese individuals won’t follow treatment plans, and they are less likely to respect obese patients than average weight patients,” Miller said.Miller and colleagues conducted the study as part of their efforts to update the medical school’s curriculum on obesity. The goal was to measure the prevalence of unconscious weight-related biases among medical students and to determine whether the students were aware of those biases.The three-year study included more than 300 third-year medical students at a medical school in the southeastern United States from 2008 through 2011. The students were geographically diverse, representing at least 25 different states and 12 countries outside the United States.The researchers used a computer program called the Weight Implicit Association Test (IAT) to measures students’ unconscious preferences for “fat” or “thin” individuals. Students also answered a survey assessing their conscious weight-related preferences. The authors determined if the students were aware of their bias by seeing if their IAT results matched their stated preferences.Overall, 39 percent of medical students had a moderate to strong unconscious anti-fat bias as compared to 17 percent who had a moderate to strong anti-thin bias. Less than 25 percent of students were aware of their biases.“Because anti-fat stigma is so prevalent and a significant barrier to the treatment of obesity, teaching medical students to recognize and mitigate this bias is crucial to improving the care for the two-thirds of American adults who are now overweight or obese,” Miller said. “Medical schools should address weight bias as part of a comprehensive obesity curriculum.”While this study did not address which teaching strategies are most effective, Miller said that a prerequisite to combating prejudice is to first acknowledge its existence. At Wake Forest Baptist, all third-year medical students in the family medicine clerkship must complete the online IAT, and then participate in an in-class discussion of their experience with bias. In addition, students must accept that their bias could affect their actions and adopt new strategies to mitigate bias, he said.As part of their efforts to reform curriculum, the Wake Forest Baptist team created an on-line educational module about fat bias and stigmatization, which is freely available at www.newlifestyle.org.The study was funded by grant 1R25CA117887-01A from the National Cancer Institute.Co-authors of the study are John Spangler, M.D., Mara Vitolins, Dr.PH., Stephen Davis, M.S., Edward Ip, Ph.D., Gail Marion, Ph.D., and Sonia Crandall, Ph.D., of Wake Forest Baptist.\n\nMarguerite Beck: marbeck@wakehealth.edu, 336-716-2415\n\nBonnie Davis: bdavis@wakehealth.edu, 336-713-1597",

  "latent_4453": "This spring's spike in gun violence shows no sign of slowing with at least another 11 Northeast Florida residents shot since Monday including five killed and one not expected to survive.\n\nMuch of the gunfire this spring has been linked to gangs, drugs or the area's youth.\n\nOne such instance culminated in a high-speed chase through three counties ending with two juveniles in custody after a St. Johns County clerk was shot in the head and killed.\n\nAnother juvenile was arrested Thursday after a manhunt on two counts of attempted murder after bullets struck two teenage girls on a Jacksonville school bus. Also, a football scrimmage between First Coast and Ed White high schools was moved and the public barred from attending after recent violence involving students.\n\nThe violence has city officials reaching out to the federal government for assistance.\n\nOutgoing Mayor Alvin Brown sent a letter to the Department of Justice at the end of April seeking assistance with the city's gang problem. Federal officials sent a return letter pledging support from three different federal agencies last week.\n\nIt's not the first time federal assistance has been sought by Jacksonville leaders to combat gun violence. U.S. Attorney Frank Talbot oversees Project Safe Neighborhoods, a federal initiative that began in 2001 with the addition of hundreds of federal prosecutors nationwide focusing on gun violence and additional resources funneled into federal outreach efforts at schools.\n\nFederal assets have produced results, Talbot said.\n\nHe points to the Jacksonville Gun Unit, which is a partnership between the U.S. Attorney's Office, the State Attorney's Office, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives that meets biweekly.\n\n\"But the communication is constant,\" Talbot said.\n\nHe said he spends entire days communicating with the gun unit.\n\nWhile the unit hasn't received much publicity during its existence, its leaders are a who's who of the city's law enforcement.\n\nMark Caliel, lead assistant state attorney with the unit, said Sheriff-elect Mike Williams streamlined the unit about nine years ago and was its lieutenant. State Attorney Angela Corey was involved in the gun unit in the early 2000s, he said.\n\nCaliel said the unit was instrumental in the DreShawna Davis case - the 8-year-old killed in 2006 protecting her cousins from a hail of bullets fired into her home. The key witness against Rasheem Dubose supplied information after being leveraged by federal authorities.\n\nDubose, 31, was sentenced to death. DreShawna became the face of Jacksonville's state-leading homicide rate and galvanized city leaders to do something about it, resulting in the Jacksonville Journey. The Journey included community programs, additional police officers and other outreach efforts. Funding for the Journey has decreased by millions as the homicide rate decreased, but the shootings persist.\n\nTalbot said while the majority of his effort with Project Safe Neighborhoods focuses on prosecutions, but he does visit area schools to tell them about consequences involving gun crime. He used to clip out newspaper articles about gun violence. He doesn't do that as often anymore.\n\n\"I have too many of them already,\" he said.\n\nWilliams said the Sheriff's Office has a working relationship with every federal law enforcement agency in Jacksonville. He said the gun unit has been successful in Jacksonville largely because of the ability of federal prosecutors to pressure defendants with long prison sentences when a felon carries a firearm. The federal minimum penalty for a felon carrying a gun is five years in prison.\n\n\"It's huge for us. It gives us access to the federal courts and access to more investigators,\" he said. \"It's a good thing for the community for all of us to work together.\"\n\nDerek Gilliam: (904) 359-4619",

He also has his own group, the Kyle Gass Band, which he formed after the breakup of his first side-project, Trainwreck. Gass has also featured in numerous films such as Elf and Kung Fu Panda, as well as TV shows such as Friends and Seinfeld.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nKyle Gass was born in Walnut Creek, California, and has two brothers.[1] He attended Las Lomas High School, where he played flute in the marching band, and preceded G. Williams, graduating in 1978.[1] He studied acting at UCLA School of Theater, Film and Television, where he met Tim Robbins. In 1982, he would join Robbins' The Actors' Gang, with his first production being Out of Sight, Out of Mind. Several years following this, Gass would meet future Tenacious D bandmate Jack Black in the group.[3]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nActing career [ edit ]\n\nGass made his first on-screen appearance in 1988 in a 7-Up Gold commercial, and made his film debut two years later in Brain Dead.\n\nHe was featured in several episodes of the television show Fear of a Punk Planet, which has since been released on DVD. He has also made an appearance as a lawyer in the Good Charlotte video for \"Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous\". Along with Black, Gass made a comedic appearance as a hapless airplane mechanic in the Foo Fighters' 1999 video \"Learn to Fly.\"\n\nGass acted in the feature film Jacob's Ladder, which stars Tim Robbins. He made a cameo appearance in the Seinfeld episode \"The Abstinence\". Gass appeared in the comedy Elf as an inept author of children's books. He has played small roles in many of Black's films (Year One, Kung Fu Panda, Shallow Hal, Saving Silverman, The Cable Guy, etc.) Gass appeared in season 9 of Friends as a mugger, as the porn director in the 2008 teen film Extreme Movie, Walrus Boy in Wieners, and as the dirty trucker in the men's room in the 2008 film Sex Drive. He starred in the movie Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny alongside Jack Black. Gass had a cameo role as a singing karaoke cowboy in the 2007 movie Wild Hogs. In October 2008, Gass appeared as the character Decatur Doublewide in the film Lower Learning.[4]\n\nHe auditioned for a role as a demon in the pilot episode of Reaper, directed by Kevin Smith, but he was not hired, to Smith's disappointment.[5] He also appeared in the 22nd episode of the 2nd season of 2 Broke Girls as the special effects guy (also known as 'Cookie Guy').\n\nMusic career [ edit ]\n\nIn Tenacious D, Gass plays lead guitar and sings backing vocals, and also plays the role of Black's comic foil in most of their comedy routines.\n\nWhile appearing on Late Night with Conan O'Brien on November 15, 2006,[6] Gass claimed to have been the youngest graduate of the Juilliard School of Music with a degree in classical guitar studies at the age of 13. It should be pointed out that Juilliard did not have a guitar program in 1973, but began its graduate level guitar program in 1989 under Sharon Isbin, and its undergraduate program in 2007. Earlier, in an article in the Sunday Times on October 29, 2006, Black stated that Gass was the youngest graduate of Juilliard.[7] On May 13, 2008, Gass was a phone-in guest on the Adam Carolla Show. When Adam Carolla asked him \"... And did you go to Juilliard?\" Kyle replied \"I didn't. I—you know, I made that up as a joke,\" he continued, \"and I thought it would be hilarious, and then I've been hearing about it ever since. Apologies to Juilliard.\"[8]\n\nGass is featured as a minor character in the 2009 video game Brütal Legend (in which Jack Black plays the lead role), where he portrays Kage the Kannonier, a self-pitying giant in charge of a mortar cannon.\n\nGass stars in a web show, Guitarings, with John Konesky.[citation needed]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nGass is the godfather of Jack Black’s son.[9][10]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nwith Trainwreck [ edit ]\n\nTrainwreck – 2 Tracks (2003)\n\n(2003) Trainwreck Live (2004)\n\n(2004) Trainwreck – The EP (2006)\n\n(2006) The Wreckoning (2009)\n\nwith Kyle Gass Band [ edit ]\n\nKyle Gass Band (2013)\n\n(2013) Thundering Herd (2016)\n\nwith Tenacious D [ edit ]\n\nStudio albums [ edit ]\n\nEPs [ edit ]\n\nLive albums [ edit ]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nMusic videos [ edit ]\n\nYear Video Role Label 1999 Foo Fighters - Learn to Fly Flight attendant Roswell/RCA 2001 Good Charlotte - Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous Lawyer Epic Records 2017 I Prevail - Already Dead Man on computer Fearless Records",

Let us take this fight from here. Please stand down. Please stand down. Go home and hug your families.\"\n\nIn a federal indictment unsealed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in Portland, the FBI said Bundy intended for the refuge — which he and his followers occupied on Jan. 2 — to become a permanent headquarters for anti-government \"patriots from all over the country.\"\n\nAccording to the FBI, Bundy says in a video: \"We're planning on staying here for several years.\"\n\nLocal and federal authorities arrested the suspects late Tuesday afternoon, most of them as they were driving to the town of John Day to attend a community meeting.\n\nRelated: Feds Intercepted Occupation Leaders as Part of Plan: Official\n\nIn addition to Ammon and Ryan Bundy, others named in the indictment are:\n\nJon Ritzheimer\n\nJoseph O'Shaughnessy\n\nRyan Payne\n\nBrian Cavalier\n\nShawna Cox\n\nPeter Santilli\n\nAll are charged with conspiring to impede federal officers from discharging their official duties through the use of force, intimidation or threats.\n\nA seventh follower, Robert LaVoy Finicum, was shot and killed under circumstances that haven't been explained. A memorial vigil was observed for Finicum in Burns on Wednesday night.\n\nLate Wednesday, the FBI announced officers had arrested without incident three more people in connection with the occupation. Duane Leo Ehmer, 45, and Dylan Wade Anderson, 34, turned themselves in to authorities at a checkpoint outside the wildlife refuge around 3:30 p.m. Wednesday. Jason S. Patrick turned himself in at approximately 7:40 p.m.\n\nSince checkpoints were established early Wednesday, authorities have allowed five people to leave the refuge without arrest, the FBI said in a statement.\n\nMost of the evidence cited in the FBI affidavit comprises previously available blog and social media posts and videos by the defendants, along with news reports of their comments.\n\nThe affidavit reports that on Oct. 5, 2015, Payne and Ammon Bundy visited Harney County Sheriff Dave Ward to warn him that there would be \"extreme civil unrest\" if Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven, 46 — who set fires that spread to government lands they leased to graze cattle — were allowed to go free.\n\nIn January, the Hammonds disassociated themselves from the occupiers.\n\nThat meeting appears to have been what Ward was referring to in a news conference Wednesday, when he said the suspects \"had ultimatums that I couldn't meet. I'm here to uphold the law.\"",

Maybe I shouldn’t answer this.\n\nSo, what's the logic? Clearly I wrote something worthy of Google, right?\n\nWell, no I didn't. I wrote a simple package manager. Anyone could write one. And in fact mine is pretty bad. It doesn't do dependency management properly. It doesn’t handle edge case behavior well. It isn’t well tested. It’s shit frankly.\n\nIs it any surprise I couldn’t answer their heavily computer-science questions well?\n\nOn the other hand, my software was insanely successful. Why is that? Well the answer is not in the realm of computer science. I have always had a user-experience focus to my software. Homebrew cares about the user. When things go wrong with Homebrew it tries as hard as it can to tell you why, it searches GitHub for similar issues and points you to them. It cares about *you*. Most tools don’t give a shit about you. If they go wrong, well screw you. Homebrew helps you. And if it can’t help you I made it so, so easy to fix Homebrew (I built a command into the base for editing and fixing Homebrew). You can make Homebrew better. Homebrew is a shining example of true Open Source.\n\nMaybe Homebrew doesn’t do dependency management well, but it does it in a way you care about. Unlike the competition at the time Homebrew used the dependencies on your Mac as a base thus saving you intense amounts of time installing software and quite a lot of pain, because practically speaking a large dependency graph breaks. But that isn't computer science and it didn’t involve any graphs or trees so I guess I suck.\n\nI want to defend Google, for one I wasn't even inverting a binary tree, I wasn’t very clear what a binary tree was. I studied Chemistry not Comp-Sci. Sure, for my masters dissertation I used Mathematica and modeled the quantum mechanical properties of Helium—I did a good job actually—but it wasn’t computer science. But well, what the fuck does comp-sci have to do with modern app development? And well, that’s all I want people to take from my tweet.\n\nGoogle in fact gave me seven interviews and I did well in the software engineering ones, because that is actually my talent. I feel bad about my tweet, I don’t feel it was fair, and it fed the current era of outragism-driven-reading that is the modern Internet, and thus went viral, and for that I am truly sorry.\n\nBut ultimately, should Google have hired me? Yes, absolutely yes. I am often a dick, I am often difficult, I often don’t know computer science, but. BUT. I make really good things, maybe they aren't perfect, but people really like them. Surely, surely Google could have used that.",

Not so for Ahmed: Halfway through his year in the United States, Yemen descended into a civil war, closing the nation’s airports and making it impossible for him to return.\n\nHis mother, who fled the family home after it was bombed twice, put it to him plainly. “She said I need to start to search for a future here, because there is no future there,” said Ahmed, now 16.\n\nAhmed is one of 31 Yemeni high school students who came to this country as part of the Kennedy-Lugar Youth Exchange and Study (YES) program in August, all of them now trapped by uncertainty. They can’t go home, and they can’t stay in the United States permanently because they are not citizens.\n\nYemenis sit aboard a bus loaded with mattresses and belongings of the people fleeing the ongoing fighting between militiamen land Shiite Houthi rebels on June 10 in the port city of Aden. (Saleh Al-Obeidi/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nScattered across the country in the homes of their host families, the teenagers have watched as their home country has fallen apart, their Facebook feeds filling with images of familiar neighborhood landmarks reduced to rubble. They have heard stories about friends who were killed in crossfire. They have lain awake at night, worrying about their mothers and fathers and sisters and brothers.\n\nDays and sometimes weeks pass without contact from their families.\n\nThey also have struggled with where they can go, if not home — their student visas are set to expire soon — and how they will support themselves.\n\nThe State Department began urging students several months ago to identify family or friends in other countries who could take them in when their U.S. visas expire. State Department officials said they couldn’t help anyone secure permission to stay here, according to a letter they sent to Yemeni exchange participants in May.\n\nSome, seeing no other option, decided to try to stay anyway.\n\n“It’s so hard,” said Wafa Salem, 17, who had no friends or family in another country, and who decided to drop out of the exchange program and seek asylum.\n\nState Department exchange programs bring tens of thousands of people to the United States every year, and political conflicts or natural disasters sometimes disrupt their return travel plans. But this is the first time the State Department has grappled with helping a group that is so large and so young, officials said.\n\n1 of 65 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × Saudi Arabia leads airstrikes in Yemen View Photos An airstrike campaign, with a coalition of Arab nations, is an effort to dislodge Houthi rebels sweeping through Yemen. Caption The campaign, with a coalition of Arab nations, is an effort to dislodge Houthi rebels sweeping through Yemen. April 4, 2015 Yemenis search for survivors in the rubble of houses destroyed by Saudi-led airstrikes in a village near the capital city of Sanaa, Yemen. Since their advance began last year, the Shiite rebels, known as Houthis, have overrun Sanaa and several provinces. Hani Mohammed/AP Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nMost of the Yemeni students remain in the U.S. government’s care, spending the summer at a leadership institute in Lynchburg, Va. They await news of their fate as they fast for Ramadan.\n\nState Department officials said they are working on a longer-term solution to keep the students safe and cared for after August, recognizing that Yemen is unlikely to be stable by then. But they said they could not yet provide further details.\n\n“The State Department is very concerned about the safety and security of all of our exchange programs, obviously including these very young people,” said Chris Miner, the department’s managing director of professional and cultural exchanges.\n\nYemen’s civil war began early this year after Shiite insurgents known as Houthis took the capital, Sanaa, and forced out the president. The Houthis then pushed south, besieging the port city of Aden. A coalition of countries led by Saudi Arabia has conducted a bombing campaign in an effort to drive the Houthis back.\n\nAt least 2,000 civilians have been killed in the violence, and thousands more have been injured. The war has forced at least a million people to flee their homes and has left many more millions without clean drinking water or enough to eat.\n\nWafa Salem was originally placed with a host family in Buffalo. But she grew so distressed about the war that she stopped going to school and stopped eating. She contemplated suicide, she said, once going as far as cutting her wrist. She was desperately homesick in a city that saw more than 100 inches of snow in winter — as different as could be from subtropical Yemen.\n\n“I stayed in my room for three days crying,” she said. “That’s why I was thinking to kill myself, because no one was feeling what I feel.”\n\nShe wore a hijab, and at times that made her a target in Upstate New York. One day, on her way to the pharmacy, a woman told her to go back to her country. “We don’t want Muslims in America,” Wafa recalled the woman shouting.\n\nIn February, Wafa traveled to Houston to visit a family friend, who convinced her that it was too dangerous to return to Yemen. Wafa stayed in Houston, where she is awaiting word about her asylum application. In the meantime, she is unable to work or go to school.\n\nHer dream is that she’ll be granted an opportunity to stay in the United States and will have a chance to give her family an exit from the war by bringing them here. “That’s why I’m suffering here, for them,” she said. “That’s all for them, to be safe.”\n\nAhmed has seen photos of sewage and corpses in the streets, of apartment buildings with crumbling facades and burned balconies, of his favorite bakery in Aden, leveled.\n\n“It’s not a place anybody wants to be,” he said of Yemen. “I feel very homesick, but when I see all that going on, I would never want to go home.”\n\nAhmed’s student visa expires in July. He has no close contacts in other countries, and he doesn’t know what the State Department will end up doing for students like him. He, too, is applying for asylum, arguing that his time in America would make him a target of anti-Western extremists if he were to go home.\n\nThere is plenty he has loved about his experience here, including Disney World’s Epcot Center (“magical,” he said) and Halloween (he dressed up as a ghoul). He loved Christmas ­carols and the lights and cheer of New York City. But he was struck by the gulf between his own concerns and those of his American peers, who he said seemed to spend a lot of energy worrying about the state of their romantic relationships. “It was a little bit shocking,” Ahmed said.\n\nHis host father, 72-year-old retired teacher Larry Cornell, invited Ahmed to continue staying with him, at least long enough to finish school at Palmetto High next year. Cornell, whose wife died a few years ago, is not wealthy — he lives on his pension and Social Security — but he wants to help.\n\nAhmed calls him “Dad.” Cornell is seeking to become Ahmed’s legal guardian.\n\n“He’s a good kid,” Cornell said. “As much as he drives me crazy and I drive him crazy, I think we’re a good match.”\n\nAhmed’s mother said it is not easy to be separated from her son, but she is happy that he is safe. “Please say thanks to your host dad and tell him that I will never forget what he is doing for you,” she said in a message that Ahmed translated.\n\nOutgoing and friendly with an easy smile, Ahmed has won many supporters in Palmetto, a onetime farming community on Florida’s Gulf Coast that now boasts more strip malls than orange groves. Lori Fabiano, the high school librarian, got to know him when he volunteered to help in the stacks after school.\n\n“He handled all of this horror with such seeming grace and calm,” Fabiano said. “He was so upbeat and happy and so appreciative to be here and have this experience.”\n\nAhmed said he didn’t talk about his country’s war all that much at school. He didn’t want anyone to feel sorry for him. “I just want to feel normal,” he said.\n\nAnd in many ways, he is a lot like an average American teen. He joined his high school’s choir this year and went to the Roaring Twenties-themed prom. He wants to get a job and earn some spending money, and he wants to go to college. He’s determined to learn how to drive.\n\nBut at night, when he’s alone and undistracted, anxiety consumes him. He worries that his family will be killed; he worries about how he’s going to pay for college; he worries about what he will do if his asylum application is rejected.\n\n“There’s a lot of stuff I have to think about,” he said. “I lay on the bed and don’t sleep.”\n\nLike Wafa, Ahmed feels responsible for his mother and father. His goal is to bring them to the United States to escape what he feels is a hopeless situation in Yemen. When he feels fearful, he repeats his mantra: God shall provide.\n\n“It doesn’t have to be a great life,” Ahmed said. “But at least a better life.”",
  "latent_4558": "By Rabbi Yair Hoffman for the Five Towns Jewish Times\n\nPokemon GO is a game that is generally played on mobile phones that uses something called augmented reality. Virtual creatures appear on the screen that otherwise appears to be your outside surroundings. The goal of the game is to battle, capture and train these virtual creatures. The game has achieved record status in terms of downloading. Over 10 million people downloaded the game in the first week, and it was only released in July. It is estimated that one out of every four android phones have downloaded this game. Five days after its release, the market value of Nintendo stock rose nine billion dollars. That is huge.\n\nThe problem is one of distraction.\n\nAcross the country, indeed, the world, players of Pokemon GO are concerned about fighting and capturing the Pokemon, and pay little attention to what actually lies before them physically. In California, two men fell off a 90 foot cliff while hunting Pokemon in Encinitas. In Baltimore, a Pokemon GO player crashed his SUV into a police vehicle and it was filmed by the officer’s body cam. A New Jersey woman climbed a tree inside Eglington Cemetery and had to call 911 when she could not get herself down.\n\nThe game was just released in Japan last week. In Otso, Japan, this past Monday, a 21-year-old worker drove into a line of cars waiting at a red light while playing the game. “I was focused on the game and did not notice the car in front of me,” the man was quoted as telling the police. In Sapporo, Japan, an elementary school student who was playing the game while cycling crashed into another bicycle Sunday morning, the police said. The student suffered minor injuries.\n\nTHE QUESTION\n\nWhat happens if Reuvain leaves an item on the sidewalk, and Shimon, who is playing Pokemon GO, smashes it while walking. Who is responsible? And what if it was a bicycle and it was the Pokemon GO player, who got injured or his phone got damaged? Is Reuvain who left his bicycle on the sidewalk responsible for the damage to Shimon’s or his phone? Does the fact that Shimon was playing Pokemon GO make any difference?\n\nAlso, another question arises too, pointed out by my young chevrusah, Yisroel Reichman. If the Pokemon GO player got eaten by the Pokemon monster as a result of his stumbling upon the bicycle left on the sidewalk and the player suffered a financial loss as a result of his tripping over the item – does the owner of the bicycle have to pay damages?\n\nGENERAL HALACHA\n\nAlthough it may seem counter-intuitive, the general halacha is that a person who is walking and breaks something – is exempt. This is based upon a fascinating principle found in Bava Kamma 27b. There it states that it is not the nature of a person who is walking to be looking down below as to where he is walking. For this reason, if Reuvain has dug a pit in a public area, he is responsible for the damage that Shimon incurred while walking. Leaving out a bicycle where someone can trip is analogous to digging a hole in a public area. The Aruch HaShulchan (CM 412:5) states this.\n\nAPPLICATION TO POKEMON GO\n\nFrom the above, it would seem that the Pokemon GO player is exempt and the person who left the bicycle out may even be responsible for the broken phone of the Pokemon GO player.\n\nHowever, there may be another issue going on here. The view of the Tosfos (UShmuel 27b) is that there are two types of Ones – and only a complete Ones is exempt from damages. The Baalei Tosfos (based on the Gemorah in Bava Metziah 82b) distinguish between a watchman who allowed an item to get lost versus a watchman who allowed an item to get stolen. They thus distinguish between two types of Ones. It can readily be argued that a Pokemon GO player who breaks an item is compared to the lesser Ones and is thus liable. It could also be argued that the concept of “people do not look where they are going” applies here across the board and the Pokemon GO player is not making things worse.\n\nThe language of the Shulchan Aruch (in CM 378:1 as the Shach clarifies), indicates that a person who causes another damage must pay. However, this is only if it is a complete Ones completely faultless. We assume that the halacha of “a person generally is busy with his thoughts and does not look downward” is treated like an Ones Gamur. If, however, it was not a complete Ones, but only a partial Ones – it would seem that he would be obligated to pay.\n\nThe Gemorah in Bava Kamma 48b – the reason is that both either had permission or didn’t have permission, but if one had permission to be there and the other did not – the one that did not is liable.\n\nThe Chazon Ish (Bava Kamma 4:2) explains the halachic of present “with permission” and present “without permission” as if someone is doing something wrong then he is financially responsible.\n\nKIM LEE\n\nThere is also a concept in halacha (see Shach Choshain Mishpat 183:10) called, Kim Lee kehani Poskim – I know that the halacha is in accordance with these Poskim.” This position may be claimed by any person that is holding onto to certain property or moneys and can be invoked in almost any debate in the rishonim. The Maharsham (Volume IV #27) states that the muchzak can claim Kim Lee like the opinion that obligates payment. This would apply either to Reuvain or Shimon the Pokemon GO player. Thus, it would seem that the Pokemon GO player can always say that he holds the halacha is that he is exempt. The owner of the bicycle can say that he holds like the Chazon Ish and that he is exempt.\n\nWhat about any financial losses that are incurred by the Pokemon GO player in his avatar being eaten by the Pokemon creature? It would seem that these fall under the parameters of Grama – an indirect loss. The halacha discusses two types of indirect damage. There is an indirect form of damage called “Garmi.” A Garmi is when an indirect form of damage results is viewed as a clear, present and highly likely result. If Reuvain were to rip up Shimon’s train ticket, for example, that is a Garmi form of damage. If Reuvain were to poison Shimon’s dog by placing a poisonous food next to him, this is considered Gramah not Garmi. It may very well be that Shimon’s animal will not eat the food. Garmi damages are enforceable in a Bais Din. Gramah damages are not. If the player had some financial interests somehow in his Pokemon GO avatar, the damage would at best be Gramah and the other person would be exempt.\n\nAll this strictly refers to Pokemon GO players on foot. If they are driving or on a bicycle – they would be completely liable.\n\nThe author can be reached at yairhoffman2@gmail.com\n\nThe seventh volume of Not Your Usual Halacha has just been released.

He is a political prodigy, having been elected to San Antonio City Council at the tender age of 26. He knows the inner-workings of Washington having been a high ranking member of the previous presidential cabinet. He’s been relatively quiet and been scandal free aside from a minor violation of the Hatch Act. However , in our current political climate these would seem to be his undoing.\n\nAmerica wants flamboyant outsiders who can keep our attention. With the Trump presidency on the ropes for what some allege is an improper relationship with the Russia, the next candidate for president is of the utmost importance. Many on the left are calling for Elizabeth Warren Elizabeth Ann WarrenSanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' House to push back at Trump on border GOP Sen. Tillis to vote for resolution blocking Trump's emergency declaration MORE. While all eyes are on Warren and she has become the energetic moral compass of the Democratic Party, Castro gives the Democrats the best chance to win in 2020.\n\nTrump won because he was the anti-Obama in every way. While Obama carefully navigated the press, Trump antagonized them. While Obama tried to be inclusive,Trump marketed himself as a builder of walls.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCastro is the perfect person to market himself as the Anti-Trump. While President Trump and his administration target immigrants, Castro can say he is an American born descendant of immigrants and a friend to those communities. His Mexican-American heritage and activist parents help him in Arizona and in Florida. Meanwhile, Warren’s ethnicity and heritage has become point of ridicule, as she claimed to be Native American but but has difficulty proving it.\n\nWhile the a large portion of the Cuban American community turned against Clinton, the increasing number of Puerto Ricans in Florida favors Castro in 2020.\n\nTexas could eventually swing toward Democrats, and could do so with a compelling candidate. Warren being a leftist from Massachusetts is not going to change the vote in the Lone Star state. Castro, a wildly popular mayor and native San Antonian could very well change the shade of Texas by convincing moderate Republican Latinos to vote for him.\n\nCastro is a youthful and seemingly healthy 42 year old, something that dogged Hillary Clinton on the campaign trail. Trump will be 74 in 2020, and questions about his energy level could soon arise after being worn down by 4 year of a presidential schedule. Ditto for Bernie Sanders Bernard (Bernie) SandersPush to end U.S. support for Saudi war hits Senate setback Sanders: 'I fully expect' fair treatment by DNC in 2020 after 'not quite even handed' 2016 primary Sanders: 'Damn right' I'll make the large corporations pay 'fair share of taxes' MORE, who some see as the heir apparent within the Democratic Party.\n\nSanders and Warren also have a paper trail behind them in the form of a voting record in the Senate.\n\nCastro however, has no voting record to be manipulated and seemingly less political baggage.

In addition, the Democrats cannot to afford to risk losing Warren's senate seat.\n\nJulian Castro’s silence, particularly now, is a virtue. Twitter wars with the president don’t bode well for politicians. Warren has over-exposed herself as an attack dog for Clinton and thus, put herself in the crosshairs of the GOP.\n\nThey are strategizing against her at this very moment, just as they did for Secretary Clinton. Mr. Castro’s best bet is to leave the lampooning to Saturday Night Live, Bill Maher, Jimmy Fallon and the rest of the professionals.\n\nRight now, Castro should be spending time in African American churches and barbershops in Detroit, Philadelphia, Cleveland, and in the state of North Carolina. He needs to galvanize the loyal Democratic base that was unmotivated to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016. He should be headed to Wisconsin to meet with teachers unions and coal miners in West Virginia. His being based in Texas is another major asset.\n\nMostly, he needs to meet with Warren and convince her that it is not in the party’s best interest that she run. Warren running versus Castro sets up another tiring Sanders/Clinton scenario and the former is too closely associated with Hillary Clinton's historic campaign failure.\n\nIn the meantime, Democrats need to continue to develop female candidates so one will be in position to crack the glass ceiling covering the presidency.\n\nJason Nichols, Ph.D. is a full time faculty member in the African American Studies Department at the University of Maryland College Park.

  "latent_4652": "The pipeline for energy efficiency projects is set to get a big boost from institutional investors.\n\nTwo organizations, Joule Assets and Kilowatt Financial, have unveiled separate $100 million funds for efficiency projects. The two funds were announced within one day of each other.\n\nKilowatt Financial, a financier of solar and efficiency projects, closed a $100 million credit facility with Citi yesterday -- creating a fund for ten- to twelve-year loans of up to $30,000 targeted at homeowners.\n\nThe fund may open the door to securitization, a financial tool that could expand efficiency investment to mutual funds, pension funds and big banks eager for new pooled assets.\n\n\"This transaction will allow Kilowatt to launch a much-anticipated market for the securitization of consumer energy efficiency loans in the U.S.,\" said Marshal Salant, Citi's managing director of alternative energy finance in a statement.\n\nAs Kilowatt's portfolio swells, Citi will be able to slice and dice the loans and sell them in tranches, much like was done in the mortgage industry. SolarCity recently announced the first securitization of solar projects, a $54.4 million pool with a 4.8 percent yield. That issuance was a landmark for the solar industry, and may soon bring similar deals from other large solar service companies.\n\nFinancial experts often mark the threshold for securitization at around $100 million. Without such a big portfolio of projects, it's very difficult to bundle projects and get institutional investors involved. This has led to the industry-wide effort to create large funds for projects.\n\n\"To attract the capital at pension funds, mutual funds, insurance companies and others, these retrofits need to be packaged into something these funds can invest in,\" said Brandon Smithwood, senior manager of the policy program at Ceres, in an email.\n\nThe second fund, put together by the efficiency financier and insurer Joule Assets, will aggregate global demand response and efficiency projects for private equity investors. Joule CEO Mike Gordon said in an interview that \"at minimum\" he expects to deploy $100 million over three years, with the long-term goal of scaling up to $500 million and beyond.\n\nJoule has set up a C corporation to manage the captive fund. The firm plans to aggregate portfolios of projects using software that identifies values and risks without having to negotiate with every individual contractor. Gordon said the product \"acts as an underpinning for the investment fund.\"\n\nJoule is partnering with developers that already have sizable portfolios of demand response and efficiency projects, not one-off retrofits. Gordon said developers are required to provide a loan loss reserve that covers failures -- giving them access greater amounts of capital, but making them responsible for poorly performing projects.\n\n\"It's their reserve covering any failed projects. They might get $10 million in financing, but they are still exposed to the loss of a million dollars. On the flip side, they're able to extend $10 million in financing by putting down a million bucks. They're ultimately able to make that decision as long as they have diversification in their portfolio,\" said Gordon.\n\nSo far, the fund has been open to family and friends close to Joule Assets, and it was recently opened up to family foundations. Now Gordon says Joule has built a big enough pipeline to offer it to a broader range of institutional investors. Gordon said he expects investors to get a \"solid, low-risk product\" with returns somewhere between 7 percent and 10 percent -- a statement he makes with plenty of necessary caution.\n\nWhile structured much differently, these two funds from Joule Assets and Kilowatt Financial are the kinds of financial products efficiency advocates have been hoping for.\n\nThe announcements are \"an important step forward in creating this secondary market,\" said Ceres' Smithwood, who identified institutional investors as a necessary element for scaling efficiency in a recent white paper.\n\nHowever, the efficiency industry suffers from a severe disaggregation problem due to inconsistent lending standards and performance data. That limits financing for smaller projects.\n\nIn a survey of 3,000 efficiency professionals released in December, Joule Assets reported that 67 percent of projects under $250,000 lack sufficient financing. That is the project size Joule is looking to target.\n\nLast August, Noesis Energy released a similar survey of 328 efficiency professionals showing that 43 percent of outside contractors (firms not pitching projects internally) don't offer customers any financing options. Noesis is attempting to leverage its efficiency matchmaking service for third-party financing for smaller contractors, an arrangement that has been successful for the solar-services company Clean Power Finance.\n\nOther companies are experimenting with new financing options and starting to see success.\n\nMetrus Energy, a company developing a power purchase agreement for efficiency, in which customers own and pay for nothing except for the energy savings, just closed an $8.5 million project in Hawaii yesterday. The company has a $75 million pipeline of projects in the commercial sector where traditional energy service companies have failed to gain much traction.\n\nEnergyRM is experimenting with the metered energy efficiency transaction, or MEETS, another variation of a power purchase agreement that preserves utility revenue and eliminates disincentives for efficiency. The company is taking a site by site approach, but believes it can scale nationwide.\n\nThe securitization getting underway in the solar industry is a direct result of the large portfolios that project developers have accumulated thanks to new financial arrangements, particularly in residential sector. With multiple $100 million funds now in the works for efficiency and companies getting traction on new financing options, that industry is just a few steps behind solar.\n\n\"Securitization in the solar sector is just now taking off and solving some of the same challenges [related to standardization and risk],\" said Joule's Gordon. \"We are following on the heels of the great ideas there.\"",
  "latent_4679": "Democrat Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton has been a long time advocate of the death tax, or what her campaign likes to call \"revenue enhancements.\" But a close look at Hillary's financial statements, which were released last week in an effort to distract away from newly released State Department emails, shows efforts to evade the death tax by locking up money and assets in trusts. More from Americans for Tax Reform:\n\nNewly released tax returns from Hillary Clinton, disclosed in a Friday evening news dump last week, suggest she has been using a Death Tax avoidance strategy. Through the creation of a trust account, the Clintons appear to be engaging in legal but hypocritical measures to avoid paying the Death Tax Hillary Clinton has spent a career defending.\n\nClinton has consistently voted for the Death Tax throughout her time in public office and forcefully condemned attempts to lower it. But when it comes to her own finances, it is a different story. The newly released tax returns buttress earlier reports outlining the ways Clinton uses financial planning strategies that shield her Death Tax liability.\n\nMore on her death tax record:\n\n-In 2001, Clinton voted no on H.R. 1836, “the Economic Growth and Tax Reconciliation Act,” which contained a series of tax cuts, one of which increased the Death Tax exemption level to $3.5 million.\n\n-In 2005, Clinton voted no on H.R. 8, “the Death Tax Repeal Permanency Act of 2005,” which fully repealed the Death Tax.\n\n-In 2006, Clinton voted no on H.R. 5970, “the Estate Tax and Extension of Tax Relief Act of 2006,” which increased the Death Tax exemption level to $5 million.\n\n-In 2008, Clinton voted no on S.Amdt.4191, legislation to increase the Death Tax exemption level to $5 million.\n\nThis is just another example of Clinton exempting herself from a policy she advocates for the rest of the country, further proving she is out of touch with the reality of government burden on those who need relief the most. Apparently protecting her own wealth is more important than protecting the wealth of Americans she claims to care about. The death tax is especially burdensome on middle class families in the farming and ranching businesses.\n\nTennessee farmer Brandon Whitt told the House Ways and Means Committee this past March that the estate tax–often called the death tax by opponents–is crippling his and other family farm operations across the country.\n\nIn public testimony, Whitt said his father-in-law was forced to sell off a large portion of farm land in 1998 to pay the estate tax when he inherited the operation. What’s left, Whitt said, is a seventh-generation farm with little liquid assets and an inability to expand.\n\nDuring the Bush administration, the death tax was eliminated. President Obama brought it back during his first term.",
  "latent_4754": "ALLENTOWN — A former Philadelphia Flyer, along with a former coach for both the Flyers and Phantoms, will be on hand in Allentown for the AHL's All-Star festivities.\n\nDanny Briere and Terry Murray were named the honorary captains for the 2017 AHL All-Star Classic, which the PPL Center is hosting over the final few days of January.\n\nThe two will join teams in their locker rooms and be present on the benches during the Classic. They will also be recognized for their careers at the Hall of Fame induction and awards ceremony Monday, Jan. 30.\n\nLast year in Syracuse Mike Peca and Scott Walker, original Crunch players, were honorary captains.\n\nBriere, who earned the nickname \"Mr. Playoffs\" for scoring 72 points in 68 postseason games as a Flyer, spent six of his 17 NHL seasons in Philadelphia. He led the NHL with 30 points in 23 playoff games during the Flyers' run to the Stanley Cup finals in 2010.\n\nHe spent the majority of his first four professional seasons in the AHL and won the Dudley \"Red\" Garrett Memorial Award as the AHL's outstanding rookie in 1997-98. He briefly played for the Philadelphia Phantoms during the 2008-09 campaign.\n\nThe 39-year-old retired from the NHL in August of 2015 and, while he has no official title, has been assisting the Flyers' front office on the business side of things since.\n\nMurray, who is currently an assistant coach with the Buffalo Sabres, drew up X's and O's for both the NHL Flyers and the AHL Phantoms.\n\nHis first stint behind the bench in the organization came when he was a head coach the Flyers for three years beginning with the 1994-95 season. Murray was fired and served in a number of positions both with the Flyers, as well as other teams.

  "latent_4801": "A new investigation by The Intercept reveals the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the GCHQ, hacked into the internal computer network of the largest manufacturer of SIM cards in the world, stealing encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cellphone communications across the globe. The secret operation targeted the Dutch company Gemalto. Its clients include AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint and some 450 wireless network providers around the world.\n\nIn part two of our interview, we speak with Christopher Soghoian of the American Civil Liberties Union about ways to securely use your cellphone.\n\nWatch Part 1 here.\n\nIn our online archive, watch all of our reports about NSA surveillance and the leaks of Edward Snowden.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now!, democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report. I’m Amy Goodman, with part two on a new investigation by The Intercept that reveals the National Security Agency and its British counterpart, the GCHQ, hacked into the internal computer network of the largest manufacturer of SIM cards in the world, stealing encryption keys used to protect the privacy of cellphone communications across the globe. The secret operation targeted the Dutch company Gemalto. Its clients include AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon, Sprint and some 450 wireless network providers around the world. It produces two billion SIM cards a year.\n\nTo talk more about the significance of this story, we’re joined by Chris Soghoian. He’s the principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, a visiting fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project. The piece is in The Intercept that reveals all of this, and it’s by former Democracy Now! correspondent, Intercept co-founder, Jeremy Scahill.\n\nChris Soghoian, in part two of our discussion, first quickly summarize what the great SIM heist is.\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: So, in this operation, GCHQ, which is Britain’s intelligence agency, hacked into this major Dutch supplier of SIM cards. This is a company that provides these microchips to wireless carriers around the world, and these are the chips that provide the security that’s in our phones. They secure the communications between our phone and the phone network and are intended to protect our calls and text messages from interception by private parties.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Should Gemalto be doing—can they protect the SIM card?\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: I mean, what’s in the story, the anecdotes that are revealed in the story suggest that Gemalto and its wireless carrier partners have at times followed pretty pathetic security practices, and so it didn’t seem like—that GCHQ had to work too hard in some cases. But, you know, that was just for some of the collection. In other cases, it seems like GCHQ—GCHQ’s hackers targeted and hunted individual engineers and employees. I mean, they were stalking these engineers online in an effort to compromise their email accounts, their Facebook accounts, and then ultimately to compromise their computers as a way to gain access to the inner sanctum of Gemalto’s network. That kind of stalking of engineers is really terrifying, particularly given that, you know, we’re not talking here about a government stalking or targeting a terrorist. These engineers are not accused of breaking any law. These are law-abiding people who have mortgages and families and husbands and wives, and they just happen to work for companies that these intelligence agencies, you know, think are fair game. And, you know, I think this article, building on The Intercept's piece last year about GCHQ's hacking of Belgacom, Belgium’s largest phone company, is really going to serve as a wake-up call to the entire technical industry, because, you know, in essence now, it seems clear that any engineer at any company that does anything remotely interesting is now fair game for GCHQ and NSA and their other partners.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: How do AT&T and Verizon compare to companies like Google and Apple?\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: So, the phone companies don’t do a very good in securing their communications. The encryption technology that’s built into your phone, the technology that protects your telephone calls and text messages as they go over the air, the encryption was built in the late '80s and early ’90s. It was—forms of it were broken in the 1990s by graduate students, and we're still using it today. These carriers are—these large, multibillion-dollar telephone companies are really not that interested in providing a secure method of communication. They’re certainly not interested in designing or deploying methods of communication that our own governments cannot intercept, let alone other governments. And, you know, for more than a hundred years, the U.S. telephone companies have been happily providing wiretapping assistance to law enforcement and intelligence agencies. We should just—we should give up on this idea that AT&T or T-Mobile or Verizon are ever going to deliver truly secure communications to their customers.\n\nYou know, in contrast, it really does seem like Silicon Valley companies are much more interested in providing strong, secure communications services, to the extent that their business models permit. And what I mean by that is, you know, at the end of the day, you’re not paying Google for their services, and so they want to read your emails, but a company like Apple, who—you know, Apple doesn’t make money by selling you email service. They make money by selling you an expensive phone. And as long as you keep buying the phones, Apple makes lots of money. For companies like that, where their business model and your privacy are more aligned, I really do think we can expect that these companies will provide us with much stronger and much more secure methods of communication, particularly given that they’re competing in a global market where, you know, German consumers don’t want a phone that can be easily spied on by the NSA. And so, you know, these tech companies really are having to up their game.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, Chris Soghoian, you started in part one of our interview talking about how people can protect themselves. Explain further what people can do.\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: Sure. So, again, the voice and text message services provided by your wireless carrier, if you’re just sending a text message through your phone or making a telephone call through your phone, those calls can be intercepted by your own government, by police and intelligence agencies. They can be intercepted by foreign governments who are operating domestically. They can be intercepted by sophisticated criminals and by hackers and by stalkers. You should not expect that those kinds of communications services can deliver real security.\n\nOn the other hand, there are now a number of apps and Internet-based services that you can run on your smartphone that will give you much, much more secure communications. So, Apple has built iMessage into its iPhone product for several years. If you have an iPhone and you’re sending a text message to someone else who has an iPhone, this is used by default. Those messages are encrypted in a strong way. They’re sent via Apple’s system, and it’s very, very difficult for governments to intercept those. If you’re using WhatsApp, which is a service now owned by Facebook and used by hundreds of millions of people around the world, if you’re using WhatsApp on Android, it’s encrypted, again, in a very strong way. And if you have an Android or iPhone, you can download third-party apps, the best of which are called Signal for iOS and TextSecure, T-E-X-T Secure, from Android. These are best-of-breed free applications made by top security researchers, and actually subsidized by the State Department and by the U.S. taxpayer. You can download these tools today. You can make encrypted telephone calls. You can send encrypted text messages. You can really up your game and protect your communications.\n\nTo be clear, if you are a target of a law enforcement or intelligence agency and they really care about you, they can hack into your phone, and these tools won’t stop that. But you can make it much more difficult. You can make it so that they have to work really hard. And, you know, it’s unfortunate that the phone companies, that AT&T and Verizon haven’t warned their customers. They should be telling the public. They haven’t. But we can do things right now to make wiretapping much more difficult and much more expensive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Is it possible to use a phone without a SIM card?\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: No, the SIM card is sort of like the driver’s license for the phone. The SIM card proves that you have a valid account. That’s, you know, what lets the phone company know who to send the bill to. So, you need a SIM card. You know, think of it this way. When you go to Starbucks, you don’t expect Starbucks to provide you with a secure Internet connection. You expect them to provide you with an Internet connection, and then you bring your own security on top. If you’re using Gmail or Facebook or Twitter, all of those services build their own security in. They don’t rely on the Internet provider to do that for you. By the same token, we should stop relying on the AT&Ts and Verizons of the world to provide security. We should just use them for data, and then we should run secure, encrypted communications apps that go over the data portion of the network. We know how to do this. These apps exist. We can secure our communications. And, you know, it’s been delightful post-Snowden. You know, the journalism community is really starting to take note of this. And I now regularly have encrypted telephone calls with national security reporters around the world. I send encrypted emails with reporters, with lawyers. These tools really are getting to be easy to use, and it’s just—we just need more people to start using them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, explain again, if you just want to make a phone call, but you don’t want it to be listened to or tracked, how would you do that? How would you encrypt a phone call?\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: So, if you have an Apple device, you could download—so FaceTime is already installed in your iPhone. It’s built by Apple. It’s built into the iPhone. If you make a FaceTime audio or video call from your iPhone to someone else’s iPhone or iPad, it’s encrypted with very strong technology, and it will be very, very difficult for a government to intercept. If you have an—if you don’t want to use an Apple encryption product, there’s a fantastic app in the app store called Signal, S-I-G-N-A-L. It’s free. It’s open source. It’s very, very good. That makes encrypted telephone calls anywhere in the world for free. Even if you’re not worried about security, it’s actually a way of saving money on your phone bill. And then if you’re using Android, there’s a great app by the same people who do Signal called RedPhone, R-E-D-P-H-O-N-E. Again, it’s free. It’s supported by the U.S. government. So you’re paying for it anyway; you might as well use it. And that will also let you make free encrypted telephone calls. These tools work, and they make—they make wiretapping much more expensive, which is what we want. We want governments to have to focus their resources on the people that really matter, the real threats, but they shouldn’t be able to spy on everyone at low cost.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I also wanted to ask about another NSA story in the news this week, this new probe that finds the NSA has embedded spying devices deep inside hard drives in computers around the world. The Russian firm Kaspersky Lab says it uncovered the spyware in personal computers across 30 countries, from Iran to Russia, Pakistan, Libya, China, Belgium, Ecuador and the United States. The targets include government institutions, oil and gas firms, Islamic activists, scholars and the media. Can you comment on this, Chris Soghoian?\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: Sure. So, the NSA has a multibillion-dollar budget. They hire some of the best and brightest hackers, and they give these really smart people a lot of resources and basically tell them that they can do whatever they want. And, you know, it’s not surprising that a well-resourced team, that is not constrained by the law, can get up to a lot of really interesting and terrifying things. You know, they’ve been given a mandate by their superiors to go out and hack and get access to every system they can, and they’re doing that. You know, in one way, as someone with a technical background, I’m impressed with what they’ve been able to do. But I think, you know, we should all be very scared about what the NSA is doing, the capabilities they have and the extreme lack of effective oversight that’s taking place. For an agency that is engaged in this degree of highly sophisticated technical compromise of computer systems, the extent to which policymakers and agency overseers lack technical competence, I think, should be terrifying. We need to make sure that those in Congress, those in the courts, who are supposed to perform oversight over the NSA, we need to make sure they have technical understanding or technical advisers. And the fact that there’s no technical oversight of these agencies, I think, is one of the reasons why they’ve been able to do as much as they have with as little oversight.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Chris, why is the government funding the apps that you’re recommending, that make it harder to break into, eavesdrop on texts or calls?\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: Because they’re tools of foreign policy. You know, the U.S. government isn’t this one machine with one person, you know, dictating all of its policies. You have these different agencies squabbling, sometimes doing contradictory things. The U.S. government, the State Department has spent millions of dollars over the last 10 years to fund the creation and the deployment and improvement to secure communications and secure computing tools that were intended to allow activists in China and Iran to communicate, that are intended to allow journalists to do their thing and spread news about democracy without fear of interception and surveillance by—\n\nAMY GOODMAN: But maybe—\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: —the Chinese and other governments.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: But maybe the U.S. government has a way to break in.\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: Well, you know, it’s possible that they’ve discovered flaws, but, you know, they have—the U.S. government hasn’t been writing the software. They’ve been giving grants to highly respected research teams, security researchers and academics, and these tools are about the best that we have. You know, I agree. I think it’s a little bit odd that, you know, the State Department’s funding this, but these tools aren’t getting a lot of funding from other places. And so, as long as the State Department is willing to write them checks, I’m happy that the Tor Project and WhisperSystems and these other organizations are cashing them. They are creating great tools and great technology that can really improve our security. And I hope that they’ll get more money in the future.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And, Chris, very quickly, what’s the legislation you think needs to be passed, at least in the United States, to protect privacy?\n\nCHRISTOPHER SOGHOIAN: I mean, we need so much. We need a technically informed FISA court. We need controls over domestic surveillance. But we also need—we need strict oversight and legislative controls over what NSA does abroad, which right now are largely regulated under Executive Order 12333. Most of the scary things that NSA does, it doesn’t have to go the FISA court to get approval for, and I think we really need to rein that in.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Chris Soghoian, we want to thank you so much for being with us, privacy researcher and activist, principal technologist at the American Civil Liberties Union, also visiting fellow at Yale Law School’s Information Society Project. You can also go back to democracynow.org to see part one of this conversation. I’m Amy Goodman. Thanks so much for joining us.",
  "latent_4931": "Over the last few years, Greater Good—along with many, many other media outlets—has reported frequently on new research suggesting that people of higher socioeconomic status are less generous, less compassionate, and less empathic than others.\n\nNow, a new study says: Not necessarily.\n\nActually, the new findings suggest, higher-income people are less generous only when they live in a place that has high levels of inequality between rich and poor. When the gap between the rich and poor is low, the rich might actually be more generous.\n\nThe study, published online in the prestigious Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, first looked at data from a national survey of about 1,500 United States residents that asked about their household income and home state, among other details. The survey also used a technique that prior research has found effective at measuring generosity: It told respondents that they’d won 10 raffle tickets, then gave them the chance to donate any number of these tickets to another survey respondent who didn’t get any tickets (and whom they’d never meet).\n\nThey found that in states with high inequality, higher-income people were less generous than people who had lower incomes. However, in states with low inequality, the opposite was true: People with higher incomes were more generous with their raffle tickets. In states where inequality was neither especially high nor low, residents’ income was unrelated to their levels of generosity.\n\nThe results raise several questions about what causes what: Is the stinginess of the rich actually responsible for the inequities in states with high inequality? Is it possible that generous people who make a lot of money prefer to live in states with low inequality because that arrangement is consistent with their values? Or is there something about living in an environment of high inequality that makes rich people less generous?\n\nTo address these questions, the researchers ran an experiment in which they manipulated people’s perceptions of inequality in their state. They recruited more than 700 people from across the United States and showed them (fabricated) data about the level of inequality in their state: Some people saw data indicating that their state had especially low inequality, while others saw data indicating that their state had especially high inequality. Then, as in the other study, the researchers told them they’d won 10 raffle tickets (for a $500 prize) and gave them the chance to donate some of those tickets to a stranger.\n\nThe results show that when higher-income people thought they lived in a state with high inequality, they were less generous. But when they were led to believe that their state had low inequality, they were no more or less generous than other people.\n\nThis echoes findings from prior studies suggesting that while rich people might sometimes act less altruistic, they aren’t inherently selfish: When well-off people in those studies were made to feel like they were of lower status, they actually became more generous, and when less well-off people were made to feel like they had higher status, they became more stingy. That suggests there might be something about the experience of elevated power and status that reduces our willingness to give to others.\n\nSo what is it about the experience of living amidst high inequality that might make rich people less generous?\n\nAccording to the authors, one answer might involve a sense of entitlement—“the belief that one is more important and deserving than others”—that high-income people feel when their state’s income is more concentrated in their hands. Those feelings of entitlement and deservingness, they speculate, might help high-income people justify their extreme good fortune to themselves—and may, in turn, reduce their generosity because “people who believe they are more important than others also believe that resources rightfully belong to them.”\n\nThe authors also speculate that high inequality might lead higher-income people to worry more about losing their elevated status and thus hoard their money, because they have further to fall in a highly unequal area.\n\nIn light of these new findings, Robb Willer, one of the study’s authors and a professor of sociology at Stanford University, offers an explanation for why previous studies found that high socioeconomic status reduces generosity: Many of those earlier studies were conducted in California, a state with some of the highest inequality in the country. (The state ranked seventh in inequality, just behind Florida and Louisiana; Washington, DC, had the highest inequality in the country.) Willer says that his team’s findings don’t contradict the prior research as much as offer a caveat to it. What’s more, he says, they provide more targeted prescriptions for public policy.\n\n“If you’re concerned about the relationship between income and generosity,” he says, “one way to counteract that is to adopt policies that promote equality.”",

  "latent_5161": "Erdem Gunduz is a legend. And all he had to do to earn this status was to stand completely still. Gunduz, a performance artist and left-Kemalist, began to stand still in Taksim Square on Monday at 6pm local time. He stood, facing the Ataturk cultural centre, until 2am. It was a silent, stubborn and dignified protest against the brutality of the police response to demonstrators, which had culminated in a sinister weekend assault whose targets included medics and staff who treated the wounded. Indeed, the ministry of health went so far as to threaten to withdraw the licences of medical personnel who treated protesters injured by police.\n\nThe \"standing man\" exemplifies some features of the tradition of passive resistance. First, the ability to meet overpowering physical force with a determined, but passive, feat of defiance has sometimes been the death knell of recalcitrant regimes, whether it is the Shah or Marcos – because it points to resources that the protesters have which can overwhelm the state's repressive capacities. Second, passive resistance is not merely symbolic; it confuses and derails the calculations of the rulers. When the Soviet Union invaded Czechoslovakia, part of the resistance involved painting over street signs and mysteriously shutting off infrastructure.\n\nGunduz's protest was both an affront and a question for the authorities: beat him? Why? He's just standing there. Leave him alone? Then he wins, doesn't he?\n\nAs people began to notice what he was doing, some joined him. Not just in Taksim, but across the country, as far away as Ankara and Izmir. He went viral, acquiring the obligatory hashtag: #duranadam (standing man). Recep Tayyip Erdoğan has been known to complain about the role of social media, particularly Twitter, in these protests. Police even began arresting people for spreading \"untrue information\" on Twitter. The Turkish state has every reason to panic.\n\nSocial media has permitted the viral replication of protest themes, slogans and tactics. Unlike in previous so-called \"Twitter revolutions\", there is mass popular access to social media in Turkey. New York University documented 2m tweets reporting on the protests between 4pm and midnight on one day, Friday 28 May, when the protests went global. Hence the state's panicked attempt to restore its monopoly over truth and falsehood.\n\nThere is perhaps another reason why Gunduz's silent protest resonated, at least for some. The government's response to the protests has, of course, been staggeringly tone deaf. It began by dismissing the protests – complain all you want, we've made up our mind. Then it began violently repressing them, in such a shocking way that it sparked a national revolt. Then it began dumbfoundedly looking for scapegoats. \"Terrorists\", \"drunks\", Twitterers – Erdoğan has blamed the protests on everything except government policy.\n\nThe overarching theme, however, repeated as the prime minister addressed a big pro-government rally in Istanbul, is that the protesters are not really Turkish. Erdoğan's AKP has always been suspect for Turkish nationalists, so is perhaps all the more vehement in its patriotic bluster. The protesters, the government says, are part of a foreign conspiracy, linked to international media manipulation; the real Turkish nation does not bang pots and pans in the evening. Anyone watching the YouTube footage of protesters being hunted through the streets by Turkish police will witness the astounding spectacle of police spraying tear gas while flapping little flags. Gunduz, standing pensively before the image of Ataturk, seems to have a different idea of what is Turkish.\n\nThis is directly linked to the question of official violence which is, of course, the driving force cohering these protests, and – surprisingly, perhaps – a weak point for the government in a number of ways. Despite the fact that the AKP has secured growing electoral majorities since 2002, and fought a largely successful battle against its enemies in the state apparatuses, it never secured that broad popular consensus that would enable it to consolidate its rise.\n\nThe more stable regimes are able to use violence and coercion in ways that conserve their rule. This government has been unable to do so without provoking an existential crisis for itself – arousing a broad, potentially counter-hegemonic alliance of heteroclite elements, from Kurds and leftists to Islamists and nationalists. Its battle for the symbols of national unity, and its attempt to \"other\" the protesters, is symptomatic of this.\n\nThere is another sense in which state violence raises profound questions about the viability of the government. If police violence doesn't quell the uprising, what will? The government has been in nervous talks with selected groups of protesters and quietly made some grudging concessions around Gezi Park – but the protests are about so much more than that now. In desperation, the deputy prime minister, Bülent Arinç, recently threatened to unleash the armed forces against the protesters.\n\nThis would be a staggering move for a government that has based its legitimacy and institutional power to a significant extent on waging a war against the old military elites and especially the \"deep state\". It would give the AKP's old foes a fresh lease of life if they had to be called in to crush the protests, and it's an open question whether the government would survive.\n\nGunduz's moving, motionless protest, is a symbol of great peril for the Turkish regime.",

The ‘Tips gained one point by getting to extra time despite suffering their first loss of the year to stand at 3-0-1-0 heading into Saturday’s matchup against the Portland Winterhawks on home ice.\n\nJust days after arriving in Everett from his time with the Montreal Canadiens, newly-acquired forward Nikita Scherbak scored two goals and added an assist as the ‘Tips battled back from 2-0 and 4-3 deficits in the game. Defenseman Cole MacDonald recorded a goal and assist and Kevin Davis chipped in with two helpers, while Remi Laurencelle picked up his first goal of the season on a penalty shot. Goaltender Austin Lotz (2-0-1-0) stopped 28 of 33 shots in net for Everett.\n\nA fairly even first period saw action on both ends of the ice. The game remained scoreless until Kelowna’s Riley Stadel made a backhand pass to the far side of the net for Tyson Baillie, who redirected it in less than three minutes before intermission. The Rockets were back on the attack late in the period with Austin Lotz down in the crease, but the Everett goaltender made a fantastic blocker-hand save to keep the Silvertips down just one. Shots were 14-12 for the Rockets after the first 20 minutes of play.\n\nTyson Baillie capitalized on a 5-on-3 powerplay for his second goal of the night as Kelowna took a 2-0 lead in the second. The Silvertips got on the board with a powerplay goal of their own late in the period as Nikita Scherbak wired a perfectly-placed wrist shot over the shoulder of goaltender Jackson Whistle from just inside the faceoff circle. Remi Laurencelle was hauled down on a breakaway and awarded a penalty shot just 10 seconds later, sending his shot off the post and in to quickly tie the game at two. After two periods of play Everett edged Kelowna 21-20 on the shot clock.\n\nThe ‘Tips took their first lead during a 4-on-4 situation early in the third when Kevin Davis jumped into the offensive action along with Cole MacDonald, helping create a play that ended with Kohl Bauml centering to Scherbak for a one-timer in the slot that beat Whistle through the five-hole to make it 3-2 Everett. The Rockets tied the game at three as Austin Glover knocked in a rebound and then regained the lead minutes later when Nick Merkley snuck a wrist shot off Lotz. Back on the powerplay just over two minutes later, Cole MacDonald fired a shot from the blueline that was deflected in to tie the game once again at four.\n\nIt took only 24 seconds in overtime for Kelowna to snatch the victory as Cole Linaker drove the net from the right boards and snuck a quick wrap-around shot past Lotz to give Kelowna a 5-4 victory. Final shots were 33-28 for the Rockets. Goaltender Jackson Whistle (5-0-0-0) turned away 24 of 28 shots in net for Kelowna.

  "latent_5250": "Seth Wenig / AP Kevin Clash, the voice and movements behind Sesame Street's Elmo, poses for a picture with Elmo\n\nKevin Clash is an Emmy-award-winning performer and producer with dozens of TV and film credits to his name, but he's far better known as a furry red monster. Clash is the puppeteer and the voice behind Elmo, one of the most popular characters on the seminal children's television show Sesame Street, which this week marks its 40th anniversary with a series of special episodes and a two-disc DVD set, Sesame Street: 40 Years of Sunny Days. Clash spoke to TIME about becoming Elmo, the show's many celebrity guests and why even grown-ups need a Sesame Street fix once in a while. (See TIME's pictures of \"The Ghosts of A Christmas Carol Past.\")\n\nI want to ask how you joined the show and how you came up with what you do with Elmo. The character existed before you joined?\n\nThey had a bunch of monsters and they thought, Wouldn't it be nice to make a red one? So they did. David Korr, who was a writer at the time, really took a liking to the character, and started writing him into the scripts. And of course, then they had to find somebody to puppeteer him. Brian Muehl did it for a couple of shows, and then Richard Hunt. Richard hated it. Richard originated Statler, one of the old guys in the balcony of The Muppet Show; he did Beaker and Scooter. [Elmo] wasn't his type of character; he just thought it was too cutesy and too young.\n\nWas Elmo always deliberately going to be younger?\n\nActually, even when Brian performed him it was this whispery little voice. And then Richard did it, and then he gave him to me. This was one of those lucky days that I was in the Muppeteer greenroom by myself, and he threw it to me and he said, \"Come up with a voice.\" And I said [in Elmo's voice], \"Hi everybody, it's Elmo!\" and he said, \"O.K., fine.\" (See the top 10 Sesame Street moments.)\n\nAt what point did you realize that Elmo was going to turn into such a big deal?\n\nI came back in the next season, and the first bit I did the crew actually laughed. If you can get the crew to laugh on a show, you know that you're doing something. At the end of each season, the producers would get together with the writers and they'll poll what new characters worked that season. And when the research department went out with Elmo, they saw that not only were the kids being entertained by the character, but that they were learning. So they started writing more for the character. And then, of course, the merchandising came into play.\n\nIs it your voice that we hear on the Elmo toys?\n\nYes. I call that job security. Jim Henson always set it up that whoever performs the character will be the voice of the character. So when you hear that voice, that's me. (Watch Elmo face off with comedian Ricky Gervais.)\n\nIs doing Elmo something you can just turn on and off in your head, in terms of entering the character?\n\nA couple days ago [Sesame Street Muppeteer] Caroll Spinney did a radio interview, and he brought Oscar the Grouch. The interviewers were like, \"But nobody can see him.\" Well, we're portraying these characters. We can't just sit there as ourselves and do that voice and personality. We're puppeteers. It's kind of weird for us to sit in front of people, even if it's radio, and not have the puppet there.\n\nDo you know how many celebrity guests there have been on Sesame Street?\n\nI know that James Earl Jones was the first. And now we've had over 400. The most memorable were the ones that come in and have that feel for what the show has meant. I remember when Tracy Chapman came in, she was crying as she sang her song; she was just so overwhelmed by being there. Danny DeVito stood up on the steps so everybody could see him personally thank everybody for all the years that he loved watching the show. I mean, to watch Ray Charles come in and sing the alphabet; to watch Tony Bennett singing \"Slimey to the Moon\"; to sit there with Robert De Niro and have him teach Elmo how to act  where else in this world, on television, could you get that? (See pictures of Sesame Street's 40-year cavalcade of stars.)\n\nThere's a lot more children's television programming these days than there's been before.\n\nAt the beginning of children's programming it was Mr. Rogers, it was Sesame Street, Captain Kangaroo was still on  but that was really it. Now, it's everybody. But Sesame Street has always stood apart. The statistics of how many adults watch the show who don't have children is amazing. I got one letter from a husband and wife who said when they get home and they've had a bad day, they pop in the Best of Elmo video. The guy sent me the cover to sign, to give as a 10th anniversary gift to his wife. I hope that's not the only thing he was giving. But it was really sweet.\n\nWhen you do live events with children and Elmo, do they see you?\n\nSome of the time they do. Most of the time they don't. But I'm telling you, they just see me holding their friend. They don't know me from a hole in the wall and they don't care to.\n\nYou're that guy hanging out with Elmo.\n\nI'm the guy holding their friend. Ever since I've been doing Sesame Street that's been the case. They don't care about us.\n\nRead a brief history of children's television.",
  "latent_5372": "In all the bustle of Cyber Monday and Black Friday, did consumers forget to bring their wallets? You might wonder about that, judging by some reports tracking consumer activity on the traditional launch days of the holiday retail season.\n\nBut the lackluster early gauges aren’t necessarily accurate. And even if sales have been slow in the post-Thanksgiving days, that doesn’t forecast how the overall retail season will go.\n\nMany economists are still predicting a season of sales gains, rooted in an improving overall job market, modest income growth for consumers, and lower gas prices.\n\nDavid French of the National Retail Federation says that reports of a sales dip this weekend, compared with last year, may actually be sign of greater strength in the US economy.\n\n“Folks are a little bit more confident that they don’t have to rush out and get that deal” right on Thanksgiving weekend, said, Mr. French, an NRF senior vice president, said in a Monday appearance on C-SPAN.\n\nThe industry federation has predicted overall holiday sales rising about 4 percent this year, compared with 2013.\n\nYet polling of shoppers done for the NRF suggested that sales fell 11 percent for Thanksgiving weekend, which is typically a vital kickoff moment for holiday shopping.\n\nCould the sales dip be a real sign of trouble?\n\nWell, there have been some not-so-hot signals in the economy. Consumer confidence dipped a bit in a monthly report released just before Thanksgiving. And despite progress in the job market, many Americans still feel stretched thin as the face rising prices for things like food, health care, and college tuition.\n\nSeparately, retailers weren’t helped this weekend by justice-oriented protests that targeted some big malls in the wake of a controversial grand jury decision not to indict a Ferguson, Mo., police officer in the shooting death of a black teen.\n\nBut the reality may be that the NRF survey is both inaccurate and misleading.\n\nA ShopperTrak survey, based on data from retailers, for example, finds a 0.5 percent drop in sales compared with last year. The numbers so far are just for Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday, not for the full weekend.\n\nAnd even if Thanksgiving weekend shopping was slower than retailers hoped for, it may not signal much about holiday season trends.\n\nFrench noted that some retailers start promotions ahead of Thanksgiving, and that consumers may feel comfortable pacing their shopping over the next several weeks rather than scrambling for early deals.\n\nAlso, online sales keep growing as a share of the overall retail market.\n\n“Approximately $1 out of every $7 in holiday retail sales this year is likely to be sourced from online shopping,” US economist Chris Christopher of IHS Global Insight wrote last week in a forecast.\n\nThat would bring online sales to a new high at about 14 percent of holiday sales.\n\nWrapping store-based and online sales together, holiday retail sales will rise 4.2 percent from last year, IHS Global Insight predicts. That would be a better pace than the roughly 3 percent rises seen in 2013 and 2012.\n\nGet the Monitor Stories you care about delivered to your inbox. By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy\n\nThe actual number could end up above or below that forecast, but several trends make economists optimistic.\n\nSince last year, the job market has firmed up, with the official unemployment rate falling below 6 percent of the labor force. Falling gasoline prices free up some money for consumers to spend on other things. And despite the recent dip, consumer confidence has made significant gains.",
  "latent_5613": "Worse, it’s probably turning off many of your on-line friends.\n\nAfter being told for several years by every guru in the business (most of them styled as “social media experts”) that as a writer I must focus my attention on self-promotion through social media, I now consider myself to have become a social media expert myself — at least when it comes to matters writerly.\n\nAnd I am telling you that those other social-media experts (and the publishers that parrot them) are full of crap. When it comes to book promotion, your time is far better spent on other kinds of marketing activities, or even in writing your next novel, than it is being anywhere on social media.\n\nFor about five years I have read books, blog posts, articles and tweets on the subject of book marketing and networking, and I have Facebooked and Tweeted and LinkedIned until my smile, my whistle and my chains have been rattling and ready to fall off. I have examined the situation closely, tracking who comes to my web pages and blogs from where, and who buys my books and when – and what happens to the buzz about other people’s books on social media sites.\n\nAnd here’s the bottom line, my fellow writers: nobody goes on Facebook or Twitter or LinkedIn (or Tumblr or Reddit or even an Amazon forum) to read about your book or mine. They are especially uninterested in our novels. They might possibly be interested in a non-fiction book if they think that what it contains is going to help them somehow (change a tire or make a million dollars or find inner peace), but the creative stuff . . . ? Forget it.\n\nI have only to look within myself to see what should have been obvious five years ago. I’m a writer and an inveterate reader and I never go on those sites to read about new books – in fact, I try to tune out social media messages that have anything to do with books. Such messages are usually boring, and they make me feel guilty because I know I’m wasting my time there, and that I should be working.\n\nThere are good reasons why Facebook, Twitter and LinkedIn are a waste of time for novelists and other creative writers and if anyone had been using their brains they would have figured them out a long time ago. Here they are:\n\nRarely if ever since Gutenberg has anyone ever wanted to read a book because the author said he or she should read it. (Most of us have also never been interested in reading a book just because the publisher told us to read it.) Social media do not alter that reality at all. What readers want to read are books that other people – independent people, whom we respect – tell us we’ll enjoy, not what the books’ authors insist we will enjoy;\n\nMost book-reading folk (i.e., intelligent people) aren’t interested in advertising and promotional copy, or in watching writers pat themselves on the backs for winning awards or getting great reviews. They are interested in discussions and opinions about books. They are interested in two-way exchanges about literary matters – not in one-way communications.\n\nAny Facebook group that is related to writing is as much of a waste of time when it comes to book promotion as is the rest of the site. Most writers don’t buy books from other writers, and those groups are choirs, to which we, their members, sing. Furthermore, Facebook “Pages” devoted to fiction writers don’t seem to do much good. (On a related note of abject honesty: if you are a writer with a blog about your writing, I am probably never ever going to read it. I barely read my own.)\n\nSo if you’re not appealing to me, and I’m not appealing to you (in a way that puts me in mind to buy your book, I mean: you do, of course, appeal to me in every other way), and both of us are writers and readers, what the hell are we doing on Facebook and LinkedIn and Twitter?\n\nWell, we are not working on “self-promotion” as we like to think we are, and as our publishers tell us we are (they really believe it’s true. That’s how much most publishers know about book promotion). What we are doing over there is wasting time – just like everyone else. I like to think of Facebook as the equivalent of the office water cooler, since writing and editing are such solitary activities, and so in a way my visiting there is healthy. I am not arguing with the “social” aspect of social media. In fact, I love it. Too much, most days. :)\n\nAlso, in my opinion (which is rarely humble, as regular readers will know), if all we are doing on Facebook is self-promoting — which is what quite a few writers do – and we are never interesting or funny, we are not only not attracting readers, we are turning them away. I have hidden the posts of several widely published, bigshot authors who are my Facebook “friends” from my F/B news feed because I can’t stand listening to their self-congratulation any more. (As they may well have done with mine!)\n\nAnd as far as Twitter and LinkedIn? The utter lack of interest in novels or writing-related posts on those sites is deafening. In reality, social-media interest in novelists is restricted to only the really major players. The Rowlings, Gaimans, Atwoods and Rushdies may attract attention for what they have to say (which is, please note, not normally related to their books), but nobody gives a damn what the rest of us think, about anything.\n\nWhen I’m on social media sites, I tune out almost everything that has to do with books (aside from industry news and such lovely pages as the one maintained by the Paris Review), and if I am ever looking for a new book to buy or read, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn and Reddit are the last places in the universe I would ever think to go to find out what I might enjoy. (Maybe GoodReads, but maybe not even there. More likely a book reviewing site or a magazine or news publication.) The reason I’m on Facebook is not to locate reading material: I’m there to look at memes, make smart-ass jokes that nobody gets, diss members of the government, read some juicy gossip, find out how my friends are doing, and complain about the phone company. That’s why you’re there too: admit it.\n\nThe take-away from this? As writers, we should focus our promotional efforts on trying to get people to talk about our books (review them, read and recommend them, give them awards, take them to their book groups, write articles or blog posts about them) instead of trying to get people to buy them.",

  "latent_6048": "Adrian Wojnarowski has 1.8 million followers on Twitter, yet the hard-core NBA fans who swarm to his breaking news reports may not know what he looks like. Yahoo Sports’ lead NBA columnist and editor doesn’t have a photo of himself on his account, and he rarely makes an on-camera appearance even in videos for his NBA-focused website, The Vertical.\n\nExpect that to change, soon. Wojnarowski is joining ESPN on July 1, in time for the open of NBA free agency. And in addition to his steadfast newshound reporting, Wojnarowski will have a front-facing role in the World Wide Leader’s TV coverage of the NBA.\n\nWojnarowski spoke Tuesday with For The Win about his new job, which will be formally announced Wednesday morning, and what it means to leave the Yahoo Sports team that he helped bring into mainstream recognition. Above all else, he said to expect the same aggressive reporting and insider access on which he has built his reputation.\n\n“I’m not going to change the way I cover the league,” Wojnarowski said. “But at the same time, being in the studio in Bristol and studio shows in Los Angeles … I’m going to be very visible on all those shows.”\n\nReports of Wojnarowski joining ESPN first surfaced in February but became more concrete in May, shortly after a high-profile round of layoffs. Seven NBA writers were among the layoffs, including lead NBA reporter Marc Stein and NBA Draft reporter Chad Ford, who have stayed on to work for ESPN while under contract, including Stein breaking several major offseason stories over the past two months. Their futures are unclear as Wojnarowski comes aboard.\n\nThe hiring of “Woj” has been in the works for at least six months, however. As For The Win reported last month, the NBA restructuring was believed to be in part to make way for Wojnarowski’s team at The Vertical. Front-office insider Bobby Marks, a former assistant general manager for the Brooklyn Nets whom Wojnarowski calls the “Kristaps Porzingis of my team” because of his versatility and surprising star turn, will join Wojnarowski at ESPN on July 1. Wojnarowski declined to comment on those who remain under contract with Yahoo Sports.\n\nHowever, he did speak at length about his move back to ESPN, where he was a featured columnist a decade ago before joining Yahoo Sports. Wojnarowski is a Bristol, Conn., native (though he plans to stay in New Jersey), and he’s excited to reconnect to his roots. He’s planning to launch a writing program at his high school, Bristol Central, where the English teacher who got him into journalism still works.\n\nMostly, Wojnarowski is excited. ESPN offers him a broader and deeper platform for his breaking news, columns, videos and podcasts. He opened up about his future and past in this 30-minute interview with For The Win.\n\nFTW: What does this move mean for you?\n\nWojnarowski: Well, I’m excited. I’m excited to be a part of the NBA group that they already have and just the commitment that exists to compete at the highest level, to cover the league in a competitive fashion. Their platforms — digital, television, video, social — here, and then globally, I’ve found that this is a sport where there’s a tremendous appetite not just here but all over the world for the NBA. I think ESPN gives you the best platform to reach as many possible people as possible with the best quality of content. There will be an opportunity to reach people and do it in a real committed fashion.\n\nFTW: You built up something at Yahoo in The Vertical, kind of your own creation. Now you’re going to a larger team. I can’t imagine anyone at ESPN has as much editorial freedom as you did at The Vertical. I’m curious how you made the decision that it was in your best interest to maybe give up some freedom to gain reach and other things?\n\nWojnarowski: Well, I’ve always stayed within the structure of where I’ve been. I answered to people at Yahoo. I had tremendous editors, tremendous leaders. I always worked within the structure that we had in place, and I think I’m going to fit well in the structure at ESPN. Top to bottom, there’s a tremendous commitment to the NBA at ESPN. There’s tremendous talent there already covering the league in lots of different ways. I think I fit in well there. I think I fit in well at Yahoo and The Vertical. The structure that exists (at ESPN) here really appealed to me throughout.\n\nFTW: You spent 10 years at Yahoo Sports, and you and Dan Wetzel kind of became the faces of it as it became a big force in sports media out of nowhere. What are you going to miss about that, and what’s your main takeaway from your time at Yahoo?\n\nWojnarowski: None of this would have happened to me without Dan Wetzel. He’s the one who told (former Yahoo Sports leader, now head of USA TODAY Sports Media Group) Dave Morgan 11 years ago, “Hey, we should consider this.” I was a general columnist. I was never a full-time NBA writer. But they were doing things a little differently at Yahoo. They changed my life.\n\nIt’s pretty rare in this business where you can build something from the ground up, and we did that at Yahoo. A lot of people helped put Yahoo on the map as a sports reporting and sports news entity, and I’m proud of it. I’m proud of the time I spent there. It’s a special group. It’ll always be a real special group to me.\n\nFTW: We know what you bring in terms of columns and breaking news, but I guess the TV element is sort of more up in the air in terms of your fit. Do you have specific ideas of what your TV role is going to be and how often you’ll be on programs like The Jump and NBA Countdown?\n\nWojnarowski: My reporting, going on to break news, talk about news, and also interviews. I’ll sit down with people, players, coaches, people from around the league. There will be time to sit down and maybe do longer form television pieces over time. Then the print component will be similar to what I’ve done. I think I’ll be very visible to people on the TV side on all of ESPN’s NBA properties, and SportsCenter and news shows.\n\nFTW: That’s a little bit different from what we expect of you. When you did videos for The Vertical, it was a voiceover, you were not on camera. When you did the live draft and free agency shows, you were not in studio. This is the chance for a lot of people to see you when they didn’t see you as often.\n\nWojnarowski: I have done a lot of — maybe people didn’t see it all — but I did do a couple years on Fox and was in the studio a lot, and even before that I was in the NBC Sports studio. So I’ve had a lot of reps. But there’s no question that for the broader audience, I’ve probably been less visible. But I do understand that’s going to change now.\n\nFTW: Your arrival comes a few months after some major layoffs at ESPN, notably on the NBA side, but also across the board. I know Andy Katz and you go way back. What do those layoffs mean to you, and how to you perceive joining ESPN so soon after?\n\nWojnarowski: Well, listen, I have this tremendous respect for this business, how hard it is, how many talented people in sports, in news, who I came up with in the business. It’s really hard. It’s never been harder. And I have great respect for everybody who’s finding their way and making a living in this business. It’s not easy, and it’s probably not always fair. But at the same time, our industry is changing, and it’s probably going to continue to change. Every company is going through an evolution. So I think you just work as hard as you can to do the best work and hope that there’s going to be opportunities for you. For me, that’s the best way I try to make sense of it all.\n\nFTW: When you talk about the changing industry, how do you view the future of the thing you’re most known for, which is breaking news?\n\nWojnarowski: Well, you’re right in that I’ve tried to be versatile in a lot of ways, but I do understand that’s an element that’s really important for me. I think it’s going to be very important for ESPN. It was important at The Vertical and Yahoo. I think it’s always going to be important. Being able to not just break news first, but to be accurate, to give people context and perspective on breaking news, I do think it has value and it’s going to continue to have great value.\n\nThat means you have to work on that 365 days a year. There are no days off on it, and the market, there’s so many talented people in this at ESPN and at other places who are working really hard at it, too. For me, it’s going to continue to be my top priority. It will be my No. 1 priority at ESPN, and I’ll have other priorities, too, that will fit around it. But it’s something that I’ve worked really hard at, and I’m going to continue to work really hard at because there’s no other way to be competitive in that genre than to just really, really work at it.\n\nThat to me, with all this going on, there’s just a lot of work to be done. And starting somewhere new and making what’s a significant change for me in terms of going there, the one constant is going to be there’s just a lot of work to be done through July and free agency, and then through the fall and the start of another season, and you’ve got to work through it every day. That’s the mindset I’m going to bring, and I know that’s the mindset of the people who are already at ESPN.\n\nFTW: Is there ever going to be a point — obviously, one day in the future, you’ll retire, but before then — where you get tired of breaking news? Where you’re sick of the grind of being up at 2 a.m. because a story’s breaking?\n\nWojnarowski: I love it. I love the speed of it. I love the chase. I love the people I work with and interact with. I’m lucky to be able to do what I do.\n\nMy dad worked at (ball-bearings company) New Departure-Hyatt. Right when New Departure was going out of business in the 1980s, when ESPN was starting to rise, before ESPN, the biggest employer in Bristol was New Departure-Hyatt. It was a factory up on Chippens Hill. He worked hard. He had a real job. So for me to be a couple miles away from that, getting to do this, I don’t think of it as “burned out.”\n\nI’m exhilarated. I’m excited to start there. I don’t see some finish line where I’m trying to stumble to some tape at the end. I feel like I’m sprinting into the job. I love it. I can’t imagine doing anything else. Maybe there will be a time in the distant future, but right now and for the foreseeable future, I can’t wait to get going.\n\nAnd I just consider myself lucky. There’s so many talented people in this industry that I’m lucky I’ve gotten great breaks. I’ve been around people who have given me great opportunities, going all the way back to when I was in high school working at the Hartford Courant. … This is what I always dreamed of. I didn’t imagine this incarnation, it didn’t really exist then. But I’m excited to not just get to work but to keep going. I can’t imagine what else I would do. I don’t golf. I don’t have hobbies. I try to put in the work.\n\nFTW: Is there a change at all for you in working for a league partner, in showing the independent voice you showed at Yahoo?\n\nWojnarowski: I’m going to be a journalist. I’m going to do this job the way I see fit, and I’m going to write and report in the manner in which I’ve done. Nobody has said to me, I have not had one conversation with anybody in this whole process where they’ve asked me to do anything but that. So I’m just going to go into this with that mindset that I’m going to do this job the way I have done it and that ESPN is excited about that.\n\nFTW: In the past, in a couple of your Yahoo columns, you would maybe throw a little turn-of-phrase at ESPN, maybe calling it a “sports cable channel” instead of using the name ESPN. How do you look back on those one-liners that you threw into a handful of columns?\n\nWojnarowski: I mean, I look at it this way: I’m really competitive, and this is a competitive marketplace. And when I’m against you, I’m going against you. When I’m with you, I’m with you. Anybody who’s worked with me knows I’ve been a really good teammate through my years going back to the Fresno Bee with Andy Katz and Bergen Record for nine years, Yahoo for a decade. And I think everyone at ESPN is going to find that I’m a really good teammate and somebody who’s going to be generous with whatever I can be helpful with and competitive with the places that we’re going to compete with.\n\nBut I probably — I’m not perfect, and there’s probably a few times along the line that I probably should have spared everyone or kept to myself. But at the same time, I’m excited to work with the group that’s at ESPN and have Bobby coming in alongside. And whatever else portends in the future, staff-wise, I think there’s a lot of open field to keep getting better, and I’m excited for it.\n\nFTW: You mention your competitiveness, and we ask players this all the time: Do you think of yourself as the best NBA reporter?\n\nWojnarowski: I don’t. I just — this is true — every day I wake up thinking I’m going to get my ass kicked. And some days I do. And some days, I have more success. There’s so much talent and so much diverse kinds of talent, people doing different things, I really just try to stay — it sounds like a player cliché, but really I am very process-oriented and have a way of mapping out my years and mapping out my weeks and what my goals are and places that need my attention. I’ll continue to do that.\n\nI spend all year preparing for the draft, and then free agency, and then the trade deadline, and then the rookie extension deadline in October. Listen, they put a lot of confidence in me at ESPN with what we’re doing, and I’m humbled by it. but I’ve been humbled by the support I had at Yahoo. A lot of people believed in me and trusted in me, and I take it seriously. … You don’t do any of this alone. I had great editors and teammates at Yahoo. And I’m not going to do it alone at ESPN, either.\n\nFTW: Was this inevitable? Was Adrian Wojnarowski going back to ESPN something that had to happen, given that ESPN is the largest sports media organization, or was this something that are surprised by?\n\nWojnarowski: Somewhere in-between. I never felt it was inevitable. The time at Yahoo was, companies change and evolve, and you look at the landscape, and you’re looking for tremendous commitment. The one thing I felt comfortable with at ESPN were the people in place. Like Mary Byrne’s the news editor at ESPN. She and I worked together in Waterbury 23 years, I don’t know how many years, ago, my first job. Then there’s other people I’ve known through the years. And as I got to know the people in there, I became comfortable with their sensibilities and what was important to them and where we aligned on certain things.\n\nSo I always look at it beyond the monolith of the place and into who the people are and how I fit into it. And I don’t know that I fit into it in the past. Maybe I did and didn’t know it, but I think the timing is right and the fit is there, and I felt comfortable with that. Over time, it felt like it fit together. I was very happy at Yahoo, and I loved what we were doing. But there was always a natural — because I grew up (in Bristol) — that there was always a natural (fit). But my father was as surprised as anyone, and he’s lived in Bristol his whole life.",

Deputy Minister of Defense Atanas Zapryanov said the hesitation of some of the pilots was prompted by insufficient flight hours.\n\nIn turn, Defense Minister Krassimir Karakachanov that tensions among the military pilots in Graf Ignatievo were created artificially.\n\nThe BAA statement reads as follows:\n\n“The artificial confrontation created by high-ranking state officials between different army services damages seriously the Bulgarian national security and defense”\n\nThey are convinced that the Minister of Defense and the Air Force Command will do their best to solve as soon as possible the problem of providing regular flawless flights, both in the Graf Ignatievo airfield and in the entire military aviation.\n\nThe statement of aviators has been circulated to the President, the Prime Minister, the Minister of Defense, the Chief of Defense, the Air Force Commander, and the Commander of the Graf Ignatievo airfield.\n\n(Source: BNR | Photo: BGNES)",
  "latent_6112": "Couldn't make it to Dismaland before its rapid shut-down? That's OK. There's always Paris.\n\nJust in time for the COP21 Climate Conference, an organization called Brandalism has hijacked over 600 outdoor ad spaces in the city, replacing them with climate change-related art … and what, at first glance, look like ordinary ads for brands like Total, Air France, Dow Chemicals, GDF Suez and Volkswagen.\n\nThe difference is, these ads reveal unpleasant truths.\n\nAll the targeted brands are corporate sponsors of COP21. (The art also appears in ad space owned by outdoor ad firm JC Decaux, itself an official sponsor.) The objective is to highlight the hypocrisy inherent in those companies associating themselves with an event that their actions suggest they don't really care about.\n\nThe Volkswagen piece below, created by street artist Barnbrook, appropriates the look and feel of classic VW ads but reads, \"We're sorry that we got caught. Now that we've been caught, we're trying to make you think we care about the environment. But we're not the only ones. #redlines #D12 #ClimateGames\"\n\nThe #ClimateGames hashtag refers to what Brandalism calls \"the world's largest disobedient adventure game.\" The ads also include calls to protest the Solutions 21 conference, a corporate expo at Paris' Grand Palais during the COP21; and the hashtag #redlines refers to the minimum changes necessary for a just and inhabitable planet.\n\n\"By sponsoring the climate talks, major polluters such as Air France and GDF-Suez-Engie can promote themselves as part of the solution—when actually they are part of the problem,\" Joe Elan of Brandalism says.\n\nOther targets of the art include heads of state like François Hollande, David Cameron, Angela Merkel, Barack Obama and Shinzo Abi.\n\nBrandalism, a cross between \"brand\" and \"vandalism,\" positions itself as \"a revolt against corporate control of the visual realm.\" It launched in 2012 with the goal of seizing public space back from advertisers. In May 2014, the organization replaced over 360 corporate ad spaces with handmade art from 40 international artists.\n\nFor the COP21, 80 artists from 19 countries tossed their hats into the ring, including Banksy collaborator Paul Insect, Neta Harari and Jimmy Cauty. Many worked on Dismaland, Banksy's 36-day \"bemusement park,\" which appropriated familiar icons like Disneyland characters and placed them in less charming contexts.\n\nThe piece below is a clear echo of that project.\n\n\"We are taking their spaces back because we want to challenge the role advertising plays in promoting unsustainable consumerism,\" says one participating artist. \"Because the advertising industry force feeds our desires for products created from fossil fuels, they are intimately connected to causing climate change. As is the case with the climate talks and their corporate sponsored events, outdoor advertising ensures that those with the most amount of money are able to ensure that their voices get heard above all else.\"\n\nThe ads went up on Black Friday, notable for inspiring consumer stampedes (and resulting deaths), but also because residents here in Paris were forbidden from gathering in public for security reasons this weekend, a result of the terrorist events of Nov. 13.\n\n\"The government has chosen to ban the big civil society mobilizations—but big business events can continue,\" says Brandalism's Bill Posters. \"The multinationals responsible for climate change can keep greenwashing their destructive business models, but the communities directly impacted by them are silenced.\"\n\nOne result of the Parisian lockdown against big gatherings was the cancellation of a planned climate-related demonstration, slated for Sunday. In response, hundreds of Parisians spent the weekend placing shoes in front of, and around, the Place de la République, the public square where most such demonstrations take place.\n\nHere are the shoes–a silent march at Place Republique. Staggering in sorrow and dignity. #climatemarch pic.twitter.com/k7PyXiW3DW — Bill McKibben (@billmckibben) November 29, 2015\n\nThe effort was meant to be a gesture of silent condemnation, with shoes representing those who would have marched on Sunday. Despite this, thousands of demonstrators still gathered to protest in person, creating a human chain along the route of the planned march, leading to a violent clash with police that involved projectiles, baton blows and tear gas. Many chanted, \"A state of emergency is a police state.\"\n\nSome 174 people were jailed and 26 placed under house arrest, owing to individual histories of violence.\n\nThe objective of the protest was to urge leaders to agree to deep emissions cuts, and to help poor countries better manage global warming. In total, some 570,000 people across 175 countries marched on Sunday, says climate change rally organizer Avaaz.\n\nWorld leaders representing 196 different countries are gathering in Paris for the COP21 discussions, including Obama, Hollande and United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. But while the effort looks sincere, the act is perhaps as empty as the event's sponsorship roster.\n\nSecretary of State John Kerry, for example, said this month that the COP21 would not result in \"legally binding reduction targets\"—meaning that even if agreements are made among all parties, it isn't likely they can be enforced.\n\n\"It's now more important than ever to call out their lies and speak truth to power,\" Posters concludes. \"We call on people to take to the streets during the COP21 to confront the fossil fuel industry. We cannot leave the climate talks in the hands of politicians and corporate lobbyists who created this mess in the first place.\"\n\nSee other provocations below.

  "latent_6338": "OK, I get it. Between George W. Bush and Barack Obama we have made complete fools of ourselves on the international stage, outmaneuvered by petty lunatics and crafty kleptocrats like Russia’sVladimir Putin. Some even claim we are witnessing “an erosion of world influence” equal to such failed states as the Soviet Union and the French Third Republic. “Has anyone noticed how diminished, how very Lilliputian, America has become?” my friend Tunku Varadajaran recently asked.\n\nIn reality, it’s our politicians who have gotten small, not America. In our embarrassment, we tend not to notice that our rivals are also shrinking. Take the Middle East — please. Increasingly, we don’t need it because of North America’s unparalleled resources and economic vitality.\n\nWelcome then to the NAFTA century, in which our power is fundamentally based on developing a common economic region with our two large neighbors. Since its origins in 1994, NAFTA has emerged as the world’s largest trading bloc, linking 450 million people that produce $17 trillion in output. Foreign policy elites in both parties may focus on Europe, Asia and the Middle East, but our long-term fate lies more with Canada, Mexico and the rest of the Americas.\n\nNowhere is this shift in power more obvious than in the critical energy arena, the wellspring of our deep involvement in the lunatic Middle East. Massive finds have given us a new energy lifeline in places like the Gulf coast, the Alberta tar sands, the Great Plains, the Inland West, Ohio, Pennsylvania and potentially California.\n\nAnd if Mexico successfully reforms its state-owned energy monopoly, PEMEX, the world energy — and economic — balance of power will likely shift more decisively to North America. Mexican President Pena Nieto’s plan, which would allow increased foreign investment in the energy sector, is projected by at least one analyst to boost Mexico’s oil output by 20% to 50% in the coming decades.\n\nTaken together, the NAFTA countries now boast larger reserves of oil, gas (and if we want it, coal) than any other part of the world. More important, given our concerns with greenhouse gases, NAFTA countries now possess, by some estimates, more clean-burning natural gas than Russia, Iran and Qatar put together. All this at a time when U.S. energy use is declining, further eroding the leverage of these troublesome countries.\n\nThis particularly undermines the position of Putin, who has had his way with Obama but faces long-term political decline. Russia, which relies on hydrocarbons for two-thirds of its export revenues and half its budget, is being forced to cut gas prices in Europe due to a forthcoming gusher of LNG exports from the U.S. and other countries. In the end, Russia is an economic one-horse show with declining demography and a discredited political system.\n\nIn terms of the Middle East, the NAFTA century means we can disengage, when it threatens our actual strategic interests. Afraid of a shut off of oil from the Persian Gulf? Our response should be: Make my day. Energy prices will rise, but this will hurt Europe and China more than us, and also will stimulate more jobs and economic growth in much of the country, particularly the energy belts of the Gulf Coast and the Great Plains.\n\nChina and India have boosted energy imports as we decrease ours; China is expected to surpass the United States as the world’s largest oil importer this year. At the same time, in the EU, bans on fracking and over-reliance on unreliable, expensive “green” energy has driven up prices for both gas and electricity.\n\nThese high prices have not only eroded depleted consumer spending but is leading some manufacturers, including in Germany, to look at relocating production , notably to energy-rich regions of the United States. This shift in industrial production is still nascent, but is evidenced by growing U.S. manufacturing at a time when Europe and Asia, particularly China, are facing stagnation or even declines. Europe’s industry minister recently warned of “anindustrial massacre” brought on in large part by unsustainably high energy prices.\n\nThe key beneficiaries of NAFTA’s energy surge will be energy-intensive industries such as petrochemicals — major new investments are being made in this sector along the Gulf Coast by both foreign and domestic companies. But it also can be seen in the resurgence in North American manufacturing in automobiles, steel and other key sectors. Particularly critical is Mexico’s recharged industrial boom. In 2011 roughly half of the nearly $20 billion invested in the country was for manufacturing. Increasingly companies from around the world see our southern neighbor as an ideal locale for new manufacturing plants; General Motors GM -0.96%, Audi , Honda, Perelli, Alcoa and the Swedish appliance giant Electrolux have all announced major investments.\n\nCritically this is not so much Ross Perot’s old “sucking sound” of American jobs draining away, but about the shift in the economic balance of power away from China and East Asia. Rather than rivals, the U.S., Mexican and Canadian economies are becoming increasingly integrated, with raw materials, manufacturing goods and services traded across the borders. This integration has proceeded rapidly since NAFTA, with U.S. merchandise exports to Mexico growing from $41.6 billion in 1993 to $216.3 billion in 2012, an increase of 420%,while service exports doubled. MeanwhileU.S. imports from Mexico increased from $39.9 billion in 1993 to $277.7 billion in 2012, an increase of 596%.\n\nAt the same time, U.S. exports to Canada increased from $100.2 billion in 1993 to $291.8 billion in 2012.\n\nInvestment flows mirror this integration. As of 2011, the United States accounted for 44% of all foreign investment in Mexico, more than twice that of second-place Spain; Canada, ranking fourth, accounts for another 10%. Canada, which, according to a recent AT Kearney report, now ranks as the No. 4 destination for foreign direct investment, with the U.S. accounting for more than half the total in the country. Over 70% of Canada’s outbound investment goes to the U.S.\n\nOur human ties to these neighbors may be even more important. (Disclaimer: my wife is a native of Quebec). Mexico, for example, accounts for nearly 30% of our foreign-born population, by far the largest group. Canada, surprisingly, is the largest source of foreign-born Americans of any country outside Asia or Latin America.\n\nWe also visit each other on a regular basis, with Canada by far the biggest sender of tourists to the U.S., more than the next nine countries combined; Mexico ranks second. The U.S., for its part, accounts for two-thirds of all visitors to Canada and the U.S. remains by far largest source of travelers to Mexico.\n\nThese interactions reflect an intimacy Americans simply do not share with such places as the Middle East (outside Israel), Russia, and China. There’s the little matter of democracy, as well as a common sharing of a continent, with rivers, lakes and mountain ranges that often don’t respect national borders. Policy-maker may prefer to look further afield but North America is our home, Mexico and Canada our natural allies for the future.

  "latent_6352": "Campaigners say publication of pictures of Doctor Who’s new star naked in previous acting roles is ‘irresponsible’\n\nThe Sun and Mail Online have been accused of being “reductive and irresponsible” after publishing nude photographs of Jodie Whittaker in articles covering the announcement that she is the new star of Doctor Who.\n\nReporting the BBC’s announcement on Sunday that Whittaker would be the first female Doctor, both publications ran articles about Whittaker appearing naked or topless in previous acting work, illustrating the stories with stills.\n\nEqual Representation for Actresses (ERA), a campaign group, said it was surprised and disappointed by the publications’ coverage of Whittaker.\n\nERA said: “We are delighted by the casting of Jodie Whittaker as the 13th Doctor. However, we are surprised and disappointed by the Daily Mail [Mail Online is owned by the Daily Mail and General Trust] and the Sun’s reductive and irresponsible decision to run a story featuring pictures of Jodie in various nude scenes.”\n\nThe Sun published the photographs under the headline “Dalektable” – a reference to the Daleks, an enemy of the Doctor. The article covered pages four and five of the newspaper and described Whittaker’s “saucy screen past”. Mail Online’s article was headlined “Doctor Nude!” and also featured naked and topless photos of previous male Doctors, including Christopher Eccleston, David Tennant and Matt Smith.\n\nThe Sun ran a separate news article welcoming Whittaker’s casting on its front page, while the Daily Mail did not publish the photos in Monday’s edition. The Daily Mirror, Daily Express and Daily Star also published photos.\n\nTheresa May was among those who welcomed the announcement of the first female actor to play the Doctor. Responding to questions about the news, the prime minister’s spokesman said: “She was pleased.” Last year May told the Radio Times that she always tried to watch Doctor Who at Christmas “if possible”.\n\nThe coverage of the BBC’s announcement attracted criticism on Twitter. Ryan John Butcher, the deputy editor of Gay Times, tweeted:\n\nRyan John Butcher (@ryanjohnbutcher) The Sun's take on Jodie Whittaker as the new Doctor is as repugnant as you might expect: \"SHE STRIPPED!

  "latent_6552": "With the Goods and Service Tax (GST) levy on both AC and non-AC restaurants coming down to 5 per cent from today, dining out is expected to get a lot more cheaper. The GST Council, in its 23rd meeting in Guwahati, had slashed the tax rate from 18 per cent to just 5 per cent. However, restaurants will not be able to take the benefit of input tax credit (ITC). Liquor, however, will attract state levies like VAT as it was kept outside the GST regime.\n\nThe new tax structure for restaurants, which is being implemented from November 1, comes days after the Finance Minister Arun Jaitley expressed his displeasure over eateries not passing on the benefit of input tax credit to restaurant-goers. \"All members of the GST Council felt that input tax credit (ITC) to restaurants is not passed on customers. Goods and Service Tax (GST) was being charged on existing rates which put additional tax burden on restaurant goers. Thus, we decided that restaurant industry will not get the benefit of ITC,\" Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said.\n\nIn the 23rd GST Council meet, tax rate for all AC and non-AC restaurants was fixed at 5 per cent. \"Since they did not pass on the ITC benefit to customers, they will not be eligible for the benefit themselves,\" Jaitley had said. Restaurants inside hotels will also levy 5 per cent GST, except in starred hotels where the tariff is Rs 7,500 or more. The rate for restaurants in starred hotel will remain 18 per cent along with the benefit of input tax credit. Outdoor catering will also be taxed at 18 per cent along with ITC.\n\nEffectively, it will be a universal composition scheme in the restaurant sector, said Finance Minister Arun Jaitley had said during a press meet after the Council meet.\n\nMeanwhile, restaurant sector seems discontent with the decision of not getting the ITC benefit. \"The government will be short-changed,\" Rahul Singh, president of National Restaurant Association of India (NRAI) told CNBC TV 18 on Friday. \"The very concept of Input Tax Credit (ITC) is central to GST which is to prevent cascading of taxes,\" Singh had said.\n\nWelcoming the move by the GST Council, the apex industry body said it had sought bringing down GST rate on restaurants to 12 per cent with input tax credit or at 5 per cent without input tax credit. \"We are extremely thankful to the government for making these much required changes in the GST regime. This will help restaurants across India rationalise tariffs,\" FHRAI president Garish Oberoi had said.",

(Photo by Patrick McDermott/Getty Images) Hall of Fame linebacker Sam Huff waves to the crowd as he walks off the field after being honored during a game between the James Madison Dukes and West Virginia Mountaineers at FedExField on September 15, 2012 in Landover, Maryland. (Credit: Patrick McDermott/Getty Images)\n\nLegendary broadcaster Sam Huff announced his retirement from the Redskins radio broadcast Friday, signaling the end of Sonny and Sam after 31 memorable years.\n\n“I’ve enjoyed every game that I played, coached and provided color commentary over the last 50 years with the Washington Redskins,” Huff said, via a press release from the Redskins Radio Network.\n\nHuff’s broadcast career began with the Redskins in 1975, six years after the conclusion of his 13-year Hall of Fame playing career with New York and Washington.\n\nIn 1981, Huff was paired with former Redskins quarterback and fellow Hall of Famer Sonny Jurgensen. The two would call games side-by-side for the next 31 years, with generation after generation being raised on the voices of “Sonny and Sam.”\n\nThey’d broadcast alongside various other voices throughout their time together, most notably Frank Herzog, who led the duo with play-by-duties until 2004, before being replaced by Larry Michael, and with the addition of Rick ‘Doc’ Walker in 2002.\n\n“Although Sam’s commentary duties will change, he will always be part of our Redskins family,” Redskins owner Daniel Snyder said. “And we look forward to his future contributions on Washington Redskins broadcasts.”\n\nHuff was reluctant to have his broadcast schedule shortened last season, when the team announced he’d only be a part of home broadcasts and road trips to Dallas and New York.\n\n“If I’m not a part of it, I don’t want to see it,” Huff told 106.7 The Fan in 2012. “Sometimes people think they can do better without you than they can with you.”\n\nNeedless to say, his time on our radios will be forever memorable, and his inclusion as part of the Redskins family, to fans at least, will be eternal.\n\n“I look forward to joining Larry, Sonny and Doc on the pre-game show a few times this season,” Huff said in the release.\n\nFollow 106.7 The Fan on Twitter.",
  "latent_6698": "The following is a psychochronography — to use Philip Sandifer’s wonderful term — of Doctor Who, particularly those episodes aired from 1990-2004. This is my favorite part of the show — partially because it is so controversial, partially because most of the hardcore Secret Masters of Fandom want to forget it exists. I’m sure when I link this to /r/gallifrey there will be a large brawl. I may even get banned. It’s funny…the looms are addressed, as is the concept of canon. But you’d think that would please someone…\n\nAnyway, here goes.\n\nIt is September 24, 1990. The year has been momentous. The Hubble Space Telescope has been launched, the Human Genome Project has begun in earnest, Germany has been reunified, Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait. Total Recall, Ghost, Dances With Wolves, Home Alone and Misery, among others, have been released in theatres.\n\nToday, Mikhail Gorbachev has been given power to usher the Soviet Union into its future as a market economy. “Release Me” by Wilson Phillips is the Billboard #1 single. The future is here and it is marked by things falling apart. The song remains the same, though…over-synthesized kitsch in search of meaning and love.\n\nThe computer-animated face of Sylvester McCoy winks at us (what did they do that on? An Amiga? It looks terrible in this lovable way) and we’re off, past bad chrome lettering and a starfield. Just like always. There was some worry that the BBC would finally give the show its walking papers this year…that there would at last be nothing at the end of the lane. And maybe that’s not quite true…maybe it’s too early to be thankful.\n\nWe were promised the Cartmel Masterplan. To sum up, in fan conventions and DWM alike, Andrew Cartmel, the showrunner for Season 27, has explained this as a look into the Doctor’s past following on the events of Season 26. The Doctor, we are told, is actually the Other — one of three architects, along with Omega and Rassilon, of Time Lord society. Perhaps even of the universe itself. The Masterplan tells us he’s more than just another Time Lord. It’s been decried by some as a hackneyed backstory, a dark and gritty 90s reinvention, a bad Alan Moore pastiche. Others suspect it would have been a fascinating new direction.\n\nThere’s only one problem.It’s not here. Neither is Ace. Where they’ve gone is not explained. David Tennant once said he almost quit watching over this episode. Andrew Cartmel always hedges about what exactly…happened…he implies nothing did. But the Masterplan is conspicuously absent. No one acknowledges Ace is gone. Diegetically and mimetically, there is nothing at the end of the lane.\n\nIn fact, what’s fascinating about this episode is the amount of things it doesn’t do. It’s only fifteen minutes, of course, but the amount of formlessness is staggering even for the sometimes clunky late 80s-early 90s era of Who storytelling. One almost suspects that Ian Briggs is taking the piss — in the same way that Curse of Fenric played with all the story elements that make Doctor Who definably Doctor Who and turned them up to 11, prefiguring Doctor as Odin, Doctor as Face of the 20th Century, and Doctor as tightrope between man and Great Old One; Perdita plays with the very structure of Who. It begins manageably enough, with our intrepid but doddering hero meandering a lonely street. Probably Shoreditch somewhere. It’s obvious location footage..you’ll probably have to turn your speakers down if you have a decent audio setup. The usual badly mixed hiss from this time period is menacing. There are almost whispers…but that’s just because you can’t hear anyone else. The audio is just bad. Here’s a bit of McCoy’s breath on the mic — he’s fumbling today. Was the price of continued Who a draft take? He really seems like he’s less all there than he was in the ’98 feature film.\n\nNow there’s a black and white title card. I half expect it to say “Sam Becket never made it home”. But it reads instead “Et In Arcadia ego”. There is no period. They can’t even get that right.\n\nI’m sorry. I don’t mean to be critical. We’ve all seen it. It is that bad. Redacted almost, surreal…there’s nothing there and it hurts to watch. In a 2008 Reddit AMA, Paul Cornell suggested that this was intentional. Andrew Cartmel is not that smart. “Things happen when you travel alone…we’re all stories in the end..” These are Moffat tropes from the new series. The fucking reboot! They don’t matter to this except as a method of backforming our understanding of the…incomprehension on our screens. Doctor Who is about to go full Max Headroom.\n\n*breathes* My tea is getting cold. There. Better. You know, that’s a good way of getting a handle on this…mess. It’s almost like a broadcast intrusion got made into a script. You’re watching a music video…but there is no music. Haunting strains of a synthesizer, maybe, but they’re indistinguishable from the ambient noise of the TARDIS console room. Speaking of which, this is a hell of a bottle show. The one Cardiffstan street, then the Tardis. Which has been covered with a thin aluminum foil, trying to look chrome, maybe silver. The Doctor stumbles around it. Cosmic rays enter the room. I can tell they’re cosmic rays because they look like visual afterimages and pass through walls. It’s a remarkably good special effect…the team responsible must have read up on the Apollo astronauts’ description of the phenomena. Now the color’s all washed out…he’s angry.\n\n“The question is not who I am.” He looks frantically from side to side. There are…weird…what look like shadowy people facing the wall. On his left, a reddish-brown haired girl. On his right, a dusty blonde woman. They don’t speak. Is this an attempt to depict hallucinations? “Who I am shall burn my hand in this moment, as all moments. I AM THE OTHER! I am that which…that which…fascinating. I’m manic. It has been a while.”\n\nHe strides into the center as a spotlight descends. “In this moment, June 27. 2016, 11:23 PM, I must decide what that means. No one can help me. I wander in the wilderness. What shall I be? For Who can never be answered and I must make peace with that despair.” This is so oddly specific about irrelevant nonsense and overwritten it’s almost funny. But it doesn’t feel right. Phil Sandifer won’t even write about this shit. He uses the alternate fanon timeline. I’m almost beginning to suspect we repressed this…\n\nHe points the sonic screwdriver toward the blond girl, looking at the auburn one. “What must I do?”\n\nThe episode ends here, the familiar sound effects not so much a comforting presence as a stomach-curdling drop into terror and the unknown. Nothing at the end of the lane indeed.\n\nBohemia doesn’t even have a coastline, y’know. Stay tuned for Episode 2 of this serial…October 1, 1990. In the meantime…\n\nexit stage left, pursued by a bear.\n\nAdvertisements",

AP Photo/Craig Ruttle\n\nAs Democratic leaders increasingly begin to lend their support to the \"Occupy Wall Street\" protests, the Republican National Committee (RNC) is targeting those who have supported the movement for a lack of \"outrage\" over a string of alleged anti-Semitic incidents that have recently been reported at the protests.\n\nIn a memo on Tuesday, the RNC's Sean Spicer writes that Democratic leaders who have come out for \"Occupy Wall Street\" (OWS) have \"been silent\" when it comes to \"protestors' extreme anti-Semitic, anti-Israel comments.\"\n\n\"Where's the outrage?\" he asks. \"While protestors are seen spewing hate against Jewish Americans, President Obama, Nancy Pelosi, and DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz have declared their support for the demonstrations. Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Chair Steve Israel even circulated a petition saying he's 'standing with' Occupy Wall Street.\"\n\nA handful of conservative blogs and Jewish organizations have recently pointed to anti-Semitic incidents at the Wall Street protests - most recently in the form of a video put out by the Emergency Committee for Israel (ECI), among whose board members include former presidential candidate Gary Bauer and conservative columnist Bill Kristol.\n\nThe video shows protesters making disparaging and offensive comments about and/or directed at Jews, including one man's cry that \"Jews control Wall Street.\"\n\n\"Why are our leaders turning a blind eye to anti-Semitic, anti-Israel attacks?\" the narrator in the ad intones. \"Tell President Obama and leader Pelosi to stand up to the mob. Hate is not an American value.\"\n\nThe Anti-Defamation League (ADL), which fights anti-Semitism in America and abroad, has also called on OWS organizers to condemn the remarks - but the organization has noted that the incidents do not appear to be widespread or characterize the protests.\n\n\"I really don't see any endemic anti-Semitism at these rallies at all. Anybody can show up at these things,\" said Oren Segal, director of the organization's Center on Extremism, in the Jewish Week.\n\nADL National Director Abraham Foxman noted in a statement that \"There is no evidence that these anti-Semitic conspiracy theories are representative of the larger movement or that they are gaining traction with other participants.\"\n\nJesse Ferguson, a spokesperson for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, argued in a statement that the calls of anti-Semitism had been \"discredited\" and that Republicans were using the issue as a \"distraction\" from the real issues at play.\n\n\"We're not going to listen to lectures on anti-Semitism from the same Republicans who continue to stand behind one of their biggest donors, the Koch Brothers, doing business with the Iranian regime that threatens Israel's very existence,\" said Ferguson, referencing reports tying the Koch brothers to business deals with Iran.\n\n\"Republicans are casually throwing around discredited accusations of anti-Semitism against top Jewish leaders in an attempt to distract from the fact that hundreds of thousands of Americans are rightfully angry about Republican economic policies that led to lower home values and incomes, fewer jobs and weaker retirement savings.\"",
  "latent_6788": "During the Lucasfilm: The Art of Storytelling presentation at Star Wars Celebration Europe 2016, it was quickly and quietly mentioned that the Lucasfilm Story Group is not only working on the future of Star Wars movies, but also the future of the Indiana Jones series. What does this mean for the future of Indiana Jones stories? Could we get a multi-platform Indiana Jones universe?\n\nThe mention came as ILM President Lynwen Brennan was talking about the future of Lucasfilm and how the Lucasfilm Story Group have been planning long-term storylines for Star Wars that will be experienced by fans across many different platforms, not just movies and games but VR, books, comics television and more.\n\nKiri [Hart] and her group have mapped out a story and timeline across multiple platforms many years in advance, many EXHAUSTING years in advance. … We have a great honor to have responsibility for, so we want to be really careful with that. Not only for Star Wars but with Indiana Jones, which we’re all really excited about as well.\n\nWhen Disney acquired Lucasfilm, it was first thought that Indiana Jones was not part of the equation. The Mouse House later acquired distribution and marketing rights from Paramount and it was revealed that director Steven Spielberg was developing Indiana Jones 5. Even though initial rumors and reports claimed that Disney wanted to recast Indiana Jones with a younger star, it has since been confirmed that Harrison Ford will reprise his iconic role for the fifth film.\n\nBut it now sounds like Lucasfilm is planning for a long future for this franchise, that like Star Wars, will be connected across many different platforms. So the question is how do they do that? Star Wars is a franchise based within a universe while Indiana Jones is a franchise that focuses on one character. So its hard imagine they are planning for a cinematic universe in the same sense of what Marvel Studios has been doing, but telling different Indiana Jones adventures from different time periods across a multitude of mediums.\n\nNot to say a cinematic universe in the traditional sense wouldn’t be possible. They could expand to do films on multiple characters, like imagine a standalone story following Marion Ravenwood or the younger adventures of Henry Jones Sr.But I’m not sure if audiences are interested in that — Indiana Jones is the the selling point of these adventures.\n\nI can’t imagine that Disney won’t recast Indiana Jones at some point, if not after this fifth film than as part of this fifth adventure. I’ve always liked the idea of having the story half set in the past with a new actor taking on the role and in the current timeline with Harrison Ford as an older Indiana Jones, and the story somehow bridging the gap between the two parallel adventures.\n\nThere are definitely a lot of cool Indiana Jones stories that could be told, not just in future films but other mediums. Previously George Lucas told some Indiana Jones stories in comics, novels, television and video games, but they never seemed to be taken too seriously by fans and I’m sure Disney would classify those stories as “Legends” if they do take this approach. I’m most excited about what ILMxLab might do with the character, not just for virtual reality experiences that put you in the middle of the adventure (imagine being put inside a booby-trapped temple) but experimental storytelling beyond our current expectations.",
  "latent_6973": "During the past couple of weeks, Donald Trump has led the media in a merry dance, turning the workings of a transition team and staffing of an Administration into a television reality show, complete with elaborately staged auditions at real-world locations (Trump Tower, Trump National Golf Club), public humiliations (Chris Christie), and surprise appearances (Eva Moskowitz, Mitt Romney). Meanwhile, Trump has said next to nothing about one of the most pressing questions he faces: What does he intend to do with his far-flung business interests and the glaring conflicts of interest they potentially represent?\n\nOn Monday, the issue came into public view when an Argentine journalist reported that Trump, during a courtesy call last week with Argentina’s President, Mauricio Macri, had asked the Latin American leader to help facilitate the construction of a Trump Tower in Buenos Aires. After the report caused a furor on social media, a spokesman for Macri insisted that it was \"absolutely untrue,\" adding, “They talked about maintaining the relations between the countries. . . . They didn’t talk about the tower at all.”\n\nWhatever Trump did or didn't say to Macri, the incident illustrated some of the dangers that are in store for the President-elect, and the country, if he sticks with his declared intention of making only the most cursory of moves to separate the business of America, Inc., from the business of Trump, Inc. During the campaign, Trump said that, if elected, he would hand over the running of the Trump Organization to three of his children: his two sons, Eric and Donald, Jr., and his eldest daughter, Ivanka. Some observers initially described this arrangement as a \"blind trust,\" but legal experts quickly pointed out that it would be neither blind (Trump would be well aware of the identity of his businesses) nor a trust (the people running it wouldn't be independent from Trump).\n\nLast week, a spokesperson for the Trump Organization said the family was “in the process of vetting various structures,” and insisted that whatever arrangement they settled on would \"comply with all applicable rules and regulations.” But this was yet another empty statement. For historical reasons, Presidents are exempted from many of the conflict-of-interest laws that apply to other federal officeholders, such as Cabinet members.\n\nThis exemption dates back to the earliest days of the Republic, when Presidents tended to be wealthy plantation owners with large holdings of land and slaves. The Founding Fathers were well aware that men of this ilk would see their fortunes affected by some of the policies that the federal government would pursue, such as those relating to agriculture and tariffs. Rather than forcing a President to recuse himself from dealing with these issues, or to sell off his holdings, they decided to cut him some slack. Early Congresses went along with this arrangement, which survives to this day. \"Because the president of the United States is the single most consequential decision maker on the planet, Congress has decided his hands shouldn’t be tied on any issue because of conflicts of interest over any potential financial or personal gain,\" Norman Eisen, a former ethics counsel to the Obama Administration, who is now a fellow at the Brookings Institution, told the Wall Street Journal earlier this year.\n\nThis reasoning must have been sweet music to Trump's ears when it was explained to him. He evidently still intends to transfer managerial control (but not necessarily ownership) of his businesses to his kids. And rather than make any real break with his interests, he’ll leave things at that. Which means that every time President Trump deals with a country that contains a business with his name attached to it, there will be questions about whose interests he is really looking out for.\n\nThese questions will be incessant. According to an analysis of public financial filings that the Washington _Post _published over the weekend, \"At least 111 Trump companies have done business in 18 countries and territories across South America, Asia and the Middle East.\" Trump owns some of these enterprises, such as various golf courses in Scotland and Ireland, either by himself or with partners. Many of his other interests are licensing arrangements, in which local businessmen—real-estate developers, usually—have paid to use the Trump name. Along these lines, there is a Trump Tower Mumbai, a Trump Towers Istanbul, and a Trump Tower Punta del Este, on the coast of Uruguay.\n\nAnd as my colleague Adam Davidson pointed out a few days ago, the Trump business empire is now expanding rapidly. \"The firm added three new hotels, in Washington, D.C., Canada, and Panama, during the year and is looking at opportunities in the Dominican Republic, London, Frankfurt, Munich, Amsterdam, and Tel Aviv,\" Davidson wrote. \"In Asia, a hotel and residential complex in Bali, Indonesia, is under way. ... Buildings with his name in Baku, Azerbaijan, and Istanbul have faced some problems, but the company is undaunted.\"\n\nOnce you grasp the geographical spread of Trump's interests, it is hard to see how the potential conflicts of interest could ever be resolved. Take the Middle East, a region of the world that every modern American President has had to focus on. According to the Post, in addition to the Trump-branded real-estate development in Turkey, Trump has business ties to Qatar and the United Arab Emirates, two oil-rich countries that have funded radical Islamic movements. And, just last year, Trump registered eight companies named after Jeddah, the second-largest city in Saudi Arabia.\n\nIt's not just that Trump won’t be seen as an honest broker in the Middle East. He wouldn't be seen as broker of any kind but as a principal and business partner of some of the region's repressive governments and their cronies. Even if, for the duration of his Presidency, Trump were to put his businesses into a properly independent trust, run by business executives not connected to him, the Trump-owned and Trump-branded companies would still be generating income for the President and his family. He and his advisers would know that. The governments of the countries where the companies are located would know that. And so would the rest of us.\n\nAs far as I can see, there are only two ways out of this conundrum. One would be for Trump to decide that he doesn't want the job of President after all, and let Mike Pence do it. The other option is for Trump to sell off his businesses and put the money raised into a bank account, U.S. Treasury bonds, or a genuinely blind trust, which wouldn't inform him about what investments it had made.\n\nLate last week, a number of good-government groups and government-ethics lawyers issued a public letter that called on Trump to follow the latter course. \"We understand that this arrangement would require you to sever your relationship with the businesses that bear your name and with which you have invested a life’s work,\" the letter said. \"But whatever the personal discomfort caused, there is no acceptable alternative—and your duties to the American people now must prevail over your personal ties to the Trump Organization businesses.\" One of the letter's signatories was Norm Eisen. Another was Common Cause, an organization whose vice-president of policy and litigation said, in a statement, \"Turning your businesses over to your children is what leaders of Banana Republics do. Americans expect and deserve better from the Trump Administration.\"\n\nTrump and his advisers will be tempted to shrug off these demands as the work of Democrats and other ill-wishers. They may have more difficulty in dismissing the views of the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal, a very influential voice in Republican circles. \"Mr. Trump’s best option is to liquidate his stake in the company,\" an editorial in the Journal said on Friday. And it went on: \"If Mr. Trump doesn’t liquidate, he will be accused of a pecuniary motive any time he takes a policy position. . . . Along the way Mr. Trump could expose himself to charges, however unfair, that he is violating the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which prohibits public officials from accepting gifts or payment from foreign governments.\" In conclusion, the editorial said, \"The presidential stakes are too high for Mr. Trump to let his family business become a daily political target.\"\n\nThat will be the reality facing Trump if he ignores the advice to liquidate his holdings—and it will be a perfectly justified reality. The choice is his, and he seems determined to brazen it out. \"Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world,\" he said Monday night on Twitter. \"Only the crooked media makes this a big deal.\"",

  "latent_7104": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nOne day last November, a group of teenage girls dressed in long khaki skirts and modest blouses stepped onto the stage at an Independent Fundamental Baptist church in Maryland where Jeannie Marie (a military spouse who asked that her last name not be used) attended services with her family. The young women, visitors from a Missouri girls’ home called New Beginnings Ministries, sang old-time hymns, recited Scripture, and gave tearful testimonies about their journeys out of lives of sin. Headmaster Bill McNamara spoke, too, depicting the home as a place where girls could get on track academically, restore broken relationships, and learn to walk with God.\n\nNew Beginnings describes itself as a character-building facility for “troubled teens,” and what Jeannie Marie heard in church that day was that this might be a place for her daughter to heal. While jogging earlier that year, the 17-year-old (whom I’ll call Roxy) had been pulled into a vehicle and assaulted by a group of men. Since then, she had begun acting up at home, as well as sneaking out and drinking. Two weeks after seeing the girls in church, Jeannie Marie and her husband left Roxy in McNamara’s care with the promise that she would receive counseling twice a week and stay at New Beginnings no longer than two months. “It sounded like a discipleship program,” Jeannie Marie recalls. “A safe place where a daughter can go to have time alone to find God and her direction.”\n\nInstead, Roxy found herself on the receiving end of brutal punishments. A soft-spoken young woman, blonde and blue-eyed with a bright smile, Roxy confided to me that she found it easier to discuss her ordeal with a stranger than with the people closest to her. She told me how, in her first weeks at the academy’s Missouri compound—a summer-camp setup in remote La Russell, population 145—she and other girls snuck letters to their parents between the pages of hymnals in a local church they attended, along with entreaties to congregants to mail them. When another girl snitched, Roxy said, McNamara locked some girls in makeshift isolation cells, tiled closets without furniture or windows. Roxy got “the redshirt treatment”: For a solid week, 10 hours a day, she had to stand facing a wall, with breaks only for worship or twice-daily bathroom trips.\n\nShe was monitored day and night by two “buddies,” girls who’d been there awhile and knew the drill. They accompanied her to the shower and toilet, and introduced her to a life of communal isolation and rigid discipline. Girls were not allowed to converse except from 6 to 9 p.m. each Friday. They were not allowed contact with their families during their first month, or with anyone else for six months. By that time, Roxy said, most girls are “broken,” having been told that their families have abandoned them, and that the world outside is a sinful, dangerous place where girls who leave are murdered or raped.\n\nThe girls’ behavior was micromanaged down to the number of squares of toilet paper each was allowed; potential infractions ranged from making eye contact with another girl to not finishing a meal. Roxy, who suffered from urinary tract infections and menstrual complications, told me she was frequently put on redshirt, sometimes dripping blood as she stood. She was also punished with cold showers, she said, and endless sets of calisthenics after meals.\n\nBack in Maryland, Jeannie Marie was unaware of her daughter’s plight. Her letters went unanswered—only one of Roxy’s replies got past the academy’s censors. Getting through by phone also proved challenging, and calls were monitored. A billing dispute with New Beginnings’ staff didn’t make things any easier. It was two months before she and her husband could arrange a conference call with Roxy and the staff. They asked Roxy if she wanted to come home. Surrounded by her disciplinarians, the girl replied that she had to stay—that New Beginnings was good for her. The call dissolved into a shouting match between Jeannie Marie and McNamara—who finally declared that he would only discuss the matter with her husband.\n\nWhen I phoned New Beginnings to ask about the family’s allegations, a staffer referred all questions to Wesley Barnum, the academy’s attorney, who did not return my repeated calls.\n\nA week or so after the disastrous conference call, Jeannie Marie traveled to La Russell with a friend who’d heard about places like New Beginnings—sketchy teen homes drawn by Missouri’s laissez-faire policy toward faith-based residential facilities. Authorities in the state are barred from inspecting the homes or even keeping track of them. (New Beginnings has operated under multiple names in Florida, Mississippi, and Texas.) “It’s hard to understand it, but faith-based is just taboo for regulation,” says Matthew Franck, an editor at the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, who authored an investigative series on the state’s homes in the mid-2000s. “It took decades of work to get just the most minimal standards of regulation at faith-based child-care centers,” he adds. “I just knew that when certain lobbyists would stand up to say, ‘We have a concern about how this affects faith-based institutions,’ the bill was immediately amended—it was a very Republican legislature—or it would immediately die. That’s still true.” (Missouri isn’t alone. In April, Montana state Rep. Christy Clark, who campaigned on a “faith and family” platform, joined 11 other Republicans in scuttling a bill that would have regulated religious teen homes; a mother of three, she cast the homes’ residents as unreliable witnesses who “struggle with truthfulness.”)\n\nWhen Jeannie Marie arrived at New Beginnings, she had a tense conversation with the school counselor, who insisted that Roxy wanted to stay. She extracted her daughter nonetheless. The school’s effects on Roxy were striking, Jeannie Marie told me. When they stopped at a restaurant on the way home, she robotically asked for permission to speak or to use the bathroom. After months of punitive mealtimes, including five-minute “force feeding” sessions for girls on redshirt, she wolfed her food. Back in Maryland, she showed signs of an eating disorder, self-destructive behavior, and severe depression. “I was only there for three months,” Roxy said, “but because we weren’t allowed to keep track of time, it felt like six.”\n\nDesperate for a way out, she’d attempted suicide—many of the girls did, she added nonchalantly, if only for the chance to get taken to a hospital and beg for outside help. “They take away any feeling that you are capable of doing anything outside the home,” she said. “You have this sense of total isolation: There’s no way out of it, you’re there for the rest of your life.”\n\nNew Beginnings is emblematic of an unknown number of “troubled teen” homes catering to the Independent Fundamental Baptist community—a web of thousands of autonomous churches linked by doctrine, overlapping leadership, and affiliations with Bible colleges like Bob Jones University. IFB churches emphasize strict obedience and consider teen rebellion an invention of worldly society, so it’s little surprise that families faced with teenage drinking, smoking, or truancy might turn to programs promising a tough-love fix. Fear of government intrusion—particularly on account of the community’s “spare the rod, spoil the child” worldview—is so pervasive that IFB congregations are primed to dismiss regulatory actions against abusive facilities as religious persecution.\n\nNew Beginnings and numerous other Christian reform schools trace their lineages to Texas radio evangelist Lester Roloff, who founded the Rebekah Home for Girls in Corpus Christi back in 1967, employing disciplinary tactics that were adopted by dozens of imitators. He also pioneered girls’ singing groups as a way to promote Rebekah Home—the “Honeybee Quartet” was featured in his daily revivalist radio broadcasts. But back at the hive, Roloff’s wards were often subjected to days in locked isolation rooms where his sermons played in an endless loop. They also endured exhaustive corporal punishment. “Better a pink bottom than a black soul,” Roloff famously declared at a 1973 court hearing after he was prosecuted by the state of Texas on behalf of 16 Rebekah girls. (The attorney general responded that he was more concerned with bottoms “that were blue, black, and bloody.”) Later that year, a former student testified that a whipping at Rebekah Home left inch-high welts on her body.\n\nThe “bowel and bladder torture” consisted of girls being given bran, made to drink lots of water at breakfast, and then denied bathroom access until lunch.\n\nIn a 1979 standoff that would become the stuff of fundamentalist folklore, Roloff declared his cause “the Christian Alamo,” organizing hundreds of supporters into barricades to keep state officials off his compound. The ensuing church-state battle outlived Roloff, who died in a plane crash in 1982. The home relocated to Missouri three years later, returning to Texas in 1998 after then-Gov. George W. Bush deregulated the activities of faith-based groups there.\n\nRebekah Home eventually closed, and New Beginnings opened in Florida soon after, under the watch of a couple who had worked with Roloff for 35 years. They were Wiley Cameron (who later served on Bush’s peer-review board for Christian children’s agencies in Texas) and his wife Faye (who was banned from working with children in the Lone Star state). Bill McNamara and his wife eventually took over, and when state officials began investigating the home, they moved New Beginnings to Missouri. “Because I used to listen to [Roloff] on the radio, and read about the great girls coming out of his place, I thought maybe this was God’s thing for Roxy,” Jeannie Marie remembers. “I didn’t know to do deeper research, because, I thought, these are Baptists, these are my people.”\n\nThis past February, parents at Amelia Academy, a Virginia Christian day school with no IFB affiliation, made an unpleasant discovery: One of the teachers had been accused by former students at the New Bethany Home for Boys and Girls—a Roloff-inspired facility in Louisiana—of participating in physical punishments decades earlier. After a heated school-board meeting where parents demanded an investigation, Amelia headmaster George Martin went online to solicit stories from New Bethany alumni. (A criminal background check came back clean, and the teacher, who denied abusing any children, remains at Amelia.)\n\nOne of the students Martin contacted was Teresa Frye, now a 43-year-old mother of four. She told me of her upbringing in North Carolina, where an IFB preacher named Mack Ford occasionally visited her church. He would arrive with a school bus full of teenagers from his girls’ home in Arcadia, a Louisiana town of 2,700. They made a striking presentation—young women in white blouses or dresses, with lovely voices, singing and offering dramatic testimonies. They spoke of living as prostitutes and drug addicts before finding salvation at New Bethany, where they now rode horses and studied the Bible. Churchgoers emptied their wallets, pouring out “love offerings” to sustain Ford’s mission.\n\nInterviews with a half-dozen former students indicate that most of the girls were merely “rebellious” teens—like Frye, who at age 14 began resisting her strict Baptist parents. In 1982, they sent her to New Bethany, and her 10-year-old sister followed soon after. The girls found themselves at a remote compound bordered by a rural highway and ringed with barbed wire. There was no horseback riding. Their studies consisted of memorizing Scripture (mistakes were punishable by paddling) and a rote Christian curriculum. Discipline ranged from belt whippings to being forced to scrub pots with undiluted bleach or—in the years after Frye attended—wearing painfully high heels for weeks on end, or running in place while being struck from behind with a wooden paddle, according to alumni.\n\nThen there was the “big sister treatment”—established students, directed by staff, inflicting punishments on the newbies. “It was basically like in the military, where they do a ‘blanket party,’ throwing a blanket over your head, and your teammates beat the crap out of you to make you get back in line,” says Lenee Rider, a New Bethany alum whose father, an IFB pastor, frequently hosted Ford’s touring chorus during his training.\n\nRider recalled one new girl she was assigned to supervise: Angela was a firebrand who’d arrived at New Bethany straight out of a mental institution and became such a target of staff and “big sister” discipline that she twice attempted suicide. First she jumped through the glass of a second-story window. Later, she slashed her wrists. Rider found her in the bathroom, surrounded by shards of broken mirror. After a housemother bandaged Angela’s arms, Rider said, she heard the girl being beaten down the hall. When Rider tried to apologize, Angela asked why she hadn’t just let her die.\n\n“After a while, I was so brainwashed I didn’t even want to run….I figured this was God’s plan.”\n\nIn 2000, Rider created a New Bethany “survivor” forum comprising as many as 400 former residents and staff. Among them was Cat Givens, an Ohio radio technician who stayed at New Bethany in 1974 and became so shell-shocked by the routine of punishment and submission—and the spectacle of runaways being returned by the police and handcuffed to their beds—that she lost her will to resist. “After a while, I was so brainwashed I didn’t even want to run,” she told me. “I figured this was God’s plan.”\n\nKaren Glover, a Navy veteran who attended Indiana’s Roloff-inspired Hephzibah House as a girl, described what she calls “the bowel and bladder torture.” The girls were given bran, made to drink lots of water at breakfast, and then denied bathroom access until lunchtime. There was no apparent reason for this treatment, Glover says, save reminding the girls who was in charge. Dave Halyaman, assistant director of Hephzibah House, would not respond directly to Glover’s claims. Instead, he offered to put me in touch with two pastors who had daughters there. “We have our critics, but also people who think very well of us,” he said.\n\nNew Bethany founder Mack Ford proved even less talkative. I reached him at home on three occasions, and he hung up on me twice. He refused to discuss any allegations of abuse. (“I don’t know anything about that,” he said.) Nor would he divulge the name of his attorney or agree to have his attorney contact me.\n\nFord operated a separate New Bethany home for boys in Longstreet, Louisiana. Clark Word, now 44, was sent there when he was about 15. On his second day, he recalls, he watched administrator Larry Rapier punch a boy of 10 or so in the mouth for wetting his pants on the bus to Sunday worship. Violence was the norm, Word says, and students were expected to enforce discipline. In one memorable 1982 incident, a student named Guy disappeared from the school after he was badly beaten with golf clubs by other students, leaving Guy’s terror-stricken friends to wonder whether the staff had finished him off. (Rapier’s ex-wife Dee told me she sent Guy to recover at her mother’s Texas home before returning him to his parents.)\n\nMy attempts to track down Larry Rapier proved fruitless. But Dee Rapier confirmed the atmosphere of physical and psychological torment at the facility she ran with her former husband. “Larry had a room that used to be a storage place that was six by eight, or eight by eight, that he called ‘solitary confinement,'” she told me. (A former staffer called them “revival rooms.”) Misbehaving boys were put in isolation, given a can to pee in, and forced to listen to hours of taped sermons, Word remembers.\n\nAfter Word had been there for almost seven months, his “watch” escaped. Police normally returned runaways to the home, but the severity of the boy’s injuries led state officials to investigate. Rapier, who had continued running the school while free on bond in a 1981 child-abuse case (the charges were eventually dropped), sent the other boys away—some went home, some were placed at kindred facilities. School records, Dee Rapier told me, were shredded.\n\nThe school reopened the next year in Walterboro, South Carolina, under a new administrator, Olin King. Word’s 14-year-old brother, Doug, was sent there soon after for stealing a neighbor’s Playboy magazines. In 1984, police were tipped off by escapees about a rope “chain gang” working the gardens, and beatings with PVC pipe—which, the boys darkly joked, stood for “pound victims cruelly.”\n\nOfficers raiding the compound discovered a young man bound, in his underwear, on the floor of a dark and padlocked isolation cell.\n\nOfficers raided the compound and discovered Doug Word bound, in his underwear, on the floor of a dark and padlocked isolation cell. King and his assistant were charged with kidnapping, unlawful neglect, and conspiracy. They pled no contest to false-imprisonment charges and received suspended sentences and probation. “I took that case personally,” recalls Emory Rush, the now-retired sheriff’s chief deputy who led the raid. “I abhorred the fact that they would do children like they were doing them.”\n\nThe raid grabbed headlines, but the school reopened again, this time merging with Ford’s New Bethany girls’ school in Arcadia. Over the next two decades, both the girls’ and boys’ branches would close and reopen several times more—swelling at times to hundreds of students.\n\nAuthorities and watchdog groups are familiar with the patterns—the state-hopping, the frequent openings and closings—but “people forget,” says Deputy Rush. Indeed, Olin King (who through his wife declined to comment for this article) now runs a North Carolina home for preteen boys under the names King Family Ministries and Second Chance Ranch. New Bethany alumni alerted local authorities to King’s past and his new location. But Maj. Durward Bennett, the former chief deputy of the local sheriff’s department, told me they didn’t see fit to investigate King’s new home because, Bennett erroneously insisted, King was never convicted, and North Carolina has never deemed him unfit to operate a home.\n\nThe operators of shady homes do seem to have a knack for avoiding major prosecution. Just last year, prosecutors in Blount County, Alabama, charged Jack Patterson—a Roloff protégé and founder of a boys’ home called Reclamation Ranch—with aggravated child abuse. Then-prosecutor Tommy Rountree said deputies raided the ranch after an escapee alerted them to beatings, isolation cells, and armed staffers who would “go hunting for runaways.”\n\nThe raid uncovered handguns and rifles, leg irons, and handcuffs; 11 boys were taken into state custody. But because deputies neglected to seize Patterson’s computer, which the escapee claimed contained files of videotaped beatings, Patterson was able to plead his felony charges down to a “verbal harassment” misdemeanor carrying a $500 fine. He now runs a home for adult men on the Reclamation Ranch property and a girls’ home called Rachel Academy in neighboring Walker County—and is in the process, he says, of opening new homes in Ohio, Florida, and Michigan.\n\nReclamation Ranch founder Lee Patterson calls the abuse allegations bogus: The ranch, he insists, had “a family-style atmosphere.”\n\nRountree, who bluntly calls Patterson “evil,” says he and his staff traveled extensively to gather testimony from former Reclamation Ranch kids, but found little usable evidence. He blames this on the contracts parents sign—one mother who owed Patterson money feared that “Big Jack” might sue her if she cooperated with the state—as well as fervent support for men like Patterson among many Christian fundamentalists.\n\nPatterson insists that the abuse allegations were bogus and denies using any corporal punishment or isolation tactics. Reclamation Ranch, he says, had “a family-style atmosphere.” He points to his misdemeanor sentence as proof that the prosecution was politically motivated. As for the shackles and weapons, “I never knew how they got there,” he told me. “My fingerprints were never on them.” But he adds that he fired three staff members shortly before the raid for abusive methods: one for shooting a rifle over the boys’ heads, one for “roughhousing” a resident and shoving him into a locker, and one for placing a boy in handcuffs.\n\nDespite the bad PR, Christian reform facilities appear to have no trouble attracting new recruits. Bruce Gerencser, who spent 25 years as an IFB pastor, recalls Lester Roloff visiting his Bible college to promote the homes. Once Gerencser reached the pulpit, he saw teen-home directors showing up at pastors’ fellowship meetings to peddle their services; Hephzibah House director Ron Williams—who now hosts a show on the Bob Jones University radio station—visited Gerencser’s own church with a girls’ chorus. “I would give literature to parents about the schools,” says Gerencser, who is now a critic of the IFB mindset. “I’d never visited those homes, but you took at face value that people were doing good things. I look back on it and see how irresponsible that was.”\n\nIn September 2008, Clark Word began doing some research on New Bethany. He found Rider’s online community, which included Dee Rapier, the wife of his old nemesis. Now 65 and living in Texarkana, Texas, Dee had pleaded for forgiveness from her former charges. She had posted her phone number for anyone wanting to talk, drawing a cautious but earnest call from Word. “She wanted to know how I’d turned out,” Word recalls. “She said, ‘So many of you turned out to have alcohol and drug problems.’ I didn’t tell her at that point that she’d ruined my life.”\n\nIndeed, a lot of the kids who were forced to regale churchgoers with phony addiction stories turned to drinking and drugs to help them cope with what happened at the schools. After leaving Hephzibah House, Karen Glover ended up becoming both an addict and a sex worker for a time. Teresa Frye “did my body weight in drugs” after her stint at New Bethany. Lenee Rider “stayed drunk for a year.” Angela, her old watch, died of complications from cirrhosis in 2008. “I felt they stole whatever was inside me that allowed me to trust,” Rider says.\n\nNEW BETHANY FINALLY shut down its remaining Louisiana compound after years of police raids and legal battles. Its board of directors reportedly voted for closure in 2001, but rumors abound that New Bethany boarded girls as late as 2004. That the home’s own former staffers aren’t sure of the year speaks volumes about an industry so poorly regulated that state officials can’t verify whether certain homes even exist.\n\nSurvivors and their families complain that the state authorities seem uninterested in prosecuting abuses at the homes—particularly in Missouri, where some facilities settle so far out in the sticks that state agencies are unaware of them. Nanci Gonder, press secretary for the Missouri attorney general’s office, suggests that officials are hamstrung—private schools don’t require state accreditation and are not governed by laws regulating the public schools. “Our only authority is through the Missouri Merchandising Practices Act, which would include concerns like false advertising,” she says.\n\nThat’s the backdoor channel that Donna, a military wife and mother of eight in the Northeast, ended up taking. In 2007, she sent her 14-year-old daughter, Kelsey, to the Circle of Hope Girls Ranch in Humansville, Missouri. The girl had been caught drinking with school friends. Donna, spread thin with her husband on his third Iraq deployment, and fearful of a family history of substance abuse, worried that Kelsey was headed for trouble. At Circle of Hope, Kelsey was allegedly ordered to do pushups in horse manure, restrained and sat upon by staff members, and pushed to make false confessions about promiscuity. Donna estimates that the family spent $20,000 on her three-month stay—tuition and fees, plus the cost of counseling and educational catch-up required after Kelsey came home. Jay Kirksey, Circle of Hope’s attorney, would not address Donna’s claims, but he extended an invitation to come visit. “Unfortunately, just like there is in the public schools and public sector, there are disgruntled parents, who, instead of looking at their own child and situation, choose to talk about the school,” he said.\n\n“We have laws to protect people from illegal incarceration,” says an alum of one tough-love home for teens. “But apparently not if you’re a teenage girl.”\n\nDonna told me that she has approached at least seven state and federal offices—including the Missouri AG—seeking action against Circle of Hope for stating falsely on its website that it was state-registered, a claim she says gave her the confidence to send Kelsey there. “I’ve been fighting this. I’ve been calling everyone,” Donna says, “and I want to know: Why is nothing being done?”\n\n“Our Consumer Protection Division is still looking into the issue,” Gonder responds. “The school cooperated in providing information, but their information was different from hers.”\n\nAt both the state and federal levels, the “troubled teen” industry—religious and secular—enjoys quiet support from many politicians. (Key fundraisers for Mitt Romney’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns hail from Utah’s teen-home sector.) Local courts promote the homes as an alternative to juvenile detention, and facilities can collect a variety of state and federal grants.\n\nCongress has tried, and so far failed, to rein in the schools. In 2007, a spate of deaths at teen residential programs prompted a nationwide investigation by the Government Accountability Office. Its findings—which detailed the use of extended stress positions, days of seclusion, strenuous labor, denial of bathroom access, and deaths—came out in a series of dramatic congressional hearings over two years. The result was House Resolution 911 (PDF), which proposed giving residents access to child-abuse hotlines and creating a national database of programs that would document reports of abuse and keep tabs on abusive staff members.\n\nHephzibah House’s Ron Williams and Reclamation Ranch’s Jack Patterson urged supporters to fight the bill. In an open letter, Williams argued that it would “effectively close all Christian ministries helping troubled youth because of its onerous provisions.” They were joined by a group called the National Association of Therapeutic Schools and Programs, which opposed HR 911 on the grounds that states—despite all evidence to the contrary—are best situated to oversee the homes. The bill passed in the House, but stalled in a Senate committee.*\n\nIn March 2010, the House passed the Keeping All Students Safe Act, a bill that would have banned the use of seclusion and physical or chemical restraints by any school that benefits from federal education money. (It, too, died in the Senate.) Andy Kopsa, who covers abusive homes in her blog, Off the Record, noted that GOP members whose districts host tough-love schools rallied against the act. They included former Indiana Rep. Mark Souder (Hephzibah House), Alabama Rep. Robert Aderholt (Reclamation Ranch, Rachel Academy), and North Carolina Rep. Virginia Foxx (King Family Ministries), who testified: “This bill is not needed…The states and the localities can handle these situations. They will look after the children.”\n\nIn the absence of federal action, alumni of the teen institutions have been trying to expose the abuses. In 2008, Susan Grotte, a Hephzibah House alum, led some 60 survivors in campaigning for its closure; they wrote to newspapers and picketed outside the county courthouse in Warsaw, Indiana, near where the school is located. “We have laws to protect people from illegal incarceration,” she says, “but apparently not if you’re a teenage girl.” In the past year, New Bethany alums staged a reunion trip to confront the Fords, and they joined with members of kindred groups such as Survivors of Institutional Abuse to gather and publicize survivor stories. SIA is planning a 2012 convention for adults who have been through “lockdown teen facilities.”\n\nBack in Maryland, Jeannie Marie has introduced Roxy to the survivor community in the hope that sharing her ordeal will help her recover. “I show her the websites,” Jeannie Marie says, “and tell her, ‘Look how long ago this happened to these girls: 5, 10, 15, 20 years ago. These girls are just letting go and finding freedom because they started discussing this.’ I said, ‘Roxy, don’t wait that long.'”\n\nClarification: The version of this article that appeared in the magazine left the impression that Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) was concerned that HR 911 could interfere with parents’ rights. In fact, in a letter to the constituents inquiring about the bill, Brown had simply noted that this was a concern of the bill’s opponents, not necessarily his own view.",
  "latent_7161": "As Joss Whedon‘s latest TV series – Agents of Shield – is premiering in the UK this evening, it felt like time for fact about the God of the Nerds’ early career.\n\nLong before the Avengers and shortly after writing the film version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Whedon was a writer with Disney. He was seconded to a small studio named Pixar that was producing its first feature film. If they could pull it off it would be a ground breaking project: the first computer-animated feature film. However, Pixar was struggling to turn the concept into a script and had gone through numerous writers already. Whedon recalls his role thus:\n\nthey sent me the script and it was a shambles, but the story that Lasseter had come up with was, you know, the toys are alive and they conflict. The concept was gold. It was just right there. And that’s the dream job for a script doctor: a great structure with a script that doesn’t work. A script that’s pretty good? Where you can’t really figure out what’s wrong, because there’s something structural that’s hard to put your finger on? Death. But a good structure that just needs a new body on it is the best. So I was thrilled. I went up to Pixar…and stayed there for weeks and wrote for, I think, four months before it got greenlit, and completely overhauled the script. There was some very basic things in there that stayed in there. The characters were pretty much in place except for the dinosaur, which was mine. I took out a lot of extraneous stuff, including the neighbor giving the kid a bad haircut before he leaves. There was a whole lot of extraneous stuff.\n\nWhile by dint of his role as script doctor Whedon seems mostly to have been refining what was already there, he did bring in some innovations of his own. Notably, he devised my favourite character: Rex the ‘diffident dinosaur.’\n\nSome of his ideas might have lead to an even bigger changes had they been implemented. According David A. Price’s history of Pixar, Whedon:\n\n…sought a pivotal role for Barbie. As Whedon pictured it, Woody and Buzz, seemingly doomed at Sid’s house, would be rescued by Barbie in a commando style raid. Her character was to be patterned after Linda Hamilton’s portrayal of Sarah Connor in Terminator 2. (The concept of a two-fisted, derriere-kicking heroine, still a novelty at the time, had also featured in Whedon’s script for the 1992 film version of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.) Whedon’s vision came to naught, however, when Mattel refused to license Barbie.\n\nIt is nonetheless striking how little interviews with and profiles of Whedon mention his work on Toy Story. This is in part because much of the rest of his work is so impressive. But Toy Story is a seminal film that had a huge cultural and commercial impact, and it is doubtful that without Whedon it would have worked. It would certainly have lacked much of its sparkling dialogue and of course Rex. It should still merit a mention when his career is discussed. That it doesn’t is I would suggest a product of our attraction to the idea of creative works as the product of a single great mind. Whedon said of his role “I definitely feel I played a part in “Toy Story,” a substantial one, but it is John Lasseter’s movie.” Because we struggle with the idea that films are team efforts, we tend to lionise a single creator for each work. So Lasseter is given sole credit for Toy Story, and indeed all the people other than Whedon who made the Avengers or Buffy a success are overlooked. I can’t be alone in finding that a shame.\n\nNote on sources: The Quotes from Whedon are taken from this interview. Otherwise where I’ve not provided a link the source is David Price’s book.",

So I decided to come up with a candle aesthetic that’s anything but.\n\nHarnessing one of my favorite trends, ombré, and using essential oils for scent, these candles elevate the look of the typical crayon candle—and don’t smell anything like an elementary school.\n\nEven better, I created these candles in an afternoon, using mostly ingredients I have around the house! Here’s how to make some ombré votive candles of your own.\n\nYou will need:\n\nInstructions\n\nPreheat your oven to 275 degrees Fahrenheit/121 degrees Celsius. Some candlemakers will recommend 250 degrees F, but I prefer a hotter pour for a smoother candle finish.\n\n2. Select three crayon colors to use for each layer of your candle. You can choose to go from dark to light or light to dark. The closer together your colors are, the more subtle the ombré effect will be.\n\n3. Scoop 1/4 of a cup of candle wax into each of three paper cups. Top it with broken up crayon pieces. If you are using a block of wax, chop it up finely first. The smaller your pieces, the more even your melted wax will appear.\n\n4. Put your first layer of wax and color into a paper cup, and place it in the muffin tin. At the same time, put a tiny amount of uncolored wax in another paper cup next to it. Put them both in the oven for 5 minutes.\n\n5. After five minutes, add essential oil of your choice to the still-melting first layer, and put it back in the oven for 5 more minutes. Take out the cup with the small amount of uncolored wax. Dip your wick in it, and use it to affix the base of the wick to the bottom of your candle votive.\n\n6. When the first layer of wax is fully melted, stir it with a popsicle stick to make sure the crayon wax has colored it evenly. Add more essential oil until you reach your desired scent intensity (probably a drop or two). Pour the first layer of wax into the candle votive on a level workspace.\n\n7. Wait until the first layer of the candle has dried for 15-20 minutes, and then add the second layer. Repeat for the third.\n\n8. Let candle cool for one to two hours, and you’re done!\n\nHave you made my ombré candle recipe? If so, I would love to hear about it/see your candles! Be sure to leave a comment.",

The other stuff, I didn't get all that excited about us winning 90, I'm not going to get that excited about us beating somebody who's won 82 in a row at home.\"\n\nMosqueda-Lewis scored 19 points as UConn (11-0) thoroughly outplayed Stanford (11-1) on both ends of the floor in this highly touted game featuring the country's top programs and Final Four regulars from opposite coasts.\n\nStanford got harassed right off the home floor that it ruled with perfection and dominant play for nearly six years -- and the Huskies surely took the Cardinal's No. 1 spot along with it.\n\nThe game was the 51st meeting between the top two teams in the poll. The No. 1 seed had won the previous nine matchups and holds a 31-20 lead.\n\nChiney Ogwumike had 18 points and 13 rebounds but struggled in the post as Stanford lost at home for the first time since March 2007.\n\n\"It was a bad day.

Since 1900, some 4,500 cubic kilometers of groundwater around the world—enough to fill Lake Tahoe 30 times—have done just that.\n\n“Long-term groundwater depletion represents a large transfer of water from the continents to the oceans,” retired hydrogeologist Leonard Konikow wrote earlier this year in one article. “Thus, groundwater depletion represents a small but nontrivial contributor to SLR [sea-level rise].”\n\nSea levels have risen 7 to 8 inches since the late 19th century and are expected to rise more rapidly by 2100. The biggest factors are associated with climate change: melting glaciers and other ice and the thermal expansion of warming ocean waters.\n\nGroundwater flowing out to sea added another half-inch—6 to 7 percent of overall sea level rise from 1900 to 2008, Konikow reported in a 2011 article in Geophysical Research Letters. “That really surprised a lot of people,” he said in a recent interview with Reveal.\n\nKonikow also has reported that 1,000 cubic kilometers—twice the volume of Lake Erie—were depleted from aquifers in the US from 1900 to 2008, and the pace of the pumping is increasing.\n\nIn California, so much groundwater has been pumped from aquifers in parts of the San Joaquin Valley that the land itself is starting to sink like a giant pie crust, wreaking havoc with roads, bridges and water delivery canals.\n\nNot only is groundwater growing scarce, but we’re pumping out older and older water. In parts of California, cities and farms are tapping reserves that fell to Earth during a much wetter climatic regime—the ice age, a phenomenon that Reveal covered earlier this month and which raises questions about future supplies as the climate turns drier.\n\nLast week, NASA senior water scientist Jay Famiglietti warned that “the state has only about one year of water supply left in its reservoirs, and our strategic backup supply, groundwater, is rapidly disappearing.”\n\nAccording to Konikow, groundwater overdraft in the US accounted for about 22 percent of global groundwater depletion from 1900 to 2008, contributing about an eighth of an inch to global sea level rise.",

  "latent_7507": "Reverse-seared steaks start in a low oven and end in a hot pan on the stovetop. By searing at the end, you’ll get tender, perfectly cooked meat with a crisp, burnished crust every time.\n\nGet the Recipe Reverse-Seared Steak\n\nMore Guide to Steak All the methods and tips you need to make perfect steak, each and every time.\n\nI've been using and writing about the reverse sear—the technique of slow-cooking a steak or roast before finishing it off with a hot sear—for well over a decade now, but I've never written a definitive guide for using it on steaks. It's a really remarkable method, and if you're looking for a steak that's perfectly medium-rare from edge to edge, with a crisp crust, there's no better technique that I know of.\n\nHere is that definitive article we've been missing, outlining what I think is the best way to cook a steak, indoors or out.\n\nThe full history of the reverse sear is a little hazy (though AmazingRibs.com has a pretty good timeline). It's one of those techniques that seem to have been developed independently by multiple people right around the same time. With all the interest in food science and precision cooking techniques like sous vide that cropped up in the early 2000s, I imagine the time was simply ripe for it to come around.\n\nMy own experience with it started in 2006, when I was just beginning my very first recipe-writing job. I'd recently been hired as a test cook at Cook's Illustrated magazine, and my first project was to come up with a foolproof technique for cooking thick-cut steaks. After testing dozens and dozens of variables, I realized that I already knew the answer: Cook it sous vide. Traditional cooking techniques inevitably form a gray band of overcooked meat around the outer edges of a steak. Sous vide, thanks to the gentle heat it uses, eliminates that gray band, producing a steak that's cooked just right from edge to edge.\n\nUnfortunately, at that time, sous vide devices were much too expensive for home cooks. Instead, I tried to devise a method that would deliver similar results with no special equipment. The reverse sear is what I came up with, and the recipe was published in the May/June 2007 issue of the magazine (though it didn't get the name \"reverse sear\" until some time later).\n\nWhy Should You Reverse Sear Your Steak?\n\nIt's called the reverse sear because it flips tradition on its head. Historically, almost every cookbook and chef have taught that when you're cooking a piece of meat, the first step should be searing. Most often, the explanation is that searing \"locks in juices.\" These days, we know that this statement is definitively false. Searing does not actually lock in juices at all; it merely adds flavor. Flipping the formula so that the searing comes at the end produces better results. But what exactly are those better results?\n\nMore Even Cooking\n\nThe temperature gradient that builds up inside a piece of meat—that is, the difference in temperature as you work your way from the edges toward the center—is directly related to the rate at which energy is transferred to that piece of meat. The higher the temperature you use to cook, the faster energy is transferred, and the less evenly your meat cooks. Conversely, the more gently a steak is cooked, the more evenly it cooks.\n\nBy starting steaks in a low-temperature oven, you wind up with almost no overcooked meat whatsoever. Juicier results are your reward.\n\nBetter Browning\n\nWhen searing a piece of meat, our goal is to create a crisp, darkly browned crust to contrast with the tender, pink meat underneath. To do this, we need to trigger the Maillard reaction, the cascade of chemical reactions that occur when proteins and sugars are exposed to high heat. It helps if you think of your screaming-hot cast iron skillet as a big bucket, and the heat energy it contains as water filling that bucket. When you place a steak in that pan, you are essentially pouring that energy out of the skillet and into the steak.\n\nIn turn, that steak has three smaller buckets that can be filled with energy.\n\nThe first is the temperature change bucket: It takes energy to raise the temperature of the surface of that steak.\n\nbucket: It takes energy to raise the temperature of the surface of that steak. Next is the evaporation bucket : It takes energy to evaporate the surface moisture from the steaks.\n\n: It takes energy to evaporate the surface moisture from the steaks. Third is the Maillard browning bucket: It takes energy to trigger those browning reactions.\n\nThe thing is, all of those buckets need to be filled in order. Water won't really start evaporating until it has been heated to 212°F (100°C). The Maillard reaction doesn't really take place in earnest until you hit temperatures of around 300°F (150°C) or higher, and that won't happen until most of the steak's surface moisture has evaporated.\n\nYour goal when searing a steak is to make sure that the temperature and evaporation buckets are as small as possible, so that you can rapidly fill them up and move on to the important process of browning.\n\nPop quiz: Let's say you pull a steak straight out of the fridge. Which of those three buckets is the biggest one? You might think, Well, it's gotta be the temperature bucket—we're starting with a steak that's almost freezing-cold and bringing it up to boiling temperatures.\n\nIn fact, it's the evaporation bucket that is by far the biggest. It takes approximately five times more energy to evaporate a gram of water than it does to raise the temperature of that same gram of water from freezing to boiling. That's a big bucket!\n\nMoral of the story: Moisture is the biggest enemy of a good sear, so any process that can reduce the amount of surface moisture on a steak is going to improve how well it browns and crisps—and, by extension, minimize the amount of time it spends in the pan, thus minimizing the amount of overcooked meat underneath. It's a strange irony that to get the moistest possible results, you should start with the driest possible steak.\n\nThe reverse sear is aces at removing surface moisture. As the steak slowly comes up to temperature in the oven, its surface dries out, forming a thin, dry pellicle that browns extremely rapidly. Want to get your steak to brown even better? Set it on a rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and leave it in the fridge, uncovered, overnight. The cool circulating air of the refrigerator will get it nice and dry. The next day, when you're ready to cook, just pop that whole rack and baking sheet in the oven.\n\nMore Tender Meat\n\nThis one is not quite as obvious, but it can still make a detectable difference: enzymatic tenderization. Meat naturally contains enzymes called cathepsins, which will break down tough muscle protein. Their activity is responsible for the tenderness of dry-aged meat (see our complete guide to dry-aging here).\n\nAt fridge temperatures, cathespins operate very, very slowly—dry-aged meat is typically aged for at least four weeks—but, as the meat heats up, their activity increases more and more rapidly, until it drops off sharply at around 122°F (50°C). By slowly heating your steak, you are, in effect, rapidly \"aging\" it, so that it comes out more tender. Steaks cooked via traditional means pass quickly through that window, reaching the 122°F cutoff point too rapidly for this activity to have any real effect.\n\nMore Flexibility\n\nWhen you're cooking steak at a high temperature, you have a very narrow window of time in which the center of that steak is a perfect medium-rare. A minute too short, and your steak is raw; a minute too long, and it's overcooked. With slow cooking, that window of time is greatly expanded, making it much easier to nail the right temperature time after time. Meathead Goldwyn, author of Meathead: The Science of Great Barbecue, likens it to shooting an arrow at a tortoise versus shooting at a rabbit: The slower it moves, the easier it is to hit.\n\nHow to Reverse Sear a Steak\n\nThe process of reverse-searing is really simple: Season a roast or a thick-cut steak (the method works best with steaks at least one and a half to two inches thick), arrange the meat on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet, and place it in a low oven—between 200 and 275°F (93 and 135°C). You can also do this outdoors by placing the meat directly on the cooler side of a closed grill with half the burners on. Cook it until it's about 10 to 15°F below your desired serving temperature (see the chart at the end of this section), then take it out and sear it in a ripping-hot skillet, or on a grill that's as hot as you can get it.\n\nThen dig into the best-cooked steak you've ever had in your life.\n\nYou want it broken down step by step? Okay, here goes:\n\n1. Season the Steak\n\nSeason your thick-cut steaks—I like ribeyes, but this will work with any thick steak—generously with salt and pepper on all sides, then place them on a wire rack set in a rimmed baking sheet. If you're cooking the steaks on a grill, skip the rack and pan.\n\nFor even better results, refrigerate the steaks uncovered overnight to dry out their exteriors.\n\n2. Preheat the Oven\n\nPreheat the oven to anywhere between 200 and 275°F (93 and 135°C). The lower you go, the more evenly the meat will cook, though it'll also take longer. If you have a very good oven, you can probably set it even lower than this range, but many ovens can't hold temperatures below 200°F very accurately.\n\nIf you're doing this outdoors, create a two-zone fire by banking a chimney of coals under one side of the grill, or turning on only half the burners of a gas grill. Cover the grill and let it preheat.\n\n3. Slow-Cook the Steak\n\nPlace the steaks—baking sheet, rack, and all—in the oven, and roast until they hit a temperature about 10 to 15°F below the final temperature at which you'd like to serve the meat. A good thermometer is absolutely essential for this process. I recommend either the Thermapen or one of these inexpensive options.\n\nIf using the grill, just place the steaks directly on the cooler side of the grill, allowing them to gently cook via indirect heat. Timing may vary depending on the exact temperature that your grill is maintaining, so use a thermometer, and check frequently!\n\n4. Sear the Steak\n\nJust before the steaks come out of the oven, add a tablespoon of vegetable oil or other high-temp-friendly oil to a heavy skillet, then set it to preheat over your strongest burner. Cast iron works great, as does triple-clad stainless steel.\n\nAs soon as that oil starts smoking, add the steaks along with a tablespoon of butter, and let them cook, swirling and lifting occasionally, until they're nicely browned on the first side. This should take about 45 seconds. Flip the steaks and get the second side, then hold the steaks sideways to sear their edges.\n\nTo finish on the grill, remove the steaks and tent them with foil while you build the biggest fire you can, either with all your gas burners at full blast and the lid down to preheat, or with extra coals. When the fire is rip-roaring hot, cook the steaks over the hot side, flipping every few seconds, until they're crisp and charred all over, about a minute and a half total.\n\n5. Serve\n\nServe the steaks immediately, or, if you'd like, let them rest for at most a minute or two. With reverse-seared steaks, there's no need to rest your meat, as you would with a more traditional cooking method.\n\nTemperature and Timing for Reverse-Seared Steak For 1 1/2–Inch Steaks in a 250°F (120°C) Oven Doneness Target Temperature in the Oven Final Target Temperature Approximate Time in Oven Rare 105°F (40°C) 120°F (49°C) 20 to 25 minutes Medium-Rare 115°F (46°C) 130°F (54°C) 25 to 30 minutes Medium 125°F (52°C) 140°F (60°C) 30 to 35 minutes Medium-Well 135°F (57°C) 150°F (66°C) 35 to 40 minutes\n\nNB: All time ranges are approximate. Use a thermometer!\n\nDisadvantages of Reverse-Searing Steak\n\nI'll admit it: Reverse-searing is not all rosy-pink centers. There are three key disadvantages to the process.\n\nThe first is time. It's much faster to simply season a steak and throw it in a hot pan, flipping it every so often until it's cooked.\n\nThe second disadvantage is that steaks cooked via the reverse sear produce almost no fond, the browned bits that get stuck to the pan and form the base for pan sauces. So, if you want a sauce with your reverse-seared steak, you'll have to construct it separately.\n\nThis second disadvantage is, of course, not really much of a disadvantage. The fact that there's no fond in the pan means that all that stuff is stuck firmly in your meat already. You'll probably find that a reverse-seared steak needs no sauce at all.\n\nFinally, the method doesn't work very well for steaks thinner than an inch and a half or so, since they end up cooking through too quickly. If a two-inch-thick steak sounds too big for you, I'd suggest serving a single large steak for every two eaters.\n\nIs Sous-Vide Steak Better Than Reverse-Seared Steak?\n\nIt's true that the reverse sear was initially intended to mimic the effects of sous vide cooking, but as it turns out, the method is actually superior in one important way: searing. Sous vide steaks come out of their bags wet, which makes it very difficult to get a good sear on them, even if you carefully pat them dry. A steak cooked via the reverse sear will come out with a better crust, and thus a deeper, roastier flavor. That said, sous vide is even more foolproof than reverse-searing. It's virtually impossible to overcook a steak when cooking it sous vide, so if consistency is your goal, sous vide should be your cooking method of choice. (You can check out my complete guide to sous vide steaks here.)\n\nOnce you let go of reverse-seared notions about cooking steak, I guarantee that you won't want to use anything but the traditional method to cook your meat in the future.\n\nWait—strike that. Reverse it.\n\nGet the Recipe Reverse-Seared Steak View Recipe »\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners; your purchases via these links can benefit Serious Eats.

  "latent_7559": "A man who entered a ghost pepper-eating contest landed himself in the hospital with a 1-inch hole in his esophagus – a condition that can be fatal – according to a new report.\n\nThe ghost pepper, also known as “bhut jolokia” in its native India, is one of the world’s hottest chili peppers, with a score of more than 1,000,000 on the Scoville scale – a measurement of pungency of chili peppers. For comparison, that’s more than twice as hot as a habanero.\n\nThe case report, by doctors at the University of California-San Francisco and Alameda County Medical Center/Highland Hospital in Oakland, is published in The Journal of Emergency Medicine. It describes a 47-year-old man who came to the emergency room with severe abdominal and chest pain followed by “violent retching and vomiting after eating ghost peppers as part of a contest.”\n\nA chest X-ray showed he had an abnormal amount of fluid in his lung. The doctors intubated him and took him to the operating room for emergency surgery, where they found a 1-inch tear in his esophagus. They diagnosed him with Boerhaave syndrome, or spontaneous esophageal rupture, which the authors describe as a “rare condition encountered by emergency physicians, with a high mortality rate.”\n\nThe man stayed in the hospital for a total of 23 days.\n\n“This case serves as an important reminder of a potentially life-threatening surgical emergency initially interpreted as discomfort after a large spicy meal,” the authors conclude.",
  "latent_7564": "Why So Serious? The VP9 Reliability Test\n\nfirst published on January 14, 2016 by Tim\n\n4.5k SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nI recently posted a video showing a torture test of a H&K VP9 pistol. Given the results of the test, the video sparked quite a bit of discussion around the internet. Some comments were rational and, of course, some not so much. H&K is one of those brands that has a hard earned reputation for uncompromising reliability, as a matter of fact they even used “NO COMPROMISE” as a marketing slogan for years. I, like many, came to believe H&K’s high prices reflected considerable R&D time, top tier engineering and copious amounts of rigorous testing before their products ever saw the light of day.\n\nWhen the VP9 came to market it seemed as though the clouds parted and the gun gods stepped forth with a gift to us mere mortals — a H&K pistol with a street price of $600 or even less. It seemed impossible. The P30, from which the VP9 borrowed heavily in design queues, cost about $200 more. I wasn’t sure how this was possible, but why look a gift horse in the mouth? I couldn’t get my wallet out fast enough to buy my first VP9.\n\nI walked from the cash register to the indoor firing range moments after the purchase and was further dumbfounded by what I witnessed. The VP9 was a gun made for my Yeti hands. The first 5 round group I fired on July 3rd, 2014 started a love affair that lasted until the video above was filmed. Here’s a picture of the very first group fired with the VP9 that fateful day:\n\nAfter firing a lot of ball ammo and 50 rounds of my then favorite carry ammo, 147gr Gold Dots, I suddenly announced to my viewers the VP9 was my new daily carry and was undergoing continued testing as the official replacement for my Glock 19.\n\nI carried and shot the VP9 extensively over the course of a year while my viewers continuously asked me for a full review video. I waited until I had finished my assessment of the gun before I publicly decreed the VP9 as my pick for defensive carry forever going forward. It took me so long because I wanted to be damn sure it was better than the Glock 19 it replaced. I had well over a decade of time spent with the G19 and I didn’t want to rush to any conclusions. The torture video was to be the last evaluation of the VP9 before that declaration was made.\n\nKeep in mind I had invested heavily into the VP9 including two HTC rigs for the gun ($500 a pop) and several other holsters for both inside the waistband and outside the waistband carry. I snagged up a couple hundred dollars in extra magazines and invested $1500 or more in ammo testing it. When I say I was heavily invested in the VP9, I’m not kidding. It was no small thing for me to ditch it.\n\nSo, why did I dump the VP9? What specifically was it that I couldn’t forgive about its performance? The comments I read on my torture test video were interesting to say the least. I saw people making excuses for it not being able to withstand a simple submersion in creek water to claiming I had purposely rigged the test so the gun would fail.\n\nHere’s what happened. I dunked the pistol in water for the very first test that afternoon. There was very little mud in the water, only a fine silt was present. Upon dunking it, my first attempt at firing the gun failed to ignite the chambered round. I was flabbergasted. Before filming the next scene we took the pistol back to the Jeep and broke it down to see what happened. Was it a fluke? Did that one magical speck of grit find its way into that most improbable place which caused the gun to fail to fire? I wanted to know.\n\nSo I broke the gun down and inspected it very closely. I wiped away the water and found almost nothing inside the gun except carbon and water. Any grit I found, which was almost non-existent, was so fine I couldn’t feel it on my finger tips. I could not, for the life of me, find what caused the gun to seize up like that. So, I dried it off with a rag, applied a bit of Breakfree CLP and proceeded to repeat the test. This time I didn’t step on the gun, I simply submerged it, shook it off quickly and attempted to fire. Once again the gun failed to fire. This time was different though, now the trigger wasn’t working properly. I pulled the trigger and nothing happened — no click and certainly no bang. Now I was really puzzled. Once again I broke the gun down and inspected it. I sloshed it around in water and tried to return it to working service. It never made it back to 100% service, the gun had multiple failures no matter what we did for the rest of the afternoon.\n\nNext came the mud test, which at this point I knew would cause it to fail miserably — and it did. At this point the gun became utterly unreliable and nothing I could do in the field would return it to 100% service. Once grit/mud made it inside the gun, it was done. Most every other gun I’ve tested over the years could be returned to service with a quick dunking in creek or river water as I demonstrated with my Century Arms TP9 video.\n\nAt this point I knew the VP9 was not for me. I was done with the gun that afternoon and nothing would ever rebuild my faith in it. I came to the conclusion the gun was a fine range gun but not well suited for the task of defending one’s life. Others may disagree, and many certainly do, however I place a fairly high standard on the tools I consider for self defense. I don’t accept failure in my carry gun when other pistols are more reliable. Unlike far too many gun owners, I do not emotionally invest in tools. If a tool fails me or my trust is shaken, I find another tool as there are plenty to choose from.\n\nHere are the primary issues I discovered about the VP9 that, if remedied, might render it a self defense worthy fighting pistol in my view.\n\nThe gun’s recoil spring is horribly under sprung. The tiniest amount of fouling will cause the gun to not fully go into battery when running the slide, or if you push the nose of the slide rearward. This is why the gun does not work well with suppressors. The recoil spring runs out of energy at the end of its travel and can’t close the slide on a fresh round with a suppressor attached where other pistols like the Glock, M&P, XD, 1911, etc. can do so quite easily.\n\nThe trigger bar that runs along the inside of the magazine well is poorly designed. The tiniest particulate matter that finds its way in there, be it silt from water or perhaps even pocket lint, can cause the trigger not to engage the sear and the gun not to fire (you can see this happening in my VP9 test video where multiple pulls of the trigger don’t fire the weapon).\n\nThe magazine release leaver is weak and poorly placed. I can easily snap them off with thumb pressure.\n\nThe gun could benefit from having striker cups similar to those offered for the Glock which allow water to rapidly escape the striker channel should the gun be submerged.\n\nI have come to believe the VP9’s low price is the result of cost savings realized through reduced R&D time, testing time and quality assurance. Let’s face it, there’s no free lunch when it comes to manufacturing. If the VP9 is $200 less than the P30 there’s a reason and that reason is likely cost savings somewhere in the design and manufacturing of the gun. The target audience was the consumer that makes their primary purchasing decision on price. The VP9 hit that market square on the nose at the expense of alienating the military/LEO/self defense market that have come to expect more from HK products.",
  "latent_7578": "If you had to guess what part of the the U.S. has the very worst air pollution–where winds and topography conspire with fumes from gasoline-chugging vehicles to create an aerial cesspool–places like Los Angeles, Atlanta and as of late, Salt Lake City, would probably pop to mind. The reality may come as a bit of a surprise. According to the Environmental Protection agency, California’s bucolic San Joaquin Valley is “home of the worst air quality in the country.”\n\nNot coincidentally, the San Joaquin Valley is also the most productive agricultural region in the world and the top dairy-producing region in the country. Heavy duty-diesel trucks constantly buzz through the valley, emitting 14 tons of the greenhouse gas ozone daily, and animal feed spews a whopping 25 tons of ozone per day as it ferments, according to a 2010 study. In addition, hot summertime temperatures encourage ground-level ozone to form, according to the San Joaquin Valley Air Pollution Control District. Pollution also streams down from the Bay Area, and the Sierra Nevada Mountains to the east help to trap all of these pollutants near the valley floor. Particulate matter that creates the thick greyish-brown smog hanging over the valley is of paramount concern–it’s been linked to heart disease, childhood asthma and other respiratory conditions.\n\nSo when NASA devised a new, five-year air quality study to help fine-tune efforts to accurately measure pollution and greenhouse gases from space, it targeted the San Joaquin Valley. “When you’re trying to understand a problem, you go where the problem is most obvious,” the study’s principal investigator, Jim Crawford, said in an interview. To Crawford, the dirty air over the valley may be important to evaluating how human activities contribute to climate change. “Climate change and air quality are really traced back to the same root in the sense that air quality is the short term effect of human impact and climate change the long term effect,” Crawford said.\n\nIn January and February, NASA sent two research planes into the skies above San Joaquin Valley to collect data on air pollution. One plane flew at high altitude over the valley during the daytime, armed with remote sensors, while the second plane cruised up and down the valley, periodically spiraling down toward the ground to compare the pollution at higher and lower altitudes. Weather balloons were used for ground-level measurements as well.\n\nThe data NASA collected in the experiment was similar to what satellites can see from space: the presence of ozone, fine particulates, nitrogen dioxide and formaldehyde (precursors to pollution and ozone) and carbon monoxide (which has a median lifetime of a month and can be used to watch the transport of pollution). But satellites are limited in their air-quality-sensing abilities. “The real problem with satellites is that they’re currently not quantitative enough,” Crawford told Surprising Science. “They can show in a coarse sense where things are coming from, but they can’t tell you how much there is.”\n\nNor can satellites distinguish between pollution at the ground level and what exists higher in the atmosphere. Also, they circle just once a day, and if it isn’t in the early morning, when commuters are busily burning fossil fuels, or in the late afternoon, when emissions have festered and air quality is at its worst, scientists don’t have a clear picture of just how bad pollution can get. Monitoring stations on the ground are likewise limited. They provide scientists with a narrow picture that doesn’t include the air farther above the monitoring station or an understanding of how the air mixes and moves. The research from the NASA study, specifically that collected by the spiraling airplane, fills in these gaps.\n\nData from the flights will also be used in conjunction with future satellites. “What we’re trying to move toward is a geostationary satellite that will stare at America throughout the day,” Crawford told Surprising Science. Geostationary satellites–which will be able to measure overall levels of pollution–can hover over one position, but like current satellites, researchers need ancillary data from aircraft detailing how pollution travels above the Earth’s surface, like that retrieved from the San Joaquin Valley, to help validate and interpret what satellites see. “The satellite is never going to operate in isolation and the ground station isn’t going to do enough,” Crawford said.\n\nBut first, the research will be plugged into air-quality computer models, which will help locate the sources of emissions. Knowing how sources work together to contribute to poor air quality, where pollution is and exactly what levels it’s hitting is a priority for the EPA, which sets air-quality regulations, and the state agencies that enforce them, according to Crawford. The data will inform their strategies on reducing emissions and cleaning the air with minimal impact to the economy and other quality-of-life issues. “Air quality forecasts are great,” Crawford says. “But at some point people will ask, ‘Why aren’t we doing something about it?’ The answer is that we are.” The researchers have conducted similar flights over the Washington, D.C. area and are planning flyovers of Houston and possibly Denver in the years to come.\n\nOne thing’s for sure: Data to inform action is sorely needed. In 2011, Sequoia and Kings Canyon National Park, on the eastern edge of the valley, violated the EPA’s national ambient air quality standard a total of 87 days of the year and Fresno exceeded the standard 52 days. Pinpointing exactly where pollution originates and who’s responsible–a goal of the study–will go a long way to clearing the air, so to speak.",

  "latent_7930": "Still, owing to its legacy of Soviet bases to support any ground war to the west, the military is poorly positioned to counter an attack from the east, according to Ruslan Pukhov, the director of the Center for Analysis of Strategies and Technologies, a military research institution in Moscow. The thin military presence in the east complicates any response if Russia chooses, for instance, to back pro-Russian activists who have reportedly seized administrative buildings in Kharkiv, in eastern Ukraine.\n\nAccording to its website, the Ukrainian military has a total of 130,000 people under arms, with reserves of some one million. While conscription recently ended, it remains a largely conscript army. Ukraine has partially reformed its military since the Soviet days, when it was organized in large-scale divisions. It is now organized on the more flexible brigade system and has been reducing the size of its military forces, but it is underfunded with a lot of outdated hardware.\n\nUkraine had accomplished some military reform with NATO advice, but since President Yanukovych said that Ukraine was not interested in full NATO membership, cooperation has lagged, the NATO official said. Ukraine has, however, taken part in some military exercises with NATO, contribute some troops to NATO’s response force and helped in a small way in Libya.\n\nIn general, the Ukrainians are considered to have excellent home-produced tanks, but have also relied in part on the BMP-1, an infantry fighting vehicle that is a combined armored personnel carrier and light tank dating from the early 1970s. Ukrainian air defenses, all produced in Russia and a generation behind, are considered weak.\n\nMr. Pukhov, at the military research institution in Moscow, said that the Ukrainian military inherited a vast supply of legacy weapons from three Soviet military districts. “But 22 years have gone by during a state of near continuous economic decline and the Ukrainian military has received practically no new equipment,” he said. “Now the force is somewhat pathetic.”\n\nHe said the forces in Crimea were there less to defend Crimea than to prevent Crimean Tatar separatism and even more unofficially, Russian separatism. During Ukraine’s recent military reforms, contract soldiers were allowed to serve near their homes, meaning that many of the junior officer corps on the peninsula are also residents of Crimea, which is majority ethnic-Russian, so they are possibly more pro-Russian in their views.\n\nOn Saturday, Pyotr N.

  "latent_8180": "The labor movement has more than its share of critics. It seems like nearly everyone is ready to give it advice, whether solicited or not.\n\nA case in point: Francis Fox Piven, the renowned sociologist known for her seminal work on social movements, gave a talk to a group of graduate students at the University of Chicago recently. Her subject: “Can Labor Recover?”\n\nAccording to a (seemingly sympathetic) blog by David Moberg in In These Times, Piven argued that the transformation of the labor movement lies in building a “mass strike movement” in which trade unionists think beyond the narrow calculations of monetary gains and losses.\n\n“Maybe the mass strike movement will well up outside the labor movement and incorporate it” she said, “I hope so, because I think that the future of the labor movement depends on it.”\n\nThe Occupy movement, Piven went on to say, should work with labor but “on its own terms, not labor’s terms.”\n\nThe labor movement “is not a movement, but a constellation of competing interests groups.”\n\nThen she added, “Labor is one of my favorites; it can rebuild, but not with the same leaders and structures. Without pressure from below and outside, I don’t think unions can save themselves.”\n\nWow! Listening to Piven, one gets the impression that labor and its leadership, other than telling the Occupy movement what to do, are sitting on their hands – self satisfied, clueless, and in need of a takeover from the outside.\n\nAt its core this estimate of labor not only amounts to a misrepresentation of what labor is doing, but also expresses a patronizing attitude toward the organization that represents working women and men.\n\nPiven, at least from the Moberg blog, presents no evidence for her sweeping claims. Nor does she indicate who is going to change labor from the outside. One can only guess.\n\nFrom my observations and experience, many labor leaders and members are responding to new challenges, reaching out to allies, creating new forms of organization, solidarity, and unity, and not least, diversifying their leadership.\n\nConsider the following:\n\nWithout diminishing the importance of the Occupy movement last fall – a movement that changed the political discourse in the country – what labor did in Wisconsin and Ohio was nothing to sneeze at. Indeed, it was of tremendous significance.\n\nHundreds of thousands were mobilized in a sustained, creative, and tactically varied way to fight the initiatives of the Republican right at the state level. And in both states, the struggle goes on.\n\nThe AFL-CIO, moreover, has embraced and incorporated workers centers and other non-traditional forms of organization that are linked to mostly very low paid super exploited workers – immigrant workers, day laborers, taxi cab drivers in New York, and carwash workers in Los Angeles, to name a few.\n\nUnions have extended their ties with other unions and workers around the world to take on the global corporations, and labor has continued to grow its own structures for political independence, including workers running for office.\n\nTrade unions have embraced the Occupy movement. It didn’t tell Occupy what to do; in fact, the AFL-CIO sent out a letter to all its affiliates counseling the opposite.\n\nLabor has plans to activate 400,000 trade unionists and friends to do door-to-door work to educate and get out the vote in the fall elections. Of course, some on the left may think that this form of struggle pales in importance to a mass strike.\n\nFirst of all, it is wrong to counterpose a mass strike against a full-scale mobilization of labor and its allies in the electoral arena.\n\nIn fact, I would go a step further and say from a strategic point of view that nothing is more important than winning a decisive victory against the right at the polls this November.\n\nAnd the left and progressive movements should wholeheartedly support whatever helps to achieve this objective. After all, such a victory carries the potential to fundamentally alter the terrain of struggle on which the labor and people’s movements fight.\n\nSecond, a mass strike can neither be hot housed, nor it is a cure all. Sure it would shift the ground on which labor fights, but its full impact grows to the degree that it spotlights the main class enemy and combines with other forms of struggle to effect a realignment of politics in a consistently anti-corporate direction.\n\nPiven’s take on the labor movement is not peculiar to her alone, but rather is emblematic of a section of the left, academic and otherwise. Which I guess is not surprising, given the distance between the world of the university and the world of working people.\n\nIn any case, the left, including the academic left, should be knowledgeable about the labor movement. It should hail and join its initiatives.\n\nThis doesn’t preclude criticism, but it should be done in a constructive, unifying, and partisan way. It should be always mindful not only of the very difficult circumstances in which labor fights, but also the necessary role that it will play in any progressive and socialist thrust in U.S. politics.\n\nPhoto: At the rally where thousands of Ohioans joined together to make history by turning in 1,298,000 signatures to repeal SB 5.

When the US military was looking for a new high-speed small-caliber round to replace the .308 Winchester (7.62x51), Remington started with the .222 Remington, and stretched it to increase powder capacity by about 20% in 1958 to make the .222 Remington Magnum. The cartridge was not accepted by the military, but it was introduced commercially. In 1964, the 5.56x45 mm, also based on a stretched .222 Rem case (and very similar to the .222 Rem Magnum), was adopted along with the new M-16 rifle. As with the .222 Rem Magnum, the new military case achieved enhanced velocity (over the .222 Rem) by increasing case capacity with a longer body section and shorter neck. This military modification of the .222 Rem was originally called the .222 Special but was later renamed the .223 Remington. In military metric nomenclature, the round is called the 5.56x45. For the full history of the 5.56x45 cartridge, read the 5.56x45 Timeline, by Daniel Watters.\n\n.223 Remington vs. 5.56x45--Chambering and Throat Considerations\n\nIs the .223 Remington the same as the 5.56x45? The answer is yes and no. There ARE differences between the .223 Remington as shot in civilian rifles and the 5.56x45 in military use. While the external cartridge dimensions are essentially the same, the .223 Remington is built to SAAMI specs, rated to 50,000 CUP max pressure, and normally has a shorter throat. The 5.56x45 is built to NATO specs, rated to 60,000 CUP max pressure, and has a longer throat, optimized to shoot long bullets. That said, there are various .223 Remington match chambers, including the Wylde chamber, that feature longer throats. Military 5.56x45 brass often, but not always, has thicker internal construction, and slightly less capacity than commercial .223 Rem brass.\n\nShould you be worried about shooting 5.56x45 milspec ammo in a .223 Remington? The answer really depends on your chamber. 5.56 x45 ammo is intended for chambers with longer throats. If you shoot hot 5.56x45 ammo in short-throated SAAMI-spec chambers you can encounter pressure issues. The new long-throated 'Wylde' chamber allows safe use of military ammo. Wylde chambers are quite common in Rock River guns. Other manufacturers, such as Fulton Armory, offer modified \"match chambers\" with extended throats that allow safe use of 5.56x45 ammo in .223 Remington rifles. For a complete discussion of the .223 Rem vs. 5.56x45 question, read this Tech Notice from Winchester, and this GunZone Commentary by Dean Speir. Without belaboring the point, we'll repeat the official SAAMI position: \"Chambers for military rifles have a different throat configuration than chambers for sporting firearms which, together with the full metal jacket of the military projectile, may account for the higher pressures which result when military ammunition is fired in a sporting chamber. SAAMI recommends that a firearm be fired only with the cartridge for which it is specifically chambered by the manufacturer.\"\n\nTwist Rates\n\nThe .223 Rem shoots a wide range of bullets very effectively, from 35gr flat-based varmint bullets, to ultra-long 90gr VLDs. However, you'll need the right twist rate for your choice of bullet. For max velocity and accuracy with the lightest bullets, a 1:14\" twist may be ideal. More versatile is a 1:12\" twist that will allow you to shoot the popular 60-64 grain match bullets. (However, a 1:9\" twist is needed for the steel-core 62gr bullet used in the M855 military loads, because that bullet is as long as most 70-grainers.) For normal lead-core jacketed bullets, a 1:9\" twist will let you shoot up to 73gr bullets. Since most .223 Rem shooters prefer bullets in the 50-73gr range, a good \"do-it-all\" solution is a 9-twist, unless you're a Highpower competitor.\n\nFor long-range match purposes, long, high-BC bullets are favored for their ability to buck the wind. You'll want at least a 1:8\" twist to shoot the 77gr and 80gr MatchKings and 80gr Bergers. To shoot the new 90gr pills, a 1:6.5\" is recommended, though a true 1:7\" will work in most conditions.\n\nOverall, what twist rate is best? For varminting we like a 12-twist. The slower twist will give you a bit more velocity, and minimize the risk of jacket failure at high rpms. For general use, an 8-twist barrel will let you shoot the excellent 77gr and 80gr Sierra MatchKings and nearly all varieties of non-tracer milsurp ammo. We'd only select a 1:7\" or faster twist barrel if we had a need to shoot the 90gr VLDs.\n\nBarrel Twist Rate 1:14\" 1:12\" 1:9\" 1:8\" 1:7\" or 1:6.5\" Max Bullet Weight 55gr FB 65gr FB 73gr BT 80gr BT 90gr BT VLD\n\nAcknowledgements: Big thanks to Andy (\"Graymist\") for his load data and many hours spent measuring brass,\n\nto Jason for providing some cool photos, and to Sierra Bullets, for making its .223 Rem load data available.\n\nBerger, Sierra, and Hornady also provided bullet samples.\n\nLoading for the .223 Remington Cartridge\n\nGeneral Reloading Advice\n\nThere are no special tricks to reloading the .223 Remington cartridge. Use the same methods and tools you would use for other centerfire cartridges. With anything other than Lapua brass, we recommend you debur the flash hole. Sort by weight if you are loading for competition. Trim the brass to a uniform length and chamfer the case mouth inside and out. We like to use a 28-degree chamfering tool from Sinclair Int'l or Hollands for the inside chamfering, and a 45-degree Forster tool for the outside chamfering. Powder, primer, and bullet selection is discussed in separate sections below. For dies, Forster, Hornady, and Redding sizers and seaters are all good. For shooters who prefer neck-sizing, the Lee Collet Die produces very straight ammo with low run-out. To learn more about advanced case prep techniques, read Preparing Cases for Long-Range Accuracy by Jacob Gottfredson.\n\nReloading for AR15s and other .223 Rem Gas Guns\n\nWith their multiple bolt lugs and rapid locking/unlocking, AR15s are more sensitive to pressure and bolt thrust issues than stout, modern custom bolt actions. There is also a risk of slam-fires in AR15s. Therefore, some high-end loads that may work in a BAT, Barnard, Borden or Stiller bolt action will be too hot for an AR15. This is why Sierra issues a completely separate load map for AR15s chambered in .223 Rem and 5.56x45 (see notes above on 5.56x45 throat length concerns). We recommend the you initially reduce loads at least 0.7 grains for an AR15 compared to a bolt action, and never exceed the powder manufacturers' recommended loads. Click on the button at right to download Sierra's latest .223 Rem loads for the AR15.\n\nWith bolt-action rifles, if you shoot a moderate load, just neck-sizing the brass is a viable alternative for a few loading cycles, though eventually you'll have to run the cases through a body die or full-length sizing die. However, with an AR15, we strongly recommend you full-length size your cases every time. With proper dies, this does not over-stress the brass or lessen the useful life. For full-length sizing where you need control over neck tension, we recommend the Redding Type 'S' full-length bushing die. If you reload the same brand of brass all the time, another solution is to use a Forster full-length die with the neck honed to give your desired neck tension. Forster will hone its dies to your specification for about $12.00 plus shipping.\n\nHigh-Volume Reloading for Varminters\n\nby Graymist Although I enjoy reloading, I would rather spend time hunting. The .223 Rem can benefit from all the case prep tricks, but good accurate .223 Rem varmint ammo has few secrets. Inexpensive hunting ammo can be assembled from once-fired military brass, your choice of 40-55 grain bullets, and most small rifle primers. Important if you are going to use military brass is to remove the primer crimp. I have used both reamers and swagers. I prefer the Dillon primer pocket swager for ease of use. For the prairie dog hunter using military brass you can swage 300+ cases an hour with the Dillon tool. [Editor's NOTE: If you use new IMG (Guatemalan) milsurp brass, $89/1000 from Wideners, no crimp removal is required.] Aside from the primer pocket swaging, full-length sizing is another step I do. Here a Dillon or Wilson case gauge will help determine how much sizing the die needs to do. The next step in case preparation is checking your brass length. In both the .223 Rem and .223 AI, the maximum case length is 1.760\". I use a Lyman Power trimmer to trim them back to 1.750\". Any trimmer will do the job. Last step is to chamfer the inside and outside of the case neck. Then it's time for primer, powder, and bullet. I have two sets of dies and am hard pressed to say which makes the best ammo. Both the Lee and Forster give low run-out and make accurate ammo. Overall length in the .223 Rem varies greatly due to difference in throat length. I measure with a Sinclair OAL tool and then load to .015-.030\" off the lands for my bolt guns. However, my AR15 barrels all have long throats so I simply load all 40-60 grain bullets to fit the magazines in my AR15s. For a recent prairie dog hunt I resorted to a Dillon 550 manual-indexing progressive press to speed up the chores. I resized and loaded in two separate operations as I had swaging and trimming to do between those operations. With the sizing, swaging and trimming done I could then load 300 rounds an hour. Dillon's powder measure is very consistent with Benchmark, H335, AA2230 and TAC. Want a real shortcut? Try once-fired military brass from Scharch Manufacturing. Scharch does all the cleaning, reaming, sizing and trimming. Primed brass is also available. Three years ago I bought processed brass from Scharch and it has worked well.\n\n.223 Remington Components--Brass, Powder, Primers\n\nBrass--New and Once-Fired\n\nTo achieve high levels of accuracy in the .223 Rem, you need quality brass. Among the dozens of .223 Rem/5.56x45 brass makers, Lapua produces the highest quality and most uniform brass we have found. If you look at the charts, new lots of Lapua .223 brass showed the smallest extreme spread in weight among all brands, even though we measured 100 Lapua cases as opposed to 50 with other brands. Lapua is more expensive, but you can reload Lapua cases a dozen times or more. Also, Lapua maintains primer pocket tightness with hot loads better than other brands. After Lapua, the recent Lake City brass is very good, and it offers the highest case capacity, at 30.6 grains. Winchester brass is favored by many Highpower shooters. Current Hornady brass has shown very good uniformity (see chart). Brass Manufacturer Aver. Wt.\n\n(Sample) Extreme\n\nSpread Standard\n\nDeviation Lapua (new lot) 93.35 (100) 1.2 gr 0.31 gr Hornady 93.88 (50) 1.7 gr 0.43 gr Federal 96.28 (50) 2.3gr 0.75 gr Lake City '04 92.97 (50) 2.5 gr 0.61 gr WCC 99 95.5 (20) 2.9 gr 0.74 gr IMG (Guatemalan) 95.42 (25) 3.1 gr 0.88 gr PMP 104.4 (50) 3.9 gr 0.93 gr Radway 96.05 (50) 4.1 gr 0.89 gr PMC 93.48 (20) 4.6 gr 1.36 gr Remington 92.33 (50) 4.9 gr 0.85 gr Winchester 93.91 (44) 6.5 gr 0.96 gr\n\nThough .223 Rem rifles certainly benefit from being fed ultra-premium brass (i.e. Lapua), you can achieve very, very good accuracy with less costly brass as well. Graymist notes: \"Once-fired Lake City is great, and you can have excellent results with most of the commercial brass if you just sort it. Just don't expect it to hold up to a dozen or more reloadings like Lapua.\"\n\nFrom a reloading standpoint, the important thing to note is the rather substantial variance in case capacity from one brand of brass to another--as much as 2.6 grains! So, you cannot assume that a particular \"pet load\" will work if you change brass brands--you'll have to do new testing. Whenever you get a new batch of brass, you should measure at least a half-dozen to get the average actual H20 capacity. Compare this with your other cases. You may need to add or subtract powder to maintain a given velocity. Or, if you are already at max pressure levels, you will have to reduce the load if your new batch of brass has less capacity.\n\nFor varminters looking to acquire large numbers of cases at low cost there are some real bargains to be had. Wideners has NEW Guatemalan brass for just $89 per 1000 cases. This is good stuff, made on U.S. OLIN machinery exported to Latin America. MidwayUSA now offers Federal Lake City brass (item 197849) at $81.99 per 500. That works out to just $16.40 per hundred. Shooters report this brass is very uniform and shoots exceptionally well. Note, this is a discontinued itemso returns can only be made to Federal, not Midway. And Scharch Mfg. offers fully processed military brass (mostly Lake City), for $88.99 per thousand. This is once-fired brass has been reamed, cleaned, sized and trimmed to 1.75\".\n\n.223 Rem Case Weight vs. Capacity Case Manufacturer Case Weight* H20 Capacity** Lake City 06 92.0 30.6 WCC99 95.5 30.5 Sellier & Belloit 92.3 30.5 Remington 92.3 30.4 PMC 93.5 30.4 Hirtenberger 93.7 30.4 Lake City 04 93.0 30.4 Federal 96.3 30.2 Hornady 93.9 30.1 IMG (Guatemalan) 95.4 30.1 Lapua (new lot) 93.4 30.1 Winchester 93.9 30.1 Olympic 97.4 30.0 Radway Arsenal 96.1 30.0 PMP 104.5 29.9 FNM 93-1 97.3 29.8 Lapua (old lot) 104.0 28.0 .223 AI Case Capacities Lapua (old lot) 103.4 30.9 Winchester 95.5 32.2 Lapua (new lot) 93.4 32.4 Lake City 02 93.0 32.5\n\n* Average case weight of sized, deprimed, once fired brass (except new Lapua lot).

A spent primer was inserted in the primer pocket, the case weighed. Then the cases filled with distilled water to the top of the case mouth and weighed again.\n\nPowders\n\nThe .223 Remington is a reloader's dream. Not finicky, it shoots well with a wide variety of powders, both extruded (stick) and granular (ball). Ask a dozen .223 shooters and you'll probably get a dozen different powder recommendations. For the lighter bullets, H335 ball powder is a proven performer, and N133 shows outstanding accuracy. For 55gr to 60gr bullets, Benchmark, TAC, H4895, and AA2015 are excellent choices. For the 69gr and 77gr SMK, Sierra recommends VV N540 and N140 respectively. Finally, for the heaviest bullets, in the 80-90gr range, good choices include Reloader 15, VV N140, N550, and Varget. But there are many other good combinations. If you need a single, do-it-all powder for your .223 Rem loads, H4895, AA 2015, and TAC are all versatile and cost-effective. If you're loading with a progressive press, you'll find that ball powders such as H335, BLC-2, and TAC meter best.\n\nBullet Weight 35-50gr 50-60gr 60-70gr 70-80gr Recommended Powders H335, N133, RL10X AA 2015, Benchmark, H335, H4895, TAC AA 2520, N540, Varget Varget, Reloader 15, N140, N550\n\nPrimers The .223 Remington uses a Small Rifle primer. In a bolt gun you'll get good results from all the major brands: CCI, Federal, Remington, Winchester. The Rem 7 1/2s work very well with both stick and ball powders. Benchresters have shown a bias towards the Federal 205M (match), but in our informal testing, the CCI BR4s shot just as well as the Federals, while the CCIs delivered lower ES/SD with some powders. In fact, we've found that the \"plain Jane\" CCI 400s were closely matched with the much more expensive BR4s. Both can deliver good accuracy with low ES and SD. (Currently, at Powder Valley, CCI 400s cost $19.00 per thousand, while CCI BR4s cost $29.50 per thousand.) Some primers do seem to work better with particular powder/bullet combinations, so it's wise to do your own testing, and you may want to test CCI 400s vs. CCI BR4s head to head. You may find that the cheaper CCI 400s work just as well as the pricey BR4s in your gun.\n\nFor use in semi-automatics and AR15s, we advise that you stick to CCI and Remington primers. These brands have harder cups and are much less likely to pierce primers. Also, the AR15 has a free-floating firing pin that dents the primer on loading. This creates a risk of slam fires. So you want hard primer cups. The latest generation of Winchester primers, with brass-colored cups, should be avoided for AR15 use. The old silver Winchester primers worked fine, but the current WSRs are soft and can be pierced more easily than CCI or Rem primers. A poll of Highpower competitors (mostly shooting ARs) showed that Rem 7 1/2 primers are the most popular (33.23%), followed by CCIs (25.78%). The majority of CCI users favored the CCI BR4s, but both CCI 400s (small rifle standard) and CCI 450s (small rifle magnum) were also popular. Only 10.25% of Highpower shooters polled used Federal primers (either 205M or 205). At the time of the poll, many shooters reported using WSRs, but this was the older version with silver cups. See NationalMatch.us website for complete poll results.\n\nFor maximum protection against primer piercing and slam-fires, CCI also markets the #41 military primer. Possessing a very hard cup, with decreased sensitivity, #41 primers are designed to resist slam fires in rifles lacking firing pin retraction springs. In a bolt-gun or semi-auto AR-15, it is not necessary to use #41 military primers. But this is an appropriate option for some military applications.\n\nBullet Choices for the .223 Remington and .223 AI\n\nThe bullets used in the .223 Rem and .223 AI will be .224 diameter. The selection of .224 bullets is huge, likely bested only by the number of 30-caliber bullets available. On the light end, one can find nearly frangible bullets that almost vaporize when they hit the dirt, yet can withstand whatever velocity (and RPMs) the cartridge can throw at it. In this range you have the composite-core 36gr \"Varmint Grenade\" from Barnes, and the 40gr V-Max and BlitzKing offerings. These work very well on varmint sized critters as well, and usually don't exit. Check out this High-Speed Video Clip of a \"Varmint Grenade\" exploding upon impact as it hits a grape at 4344 fps. Barnes explains: \"Originally developed for military applications, the bullet's copper-tin composite core is highly frangible. The new FB, hollow-cavity bullet remains intact at ultra-high velocities, yet fragments explosively on impact--it virtually vaporizes ground squirrels and prairie dogs. The bullet blows up completely at high speed, creating little or no exit wound on larger animals.\" For a standard \"hunting\" bullet, Sierra offers its 65gr Game King, and Nosler its 60gr Partition, and Barnes has its Triple-Shock\" X-Bullet in 53, 62, and 70gr weights. The 70-grainer has good penetrating ability on medium-size game, but it does requires a 1:8\" or faster twist to stabilize.\n\nMatch Bullets\n\nFor close-range competition (100-300 yards) one can find a large variety of 50-53gn Match bullets, both custom made and commercial. The Sierra 52gr BTMK is a popular \"short-line\" load with Highpower shooters. Custom 52s in .224 caliber are offered by the benchrest bullet-makers, such as Bart Sauter, Lester Bruno, and Don Gentner. Lester also makes a very accurate 57. We've had very good luck with Bergers in the 50-65gr range. Berger offers a panoply of options, with Berger FB bullets offered in 50, 52, 55, 60, 62, and 64-grain weights. This wide selection lets you literally \"pick your BC\", from .241 for the 50, to .306 for the 64 grainer. If you're looking for do-it-all bullet that can shoot bugholes on paper and also perform in the varmint field, these Bergers will fit the bill.\n\nMid-Range (300-600 yard) Bullets For the mid-range match shooters there are even more options available in the 68-80gr weight range--many illustrated on this page. Check out the 69gr Lapua Scenar (.321 BC), 75 A-Max (.435 BC), and Berger 75gr VLD (.447 BC). Some guys have asked us: \"Please don't tell people about the 75 A-Max. Right now these are super cheap, and they shoot like a house on fire.\" The A-Maxs are indeed a major bargain. Midsouth Shooters Supply sells the 75gr A-Max for just $13.79/100, and the 80gr A-Max for $14.92/100. Sweet deal.\n\nLong-Range Match Bullets The 77gr and 80gr Sierra MatchKing are probably the \"default\" 22-Cal bullet choices among long-range Highpower shooters today, but we have heard many good reports about the 80gr A-Max and the 75gr and 80gr Berger Match VLDs. If you're shooting an 8-twist barrel at long range, you should try all the options and see what shoots best in your barrel. The new 90-grainers from Sierra and Berger caused a stir when introduced in 2006, but we haven't heard many reports from shooters using them in competition, possibly because one needs a very fast twist barrel (1:6.5\" is preferred), and the 80s already shoot so well. Robert Whitley tells us he rarely sees a 22-caliber shooter using anything heavier than an 80 in prone and Highpower matches. But that may change as more competitors acquire faster-twist barrels.\n\nChart based on max velocities (by bullet type) in Sierra Bullets' Load Manual for bolt-action .223 Remingtons.\n\nCommercial .223 Rem Ammo--New and Remanufactured\n\nThere is a vast array of new and re-manufactured factory ammo available, with bullets ranging from 35gr up to 80gr. For match purposes, the top three choices are Black Hills, Federal Gold Medal Match, and Lapua. For price and quality, it is hard to beat the Black Hills. David Tubb notes: \"Even though I normally had my own competitive ammo, on those occasions where I am required to shoot factory ammunition, I always try to pick the best. In my opinion Black Hills is unsurpassed.\" Black Hills sells a full line of .223 ammunition, including long-range match ammo loaded with 75gr HP, and 77 Sierra MK. Dennis DeMille won the 2003 National Service Rifle Championship shooting 77gr Black Hills ammo.\n\nBlack Hills also offers a wide range of Remanufactured Ammo, in bullet weights from 36 grains to 77 grains. Black Hills' reloads employ quality components and shoot nearly as well as the brand new ammo. You'll find good prices on Black Hills remanufactured ammo at Creedmoor Sports, and MidwayUSA.com. For example, Creedmoor Sports offers the remanufactured Black Hills with 77gr SMKs for $26.55 for 50 rounds. That's less than half the cost of new .223 Federal Gold Medal Match, which runs about $19 for 20 rounds.\n\nFor Varminters, Black Hills offers the following selection of remanufactured ammo:\n\nBullet 36 Vrmt Grenade 40 V-Max 50 V-Max 52 HP match 55 SoftPt 60 Nosler 60 V-Max Velocity 3750 fps 3600 fps 3300 fps 3250 fps 3200 fps 3100 fps 3100 fps\n\nLapua also offers excellent new ammo loaded with 55gr FMJ, 55gr SP, or 70gr HPBT match bullets. This is very good stuff (with the best .223 Rem brass available) but the 70 grainers are relatively expensive at $26.99 per box of 20 rounds from Grafs.com.\n\n.223 Rem Ackley Improved--More Speed, More Power\n\nWhy the AI? Some shooters own a half-dozen .223s and they just want to try something different. That natural curiousity can be reason enough to try a .223 Rem Ackley Improved. But there are also three very logical (and quantifiable) reasons to go with this chambering. Reason Number One is Speed. Depending on the powder, brass, and barrel length, the Ackley version of the .223 Remington will, typically, deliver from 100 to 140 fps more speed with any given bullet. (Light bullets gain more.) That makes a difference, particularly for varminters looking for a flatter trajectory and more explosive effect on target. Likewise, long-range shooters will benefit from improved ballistics. The AI's greater case capacity will let you run a given bullet faster, or let you step up to a heavier bullet with better BC. Reason Number Two is Brass Stability. The .223 Rem AI has a 40° shoulder. Once the cases are properly fire-formed, the steeper shoulder resists case growth. You'll find the AI brass is extremely stable and you won't have to trim the cases as often. Many .223 AI shooters also find they can reload the case many times before full-length sizing is required. Reason Number Three is Availability of Components. Compared to other \"hot rod\" cases such as the 22 Dasher or 22 PPC, .223 brass is cheap and plentiful. You can buy new IMG (Guatemalan) brass from Wideners for $89 per 1000 cases. Top Brass (Scharch Mfg.) offers fully processed, once-fired Lake City military brass for the same $89/1000. And many shooters already have an ample supply of .223 Rem commercial brass. Rather than let that old .223 brass languish--Ackleyize it. How Much Extra Powder Capacity Will I Get?\n\nThe .223 Remington is a compact case, with relatively limited case capacity. Ackleyizing the case adds roughly 7-8% to the capacity. The exact amount of the increase in case capacity depends on your brass and the reamer used to cut the chamber, but the range is between 2.2 grains and 2.8 grains. It's reasonable to figure you'll gain about 2.5 grains extra capacity. What About Dies?\n\nThe .223 Rem AI is the most popular of the Ackleyized cartridges. Hence a wide selection of dies is available. Redding, RCBS and Lee all sell .223 Rem AI (40° shoulder) sizing and seating dies. Wilson also makes inline seater dies and neck-sizing dies for use with arbor presses. Our current favorite set-up would be a Redding Type \"S\" full-length bushing die combined with a Wilson seater. While it's a good idea to have a full-length die (or body die), the stability of the .223 Rem AI case means that, if you avoid max loads, you can get by with just neck-sizing your brass for a few reloading cycles. This is one of the advantage of the Ackleyized case. The inexpensive Lee dies work fine. Graymist reports: \"Lee Pacesetter 223 AI dies were purchased through Midway for less than $26.00. The brass only has to fit in [my one 223 AI rifle], so unlike the 223 Remington brass I am only partially sizing the neck of the case. Runout has been under .002\" with the Lee dies. I recently had a friend run a 223 AI reamer in a Forster 223 Remington seating sleeve so I could use a Forster Ultra Seater die. The only real advantage with the Forster seating die is I can use the micrometer adjustment when seating different bullets.\" Where Can I Find 223 AI Load Data?\n\nApart from Graymist's .223 AI page, and Reloaders' Nest, there is limited online load info for the .223 Rem AI. Sierra plans to add a .223 AI section to its reloading manual, but that is still months away. Jason Baney has acquired a .223 Rem AI and we will be adding data to this page over time. But until all that info arrives, it's best to start with .223 Rem loads and work up. Since the .223 Rem AI only has about 8% more capacity than the parent case, the best thing to do is to start with a known, good load for the .223 Remington and then work up your AI load incrementally. With the light bullets and a fast powder such as H335, you'll probably use about 1.5 grains more powder in the Ackley case. But this is only a guideline. Since .223 Rem brass varies up to 2.6 grains in internal capacity from one headstamp to another, you'll have to work out your own best AI loads incrementally. What is the Best Method to Fire-Form the Cases?\n\nFire-forming .223 AI brass is very easy compared to some of the other Ackleyized wildcats. This is because the overall geometry doesn't change very dramatically other than the shoulder angle. You're not blowing the shoulder forward into the neck. Graymist simply loads a stout charge of H335 with 40gr V-Maxs: \"Fireforming was straight forward. Put the 223 cartridge in the rifle and pull the trigger. None of the complications I had when forming other Ackley Improved cartridges. I lost no cases when fireforming. Fireforming loads are superbly accurate, so don't waste them on punching paper. Form your brass while you hunt.\" Jason Baney, to save on barrel wear (and bullet costs), is fireforming using pistol powder and cornmeal: \"Try some Bullseye powder along with cornmeal and a patch to give you 95%+ formed cases. In my testing, I used 8 grains of Bullseye, topped with 12 grains of cornmeal (you have to settle it a little bit to fit it all in), with half a .22 caliber (1/2\" x1\") patch stuffed in the neck to secure the charge. This will give you a mostly AI-formed case with no bullet. The shoulders will not be as sharp as a case that has been 2-times-fired with a full-house load, but in my opinion, the cornmeal-forming procedure will help get to a true 'Ackley' load sooner. NOTE: Though there is no bullet, the cornmeal charge is still very dangerous--use the same precautions you would employ with normal ammunition. Likewise, use hearing protection.\" What Brass Should I Use?\n\nYou can get excellent results with many different brands--Lapua, Lake City, Hornady, Winchester, and IMG to name a few. But Graymist did an interesting comparison test in his .223 AI, comparing Lapua with Winchester: \"After fire forming, I recorded four groups with the Lapua brass. The average group size was .293\". (Individual groups ran .221\", .366\", .389\" and .195\"). The .293\" average Lapua group size is about .197\" smaller than the average of the six best groups fired previously in this rifle using Winchester brass.\" How does the Lapua brass hold up over time? \"After six firings the Lapua primer pockets remained tight, bolt closure was still easy, and no cases exceeded the 1.760\" maximum case length. (Most of the Lapua cases, when formed, measured 1.750\"). At $40.00 per 100, Lapua .223 Rem brass is two times more expensive than Winchester or Remington but it represents a substantial improvement in load consistency in my .223 AI. I will acquire more. It might also be noted that current lots of Lapua 223 brass are 10 grains lighter (with 2.1 grains more capacity) than the brass I used in this test.\"\n\n.223 Remington ARs for the VARMINT FIELDS AR15 and the .223 Remington\n\nThe combination of the .223 Remington and a scoped, heavy-barrel AR15 are a varmint's worst nightmare. A skilled shooter with an accurized AR can make quick work of a dog-town. The low-recoil, high-velocity .223 Rem cartridge, in a platform that allows immediate follow-up shots, is hard to beat as an efficient varmint eradicator. The AR's modular design permits you to easily change barrels by just pulling a couple of pins and swapping uppers. The AR is durable and relatively impervious to wet and cold. A vast inventory of accessories is available for it. Here's what our readers have to say about the AR in .223 Rem: \"I had a Colt Accurized Rifle that I used for groundhogs, called fox and an occasional coyote. The only change made to the rifle was a trigger job and a Harris bipod. It would put 55 grain Nosler Ballistic Tips into a 1/2\" circle faster than I could point and shoot. [I used] once-fired Lake City brass at couple cents a piece.... I really enjoyed that rifle--it was about as accurate as any production rifle I've owned--it wouldn't quite keep up with the Coopers but the second round was a whole lot faster.\"--Gunamonth \"I think the AR is the perfect varmint gun. If I were limited to only one gun and one gun forever it would be the AR. I shoot a lot of prairie dogs--while my friends with fancy single shots are trying to load another round, I will have four or five dogs down. Fast second shots count when you are shooting small dogs in the wind. Plus I can buy [quality] .223 ammo to shoot dogs, no reloading. The best thing about an AR is the fast follow-up shot. By the time you have reloaded a bolt rig for the second shot, the dog is long gone.\"--ChuckW2 \"The only bad thing about hunting with the AR-15 is that the hunts tend to be shorter, as the animals die so much faster!\"--Lance in Oregon \"When I was shooting so many prairie dogs, I had a custom AR built by Bill Wylde, his work is superb. I had a heavy Hart 28\" barrel installed on a Colt action with a custom set trigger. I could agg five 5-shot groups in the .285 area in a 9-twist. When shooting prairie dogs, I found that I simply wiped out the dogs in the areas that I was hunting in. My rifle weighed 15.5 lbs. with the heavy bbl, bird shot in the butt, and a heavy, flat plate on the forearm. It was simply a joy to shoot. I got rid of it because it was not fair for my hunting partner. When we would roll up on a dog town, the prairie dogs seemed to be feeding in groups. I would start off on the edge of the 'party' of dogs and work my way to the other side, killing most of them. I was shooting a round off every 6-8 seconds when working on a 'party' of dogs. Shooting the AR on a prarie dog town reminded me of the use of the Sharps rifle on a Buffalo herd...you just kill them all.\" --K. Candler Outfitting the Ultimate AR Varminter Out of the box, a standard AR15 is far from optimal for varminting. Right off the bat, you'll want to upgrade the trigger and fit a metal or carbon free-float tube. (These are available in either round or box section). A custom heavy barrel is a must for a serious varmint rifle--it adds accuracy and won't overheat as quickly. For most of us, when shooting from a bench or prone with a big scope, the standard AR stock is too short--it's hard to get correct eye relief and still keep the butt on your shoulder. Moreover, the standard buttstock isn't well suited for use in a rear sandbag (it has too much drop), and the rear sling swivel is a hindrance. We suggest you fit a buttstock with a straight section on the bottom to ride a rear sandbag, and adjustable length. The Magpul PRS (Precision Rifle Stock) offers both these features, plus an adjustable cheekpiece. Mounting large scopes on an AR can be problematic. Many varmint shooters use scopes with up to 30X max magnification. Most of these scopes need to be positioned pretty far forward to allow proper eye relief. You'll need a way to get that front ring out well ahead of the receiver. Here's a picture of Larry Medler's AR. Note how far forward the scope is positioned to give proper eye relief. A good AR varmint rifle will benefit from an extended scope rail that will allow you to move the whole scope forward. You can either use a cantilevered front mount such as the LaRue or an extended scope rail, such as the A.R.M.S. rail or the GG&G GS-1 unit shown at right. The GS-1 puts the scope far enough forward to allow proper eye relief without using long butt extensions that stretch the length of pull. Larry Medler also uses a metal plate attached to the float tube. This makes the whole rig much more stable when using a pedestal front rest. The plate can mount directly to the float tube or it can be attached to an accessory rail. It's relatively easy to build your own plate from aluminum or delrin. A set-up like this works well for F-Class competition as well as varminting. Last but not least, you'll want to some kind of brass-catching system to keep your valuable brass out of the weeds. There are both rigid and fabric brass catchers for the AR family of rifles. We like this simple mesh bag with a zipper at the bottom. It attaches with Velcro fasteners and costs less than $15.00 at CheaperThanDirt.com.

This handsome rifle features a vented forearm to aid in barrel cooling. All Montana Varminters have AA Claro Walnut stocks. Like all Cooper centerfire rifles, a Montana Varminter in .223 Remington or .223 Rem AI is guaranteed to deliver 1/2\" 3-shot groups at 100 yards using hand-loaded ammunition. MSRP for the Montana Varminter is $1459.00, while the basic Varminter costs $1198.00. The Model 700 VSSF-II represents one of the most capable rifles in Remington's inventory. A spin-polished stainless action is mated to a quality H-S Precision composite stock with an aluminum bedding block. The textured stock is colored black with green webbing and features a contoured beavertail fore-end with ambidextrous finger grooves, and twin front swivel studs to accommodate both a sling and a bipod. As a crowning touch, the flutes on the 26\" barrel are finished in matte black. Suggested retail for the VSSF-II is $1284.00, with street price around $1000.00 in .223 Rem. Long-favored by serious varminters, the Savage 12-BVSS is ready-to-run right out of the box. With a strong, pillar-bedded laminated stock, and fluted 26\" heavy barrel in 1:9\" twist, the single-shot 12-BVSS can often deliver 1/2-MOA groups with tuned handloads and can easily shoot under 1 MOA with factory ammo. The crisp, AccuTrigger\" can be adjusted down to about 1.5 pounds, so all you really need is to skim-bed the action and add a scope and you're ready for the varmint fields. MSRP for the 10-pound BVSS is $746.00, with street price under $630.00. The Howa 1500 Varminter Supreme is an excellent rifle for the price. You can often find the laminated Howa varminters for under $600.00 (MSRP is $711.00). The Varmint Supreme features a sturdy and very comfortable laminated stock with vent holes for barrel cooling. The action is strong and smooth, and the barrels are probably a bit better, on average, than you'll get from Remington.\n\n.223 Remington and .223 AI Load Map\n\nPowder Grains Primer Bullet Velocity Comments H322 25.3 Rem 7.5 40 Sierra BlitzK 3200 fps Sierra's Accuracy Load for AR15s.

  "latent_8352": "Editor's note: The killing of Osama bin Laden has changed everything. Or has it? In this ongoing series Al Qaeda: What's Next?, GlobalPost senior correspondents worldwide investigate the uncertain future of global terrorism and religious extremism – from Afghanistan to Egypt and Tunisia, India, China, Africa, Southeast Asia, the former Soviet republics and beyond.\n\nBEIJING, China — Even as he operated Al Qaeda from just across the border, Osama bin Laden never mentioned China’s Uighurs.\n\nNo expressions of sympathy, no condemnations of the Chinese government, no threats against China.\n\nYet America’s war on terrorism created a tougher atmosphere for China’s 10 million Muslim Uighurs, most of whom live in western Xinjiang province. The Chinese and U.S. governments agreed to cooperate on anti-terrorism efforts, even though the two countries face very different problems.\n\nIn the end, 22 Uighurs ended up at Guantanamo Bay, most of them rounded up in a training campaign in Afghanistan. (Most were later determined not enemy combatants.)\n\nEven today, Uighurs still face growing restrictions on practice of religion, travel and other areas of life. Rather than being pacified or quieted, thousands of China’s Uighurs erupted in deadly riots in 2009, partly in response to increasing government controls in the region.\n\nAs other nations have wrestled with threats posed by Muslim extremism, China faces a far more basic question: Does it actually have a radical Islam problem?\n\n“The burden of proof is on the Chinese government to convince the international community that it faces the threat of extremism,” said Henry K. Szadziewski, manager of the Washington, D.C.-based Uyghur Human Rights Project.\n\n“So far, the evidence presented has been unconvincing. It remains unconvincing because it has never been publicly examined by any kind of independent body inside of or outside of China,” he said.\n\nChina’s relationship with its 22 million Muslims is so complex and convoluted that there is basic disagreement over what makes an Islamic extremist.\n\nThe Chinese government contends that separatists among its Uighur population are extremists in the same category with Islamic terrorists elsewhere. But those separatists are not typically radical religious fundamentalists.\n\nRather, Uighurs are upset over more basic issues and rarely drawn to fundamentalism. Over the years, they’ve been blamed for sporadic bombings and other violence in the region, but religious fundamentalism is rarely at the core.\n\nExperts say the disagreement underscores the Chinese government’s own misunderstanding of Islam, and potentially of religion at large.\n\n“I think there is a vast chasm of ignorance of Islam in China and among Chinese people,” said Dru Gladney, a China and Uighur expert at Pomona College in California. “I do think there is a palpable sense of fear among Chinese government officials, scholars and even the general public about Islam, which they don’t understand.”\n\nGladney said the Hui Muslims, another large Muslim group in China often characterized as a patriotic minority, have been far more susceptible to strains of fundamentalism over the years.\n\nThe Uighurs, meanwhile, are central Asian. They typically practice a more laid-back brand of Islam, are frequently barred from international travel and much less prone to outside cultural influence.\n\nEven during the July, 2009 riots, Gladney pointed out, Uighurs were not calling for war against China.\n\n“The 2009 riots were quite revealing in that there was no mention of jihad or radical Islam,” said Gladney. “They were more interested in social justice and labor issues.”\n\nStill, China insists the riots and unrest in Xinjiang are the work of outside agitators and extremists. But even by their definition, fundamentalism is very different than elsewhere.\n\n“Extremism has a long-term and slow effect on people’s minds,” said Professor Li Wei of the China Institute of Contemporary International Relations, a government-affiliated think-tank. “When the riots erupted, they had already been affected by extremist attitudes. That made them more susceptible to other ideas.”\n\nLi said by China’s definition, extremists reject government policies including limits on the number of children they can have, economic development and education practices. The real threat, he admits, is separatism.\n\nWith bin Laden dead, America’s need for Chinese support in the fight against terrorism could diminish, said Gladney. The road ahead in China is uncertain, but it’s clear the government isn’t going to ease up on Xinjiang.\n\nSzadziewski said five days after bin Laden’s death, China conducted anti-terrorism drills in Kashgar, the old Silk Road oasis and heart of Uighur culture.\n\n“The impact will mostly be felt in how China frames the terror threat it faces to the outside world,” he said. “After the death of Osama bin Laden, China is likely to re-up the rhetoric of Muslim extremism to demonstrate that it is confronted with a significant threat.”",
  "latent_8414": "U.S. Open Cup by Jonah Fontela on Apr 3, 2018\n\nThe Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup is an unbroken thread that runs from the early 20th century to today. From the industrial leagues of the 1920s and 30s, to the ethnic flavor of the post-World War II era, and the dominance of MLS since the league’s birth in 1996, the Open Cup tells the confusing, chaotic and unlikely story of soccer’s success on American shores. Join ussoccer.com for a look at the Cup from the good old days when there were laces on the ball, up to the gleaming professionalism we know now.\n\nWay, way back\n\nThe first U.S. Open Cup was played in 1914, making it the oldest cup competition for soccer in the United States and the country’s oldest annual tournament for team sports. While professional soccer came and went in various forms and incarnations, at various stages of the 20th century, the Open Cup crowned a champion for each of the last 104 years. Even through the want and woe of the Great Depression and the challenges of two World Wars, the U.S. Open Cup survived. Teams from 17 different states have won the title.\n\nBrooklyn beginnings\n\nThe first final took place at Coates Field in Pawtucket, Rhode Island, contested by a pair of teams from the New York City borough of Brooklyn. Brooklyn Field Club edged Brooklyn Celtic 2-1. Celtic returned to the final the next year only to be beaten by powerhouses Bethlehem Steel, who hold the joint-record of most titles with five. In all, eight teams with Brooklyn in their name have won the Open Cup.\n\n(1921 National Challenge Cup/U.S. Open Cup champions Brooklyn Robins Dry Dock)\n\nOnce there were two\n\nOnly once in the long history of the U.S. Open Cup has a champion not been established on the pitch. That was in 1923, when FC Paterson became the first team from New Jersey to win the title. Scullin Steel of St. Louis were unable to field a side for a replay after the initial Final finished tangled at 2-2. In what might be the most American of soccer problems Scullin claimed they couldn’t play again because many of the young men in their side were making preparations for the upcoming professional baseball season.\n\nName game\n\nThe competition was known as the National Challenge Cup from 1914 to 1999, when it was renamed and dedicated to MLS owner and American soccer pioneer Lamar Hunt. From then on it became the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. In 2016, FC Dallas, who are owned and operated by Hunt’s sons Clark and Dan, gave the trophy a homecoming of sorts when they defeated New England Revolution 4-2 in the tournament final played at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas\n\nThe Open Cup’s greatest?\n\nMany legends of American soccer have graced the stages of the U.S. Open Cup through the years. Perhaps none shine as bright as the mustachioed and lethally left-footed Billy Gonsalves, who won the Cup a record eight times with four different teams. In 1931, Glasgow Celtic manager Willie Maley said, without hesitation: “This Billy Gonsalves is the greatest player I’ve ever seen.” Sometimes called the Babe Ruth of American Soccer, this son of Portuguese immigrants and the seventh of nine children, Gonsalves lined up for the U.S. Men’s National Team in both the 1930 and 1934 FIFA World Cups.\n\n(Bert Patenaude of Fall River Marksmen, scorer of a first-ever World Cup hat-trick, heading (in stripes) in the 1930 Final)\n\nIndustrial giants\n\nEmployer-owned teams dominated the 1920s and 30s, with industrialists in the Northeast and Midwest importing talented foreign players with the promise of good jobs and soccer on the side. Bethlehem Steel won five titles between 1914 and 1924. The likes of St. Louis Ben Miller, named after a prominent hat company, Brooklyn Robbins Dry Dock, St Louis Scullin Steel, Todd Shipyards, Vesper Buick, Holley Carburator, Manhattan Beer, Morgan Strasser and St Louis Stix, Baer & Fuller all made their mark on the competition.\n\nA rich broth of backgrounds\n\nIt’s impossible to untangle ethnicity and soccer in a country of immigrants like the United States. Many Open Cup champions were teams formed by newcomers, proud of their native land and their adoptive home, and eager to meld the two in the form of a soccer club. The result of this most American of hybrids are champions with names that span the old world and the new, like New York Hakoah – champions of 1929, who took their name from the Hebrew word meaning Strength. Philadelphia German-American SC won in 1936 and Chicago Sparta two years after. Among the list of Open Cup winners are: Brooklyn St. Mary’s Celtic, Brooklyn Hispano, New York German-Hungarians, SC Eintracht, Philadelphia Ukrainian Nationals, New York Hungaria, New York Ukrainians, New York Greek-American, New York Hota, Los Angeles Maccabee, New York Pancyprian-Freedoms, Brooklyn Italians, DC’s Club España and San Francisco Greek-American.\n\nOld NASL opt out\n\nThere’s no matching the North American Soccer League of the 1970s and early 80s for over-the-top glitz and glamor. During the league’s salad days, when global superstars like Johan Cruyff, Franz Beckenbauer, George Best and Pele, came to play in the USA, the league declined to take part in the U.S. Open Cup. Theories abound as to why the likes of the New York Cosmos, Chicago Sting and LA Aztecs refused to play, the most plausible being that those big-timers wanted to avoid the possibility of being beaten by smaller fish. “They [the NASL sides] didn’t want to run the risk of losing to amateurs,” Dr. Joe Machnik, Open Cup champion in 1965 with NY Ukrainians, recently told ussoccer.com.\n\n(1965 U.S. Open Cup Champions NY Ukrainians, Dr. Joe Machnik 2nd from right Standing)\n\nMajor-League dominance\n\nRomance be damned! Since the inception of Major League Soccer in 1996, teams from the country’s top flight have dominated the U.S. Open Cup. Only once since then has a team from below the summit of the United States’ soccer pyramid won the competition, when the Rochester Rhinos beat four MLS teams to claim the crown in 1999. The Charleston Battery also reached the final in 2008, but fell 2-1 to D.C. United. With four titles each, Chicago Fire, 2017 holders Sporting Kansas City and Seattle Sounders FC lead the pack of MLS clubs, followed by D.C. United, FC Dallas and LA Galaxy (2 each) and Columbus Crew SC and New England Revolution (1 each).\n\nTravails of a Trophy\n\nThe 62 winners of the U.S. Open Cup all have their names etched on the base of the Sir Thomas Dewar Cup. The trophy was donated by whiskey magnate and soccer promoter Sir Thomas Dewar in 1912. The original trophy was retired in 1979 due to the damage sustained over a long life of being grasped by grateful hands. But the Dewar Cup came back out of retirement for a brief revival in 1997 and was last awarded to the Chicago Fire when they won the 2006 tournament.\n\nFlirting with long-ago legends\n\nReigning champions Sporting Kansas City, Chicago Fire and Seattle Sounders are all on the cusp of equaling the record of most wins in Open Cup history. Another title for any one of these four-time champions would bring them level with Bethlehem Steel and Maccabee Los Angeles, a club formed by Israeli ex-pats, Holocaust survivors among them, who dominated the 1970s and early 80s with their five championship runs. Fall River Marksmen and Philadelphia Ukrainians both have four titles to their name, but are currently defunct. The other four-time champs, New York Greek Americans, are not among the participating teams in 2018.\n\n(Sporting Kansas City are reigning Open Cup champs and one more title would make it 5 and tie them for most ever)\n\nDavids and Goliaths\n\nThe romance of the U.S. Open Cup derives, in large part, from its format as a single-elimination competition open to all affiliated professional and amateur teams in the United States. $300,000 in prize money (up from $250,000 last year) is on offer to the winner of the 2018 event, an unfathomable amount for the hopeful amateurs from the Open Division. And while a non-Major League Soccer side hasn’t won since the Rochester Rhinos did in 1999, the dream of a fairytale scramble to the Final is a spur for those small sides who play for the love of the game. Financial inducements don’t stop with the champions, either, as the runner-up collects $100,000 (up from $60,000 last year) and the team that advances farthest from each lower division gets $25,000 (up from $15,000 last year).\n\nDoorway to the international arena\n\nThe winner of the U.S. Open Cup qualifies directly for the CONCACAF Champions League (formerly the CONCACAF Champions Cup), a tournament of the league champions and cup winners from North, Central America and the Caribbean. The CONCACAF Champions League has only ever been won on two occasions by American teams (both from MLS) – DC United in 1998 and LA Galaxy in 2000.\n\n94 for 2018\n\n94 teams will participate in the 2018 edition of the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup. Among the sides in the 105th installment of the competition are reigning champions Sporting Kansas City and 19 other Major League Soccer outfits. There are 22 teams from the officially recognized Division II United Soccer League (USL), including Charleston Battery, who, in 2008, became the last non-MLS team to reach the Final. Among the brigade of amateur combatants, Christos FC of Baltimore are back for a second straight time and hoping to match their run to the Fourth Round at #USOC2017, where they earned the chance to play D.C. United of Major League Soccer.",

That’s the opposite of how it works in most other first-person games, where you click the left stick to run.\n\nThere’s a simple solution for this issue. While No Man’s Sky itself doesn’t let you remap the controls, you can get around that by going directly into the PS4’s settings. Sony’s version 2.50 firmware update for the console, released in March 2015, added a number of accessibility options to the system — including the ability to reassign buttons on the DualShock 4 controller.\n\nGo into the Accessibility section of the PS4’s settings menu, then scroll down to Button Assignments. Check the box that says \"Enable Custom Button Assignments,\" then go into \"Customize Button Assignments.\" Go down to the L button, then press X to reassign it to the R button. (Don’t worry: This will only swap L3 and R3, not the sticks themselves.)\n\nVoilà! Now when you play No Man’s Sky, you’ll click the left stick to sprint. The function that was formerly assigned to that button — the environment scanner — will be on R3 instead.\n\nWe should note that there’s a major drawback to this. Any controller remapping that you do in the PS4’s accessibility settings is a global change; the console doesn’t allow you to create sets of button assignments on a game-by-game basis. That means that your L3 and R3 buttons will be swapped in every game, unless you manually switch them back whenever you want to play something besides No Man’s Sky. (We’ve asked Hello Games if there are any plans to add button remapping to the game, and we’ll update this article with any information we receive.)\n\nIt’s a good thing, then, that No Man’s Sky is the only game we’re going to play for the rest of our lives.\n\nFor more on No Man’s Sky, check out our impressions of the first 10 hours.",

All of this would require a duplicate Julian Assange cloned body double you say? Well, the CIA has had four years to find and train one. And the CIA has twice before fooled billions of people around the world with two body doubles of Saddam Hussein and their best achievement ever - OSAMA BIN LADEN who was played by an American named Tim Osman ultimately discovered and exposed by LA Detective Michael Rupert and 20 year veteran FBI Chief Ted Gunderson... Here is how the CIA did it before, and how they are doing it now with Julian Assange:\n\nAs for the technology to use body doubles, and produce very convincing fake videos, the CIA has demonstrated a history of using them in the past. The most famous being with Bin Laden. This is what my husband and I believe to be the truth after reviewing all the links of the OP, and seeing how the CIA fooled America twice before with fake videos and body doubles. Check this out\n\nhttp://www.infowars.com/former-cia-officials-admit-to-faking-bin-laden-v... and about the body doubles used by the CIA before:\n\nhttp://humansarefree.com/2011/05/proof-that-osama-bin-laden-was-cia-and.... and\n\nhttps://tatoott1009.com/2015/09/22/st-germain-drops-911-bombshell-proof-... and\n\nhttp://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,185240,00.html, and last but not least is what 20 year veteran former FBI Chief whistle blower Ted Gunderson said about it all\n\nhttp://educate-yourself.org/cn/2001/riconosciutoandtimosman8nov01.shtml\n\nAnd at the time they grabbed Julian, the world's attention was super focused upon him and waiting every day for his next bombshell leak. Obama freaked out when he realized his own CIA was feeding the leaked material (Confirmed by Dr. Steve Pieczenik) and realized it was just a few more days before the 80,000 pages of FBI reports on 911 connections to the Saudi government would be the next bombshells. They had to do something. So they \"rendered\" him after Ecuador refused to give him up. Only a few days before Julian was snatched by the CIA, Obama went on TV and declared officially that \"Assange was a wanted terrorist\". IMO, he did this to have legal grounds to buts into the Ecuador Embassy by force and take Assange. When the Ecuadorians planned and prepared to protest at the UN, the biggest electrical blackout in Ecuador history took place as Obama made veiled threats and demonstrated the power of American technology.\n\nAnyway, this is what Nancy & her husband figured out after reading all the above on the net over the last 12 hours. ::::: http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/julian-assange-wikileaks-was-about-expose-...\n\nDid you take the time to review this quasi-evidence?\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IH4SiQlNviQYouTube\n\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/WhereIsAssange/comments/5infkg/proof_hannity_as...\n\nhttp://www.godlikeproductions.com/forum1/message3415012/pg1?disclaimer=1\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cjEVTE9EhuEYouTube\n\nhttp://www.opnlttr.com/letter/was-sean-hannity-also-duped-fake-interview...\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ohmajJTcpNkYouTube\n\nhttps://wn.com/10_reasons_julian_assange_is_dead_or_compromised_proofofl...\n\nThe ONLY reason the U.S. government would keep Julian alive would be to torture him to give up his government leaker sources and-or his encryption keys. I don't think they could buy him, unless they took his family hostage or killed one of his relatives as a threat. Or maybe they already did that when one of his associates supposedly jumped in front of a train recently?\n\nBtw... do you remember about 15 years ago an FBI Lab supervisor named Frederic Whitehurst blew the whistle on how the FBI faked hundreds of lab reports to convict over 1,000 innocent people? Well, read the book of a man named Kessler called THE SECRETS OF THE FBI. In this book Kessler documented, and the FBI finally admitted two things, (1) The FBI has NO EVIDENCE linking Bin Laden to 911 and (2) That the FBI could not match the fingerprints of the Bin Laden that was buried at Sea! Dr. Steve Pieczenik and nine retired CIA agents have all confirmed that Osama Bin Laden and Tim Osman were both CIA employees for many years going back to the days of the Russian invasion of Afghanistan.\n\nOh yeah... Renditions are no big deal for the CIA. If you recall they used to do a few every week about 5 years ago, and didn't get busted until after they had already swiped and tortured 3 dozen people. Julian Assange was like shooting fish in a barrel for them. Here is the time line up and until I realized something very foul and sishy took place: http://www.opnlttr.com/letter/public-warning-wikileaks-now-run-cia-techn...\n\nThe bottom line is that anything other than fingerprints and DNA can and has been faked many times BEFORE and NOW with again with Julian Assange. People are welcome to disagree, but then I would ask you to disprove the 30 reasons Anonymous puts forth that Julian was rendered in this amazing video www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZlpqYMpOOD0. Btw... the OP links sets the legal standards of positive identification used by the courts.\n\nNow that you know the above, let me borrow from Scam.com ...\n\n\"Prior to the CIA rendition of the REAL Julian Assange on October 16th, 2016, Julian Assange made public proclamations as you can see here below and in the OP Link to expose the following bombshell leaks;\n\n* Insurance Files of Anthony Wiener\n\n* Treason of Hillary Clinton\n\n* Crimes of Google\n\n* Child Trafficking\n\n* Dirt on Rupert Murdoch crimes\n\n* Eric Braverman & The Clinton Foundation\n\nAll of the above were supposedly huge and enough to get Hillary Clinton and others indicted. He was, at the time just starting to expose Huma Abedin as a Saudi spy and was hinting that he had some or all of the 80,000 FBI documents that confirme what the New York POst had already reported... The Saudi government paid for the 911 attacks, which several retired CIA agents have already confirmed to be an inside job.\n\nSince October 16th, 2016 however, there has been no mention of these \"bombshell leaks\" ever again by Julian Assange nor Wikileaks. Why? Here is your answer: http://www.geoworldnews.com/fears-gr...anamo-express/\n\nHere is what is coming out NOW that the REAL Julian Assange had promised to disclose belore the election:\n\nhttp://www.inquisitr.com/3676883/lat...n-as-a-result/ Just search George Webb, child trafficking, Haiti, video\n\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/media/20...rupert-murdoch\n\nhttp://www.wnd.com/2015/10/clinton-f...ng-earthquake/\n\nhttp://forbiddenknowledgetv.net/clin...ll-film-27772/\n\nhttp://www.opnlttr.com/letter/julian...et-cut-hillary\n\nThose who think a body double is laughable only need to read this here that shows how the CIA fooled over 3 billion people once before using an American named Tim Osman to become Osam Bin Laden to make some convincing fake videos: https://www.reddit.com/r/POLITIC/com...ting_my_valid/\n\nAlso remember that Edward Snowden, Dr. Steve Pieczenik, Alex Jones, and Jim Stone all REFUSE to confirm that the real Julian Assange is sitting in the Ecuador Embassy in London (They have been served gag orders). But Anonymous is not holding back as you can see here: www.youtube.com/watch?v=qqLZgWudtI4\n\nAnd... prior to October 16th, 2016, the real Julian Assange insisted that all communitions from Wikileaks and himself must be signed with a PGP code key to be considered as genuine. Yet since October 16th, 2016, NONE of the communications from \"Julian Assange\" nor Wikileaks have been signed with their PG key!\n\nOne last question...

Ultimately, it aims to really take a strong look into the many issues that inhibit the StarCraft community and E-Sports culture.\n\nPosted on April 3, 2013\n\nWith the announcement of the StarCraft II World Championship Series (2013) made public, many questions and excitement have arose around the scene. Teams, fans and organizers are both delighted with what’s been planned, but also anxious to see how it’ll further the reach of the idea of E-Sports. We called for the idea back in November, 2012 under the article name:with hope that something similar to WCS would be pushed forward to help all scenes and their players prosper and rank amongst one another:\n\n“But at the same time, there is definitely a lack of outlets for foreign players to shine and rank themselves amongst one another with a monetary prize-finish at the end. The suggestion of regional-prized tournaments ranging from different levels helps alleviate the frustrations for many players and connect them back with challengers they can build off from one another.\n\n[…] A good mix of region-based leagues and international tournaments creates a balanced and constant cycling of both aspiring professional players and levels of champions from local to national to international. With a more gradual spread of tournaments, there should be a result of less emphasis on having a Korean (currently the best players) on your team and more demand for foreigners to improve instead of becoming the marketing extremity. This will also add more stable grounds for smaller teams to compete rather than rely on mercenaries to compensate (Team Legion, Check-Six, Alt-Tab) for roster inadequacies.”\n\nThis World Championship Series from Blizzard is definitely in the right step, but also has various drawbacks. Their reasons to create this season World Championship Series is a dilemma readers and fans are probably already familiar with:\n\n“First, while the abundance of tournaments spawned tons of lively competition, it also made it difficult for players and teams to avoid scheduling conflicts. More importantly, for spectators, there was nothing tying the events together to create a unified storyline, and it was hard to identify who the best players were from week to week.”\n\nCreates an even schedule of multiple seasons, allowing for proper budgetary planning and scheduling for players and teams (I expect contracts to be drawn up less annually and more every two seasons, especially with newer recruits).\n\nIt creates regional champions and helps teams earn reputation and reward for their players (see: Minor Tournaments – A Progamer’s Resume [Jan. 2013])\n\nLimits power struggles between organizations and the need to “one-up” one another through amount of prize-pool (to thus attract popular progamers) and other tactics.\n\nEasy system to rank players regionally and worldwide to know who really is the best not through number of achievements, but through consistent performance and ranked points.\n\nAllows the possibility of new champions rising and recycles those who longer are ahead of the curve.\n\nNASL (NA), DreamHack (EU) and Proleague (KeSPA) [KR] will likely be part of the scoop of points attributed to WCS rankings and seeds, it also means they are considered second-class events due to their less impactful effect on a WCS season.\n\nThis point-system also means that any other tournament organizations looking to get involved in StarCraft II will have a steeper climb to reach relevancy.\n\nMinor tournaments will likely see even less activity and participation as WCS online components of participation will attract many aspiring players (since it is more likely to attract a major team’s attention: see; Minor Tournaments – A Progamer’s Resume [Jan. 2013])\n\nEvents that are not associated with WCS nor receiving points to attribute to WCS seedings will have to fit their events within the championship series (and also create a reason why people should watch it).\n\n[we wrote the same things in(Dec. 2012) and(Nov. 2012)]Indeed, as explained in the 2013 WCS overview, this system not only creates a proper boundary schedule for any person’s career (between April and November), it also allows for tournament organizations to properly line up their event for equal distribution of fan-interest as well as high-player attendance (both from the reputable players to the aspiring ones).In 2010 and 2011, Blizzard was in the background, delegating power and rights to various groups to establish a base of major tournaments and organizations. 2012 and 2013, they shifted away from a background position to being the forefront and captain of the E-Sports boat. Their semi-RIOT LCS (League of Legends) and FGC EVO (fighting games) system enables a consistent format for spectators to comprehend. It streamlines importance for all events of all regions equally and events within WCS (ESL, MLG, GSL, OGN/OSL and Proleague) grant seedings to WCS Season Finals. Here are some of the positives that WCS entails:The drawbacks to this system are evident, but were also inevitable as the scene expanded beyond its capability and reached. What people called “oversaturation” was merely a race to be relevant and a staple to the E-Sport. MLG, ESL and OGN/GSL are clearly the winners here and while Blizzard’s point-system can also be attributed to non-WCS events, it also means the following:As stated, the drawbacks are minor given the downward slope in terms of number of new tournaments and competitions being created. The online portion of WCS will also attract cheaters and potential hackers, but that is something that is both inevitable and small in exchange for convenience and widening the ability to attract as many new competitors as possible.The truth of it all is that Blizzard’s World Championship Series is a step in the right direction, few disagree, many don’t agree with some of the smaller issues such as the pseudo-region lock. Such as ways to bypass the system in which Koreans will be in North American system knowing they are not up to snuff to prevail in the GSL/OSL and Proleague. The point system can also be trouble if improperly balanced where we may see another Pool Play issue (players who have not been succeeding, continue to maintain seedings and points due to their achievement many months ago). In short, the faults and issues with the World Championship Series are both minor and hastening the process that was occurring already, the upside to it all is that the prize-money is elevated, the opportunity to compete is less costly and stories are created. With Blizzard’s WCS, the foundation of competition is elevated and the next step for StarCraft II has begun!",
  "latent_8680": "In 2003, the disease-causing gene for congenital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS) was discovered in the pairedlike homeobox gene PHOX2B, located at exon 3 on chromosome 4. According to American Thoracic Society (ATS) guidelines, a mutation in the PHOX2B gene is required for the diagnosis of CCHS. The normal PHOX2B contains a 20-alanine coding repeat region (20/20). An increased number of polyalanine repeats in this region is referred to as polyalanine repeat expansion mutation (PARM). There can also be nonpolyalanine repeat mutations (NPARMs), which consist of missense, nonsense, or frameshift mutations. Over 90% of patients with CCHS are heterozygous for a PARM in the PHOX2B gene, which can range from 24-33 alanines, the most common being 25, 26, and 27, referred to as 20/25, 20/26, 20/27, respectively. The remaining 10% have anNPARM. [1]\n\nStudies have shown a correlation that with increasing expansion of alanines, the need for continuous ventilatory support increases. In general, individuals with 25-PARM rarely require 24-hour ventilatory support, those with 26-PARM have a variable need for ventilatory support during the awake periods based on their activity levels, and those with 27-33–PARMs require 24-hour ventilatory support. Mild- and late-onset CCHS has been associated with 24-polyalanine and 25-PARMs. [2]\n\nIndividuals with NPARMs have a more severe phenotype, which may require continuous ventilatory support, and they are also at higher risk of having Hirschsprung disease and neural crest tumors.\n\nThe PHOX2B gene codes for a transcriptional factor responsible for regulating expression of genes involved with the development of the autonomic nervous system, such as dopamine-β-hydroxylase (DBH), PHOX2A, and TLX-2. [1] Increased PRAM has been shown to impair the PHOX2B protein's ability to regulate the transcription of these genes. The mutated PHOX2B protein also interferes with the activity of the normal PHOX2B on the other chromosome. [3]\n\nGenetics\n\nCCHS can be from autosomal dominant inheritance or a de novo mutation. Some parents of CCHS patients have been found to have a somatic mosaicism for the PHOX2B mutation. [4] In one study looking at 45 CCHS families, nearly 20% of patients inherited the mutation from somatic mosaicism. [5]\n\nCertain PARMs, such as 24 and 25, have an autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. [1, 6] Therefore, the degree to which family members of individuals with CCHS may have evidence of respiratory control or autonomic dysfunction remains uncertain. [7] The extreme variability that can be seen in a family is demonstrated by a case series in which the initial patient is found to have CCHS with an NPARM and most other members with the same mutation are mildly affected (constipation, autonomic dysfunction, sleep apnea) and identified later in childhood or after the initial patient was diagnosed. [8]\n\nA disturbance of cardiac autonomic regulation in CCHS may indicate the possibility of PHOX2B genotype in relation to the severity of dysregulation, predict the need for cardiac pacemaker, and offer the clinician the potential to avert sudden death. [9]\n\nEnvironmental influences have been suggested to affect the presentation of siblings with CCHS. One study of monozygotic term male twins with identical 25-PARMs showed differing clinical courses, with twin B having more severe respiratory compromise at birth and twin A exhibiting a relatively benign course until beginning to require more noninvasive ventilator support at around age 5 years. [10]\n\nStructural central nervous system abnormalities\n\nBased on the initial premise that CCHS is associated with a centrally located defect, multiple attempts have been made over the years to identify structural CNS abnormalities. Research in rodent models, indicating the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) as the main area of PHOX2B activity, has been confirmed with PHOX2B immunoreactivity in human fetuses and infants. [11]\n\nMRI changes indicating alterations or injury have been observed in the caudate nuclei in patients with CCHS. [12] Reduced gray matter volume over time in areas regulating autonomic, mood, motor, and cognition functions have been shown in CCHS patients. These areas include the prefrontal and frontal cortex, caudate nuclei, insular cortex, and cerebellar regions. [13] The pathologic process leading to these brain injuries is unknown but is thought to be caused by hypoxic mechanisms or due to sustained perfusion issues. The MRI scan of a premature infant with PHOX2B mutation showed deep cerebral white matter destruction with lesions concentrated in the internal capsule and corpus callosum. The infant’s pattern of damage (which is usually seen in patients with some degree of birth asphyxia) suggests that these signs of restricted cerebral perfusion may be a byproduct of autonomic neural dysfunction in CCHS resulting in impaired vascular control. [14]\n\nPhysiologic abnormalities of ventilatory control\n\nMost patients with CCHS are able to maintain adequate spontaneous ventilation during wakefulness as a result of residual peripheral chemoreceptor function in these patients.\n\nCCHS is characterized by dysfunction in the metabolic control of breathing; therefore, more severe gas-exchange disturbances occur during non–rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. This is clearly in contrast with other respiratory disorders associated with sleep-disordered breathing, such as obstructive sleep apnea syndrome, in which gas-exchange abnormalities preferentially occur during REM sleep.\n\nVentilatory sensitivity to hypercarbia and hypoxemia in CCHS has been found to be detectable, but weaker than in controls. This is thought to be due to deficit of central chemosensors with preservation of peripheral chemosensors. Differences in the cerebrovascular responses of CCHS patients and controls during hypoxic hypercapnic challenges suggest there is a dysregulation of cerebral autoregulation in CCHS patients. They also appear to not react to hypercarbia and hypoxemia, while controls have labored breathing and anxiety. [15]\n\nFindings during non-REM sleep suggest that the intrinsic defect in CCHS is always present but becomes more prominently expressed during conditions in which other redundant mechanisms are either less active or inoperative. [16]\n\nIn addition, noradrenergic dysregulation has been reported in human pathologies affecting the control of breathing, such as sudden infant death syndrome, congenital central hypoventilation syndrome, and Rett syndrome. Noradrenergic neurons are located predominantly in pontine nuclei. Severe respiratory disturbances associated with gene mutations affecting noradrenergic neurons have been reported (PHOX2 and MECP2).\n\nEfforts are attempting to understand the biochemical basis for PHOX2B mutation. Task2 potassium channel expression in the RTN region appears to be affected by reactive oxygen species generated during hypoxia. [17]",

  "latent_9065": "When President Donald Trump delivered a tough warning to North Korea on Tuesday, he was following in the footsteps of one of America’s greatest statesmen. As numerous Washington pundits have now noted, Trump’s threat to unleash “fire and fury” on North Korea bears strong resemblance to JFK’s historic “Prepare To Be Radioactive Skeletons, Motherfuckers” speech that he delivered during the Cuban Missile Crisis.\n\nAt the peak of the Cold War, tensions were high, and even a slight miscalculation by President Kennedy could have plunged the world into nuclear conflict. JFK knew that he had to deliver a precise, carefully crafted message to peacefully end the standoff, so he went on national television and vowed to “wipe Cuba off the goddamn map with a hellfire tsunami that’ll char Havana into a glowing ash heap” and “turn every last Cuban man, woman, child, and pet dog into a red-hot screaming skeleton, you better fucking believe it.” Firm and calm in his delivery, he went on to say that after he bombed Cuba he would “pay a personal visit to the smoldering rubble to piss all over Fidel’s corpse and plant an American flag in his empty eye socket” and then “nuke the junk-ass country all over again just for shits and giggles.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt was a masterful stroke of diplomacy, one that Trump is now clearly trying to channel through his own rhetoric to persuade Kim Jong-un to abandon his nuclear ambitions.\n\nWith delicately calibrated language, JFK also issued a stark warning to the Soviet Union, cautioning that if Cuba continued housing Russian ballistic missiles, then “the U-S-fucking-A will shove our red-white-and-blue atomic boner straight up Khrushchev’s asshole and fuck him until that leering commie mutant has Uncle Sam’s nuclear jizz spraying out his mouth.” It was a stern yet diplomatic declaration that said exactly what was needed in order to pull the world back from the brink of annihilation, and it seems that Trump is now taking pages from the same playbook.\n\nAs Donald Trump continues to manage the escalating North Korean nuclear program, it’s reassuring to know that he’s taking guidance from one of history’s finest orators. With Trump following JFK’s example, we can all take comfort knowing that the horrors of nuclear war will not be inflicted upon humanity.",
  "latent_9144": "BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Al Qaeda gunmen seeking to form a radical Islamic state out of the chaos of Syria’s civil war are fighting hard to reconquer the province they once controlled in neighboring Iraq, stirring fears the conflict is exporting ever more instability.\n\nExploiting local grievances against Baghdad’s rule and buoyed by al Qaeda gains in Syria, the fighters have taken effective control of Anbar’s two main cities for the first time since U.S. occupation troops defeated them in 2006-07.\n\nTheir advance is ringing alarm bells in Washington: The United States has pledged to help Baghdad quell the militant surge in Anbar — although not with troops — to stabilize a province that saw the heaviest fighting of the U.S. occupation.\n\nWashington announced it was speeding up deliveries of military equipment to help Baghdad fight the gunmen. This would include missiles, surveillance drones and helicopters.\n\nAl Qaeda’s Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has a tough potential foe in Anbar’s well-armed tribes, fellow Sunnis ill-disposed to ceding power to al Qaeda even if they share ISIL’s hostility to the Shi’ite-led central government.\n\nAnd the group’s goal of creating a hardline Islamic state reaching into Syria is still seen by many as far-fetched.\n\nBut its high-profile push into Ramadi and Falluja illustrates the dangers of conflict spreading from Syria’s three-year-old conflict, which is in part a proxy war between Sunni Muslim Saudi Arabia and Shi’ite rival Iran, analysts say.\n\nISIL fighters operate in Syria as well, and recent setbacks for the group in the war there mean its Iraqi members may be all the more determined to secure gains in Anbar, analysts say.\n\n“Both the Syrian and the Iraqi conflict are feeding upon one another,” said Fawaz Gerges, a Middle East expert at the London School of Economics.\n\n“RAGING FIRE”\n\n“There is already a fierce geostrategic struggle unfolding in the Arab arena between Saudi Arabia and Iran. There is a real danger that all-out war in Iraq could pour more gasoline on this raging fire and destabilize fragile Arab countries.”\n\nThe ISIL fighters are exploiting simmering Sunni anger against the Shi’ite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki in Baghdad, seen by many Sunnis as a high-handed autocrat beholden to Iran.\n\nThey are also making the most of rising sectarian sentiment around the region and a weakening of government control in those Arab countries most affected by the popular uprisings since 2011.\n\nGerges said a “governance vacuum” in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon has helped al Qaeda to gain strength in recent years, risking a spillover into other countries in the region.\n\n“Al Qaeda in Iraq, Syria and even in Lebanon basically appeals to a certain segment within Sunni public opinion that feels alienated, marginalized or persecuted,” he said.\n\nLebanon, Syria’s small neighbor, has suffered a wave of bombings since last summer with the latest suicide bombing that killed at least five people in the Hezbollah stronghold of southern Beirut last week claimed by ISIL.\n\nIn a move reminiscent of the graphic al Qaeda propaganda in the most violent years of U.S. occupation, a video appeared online in August purporting to show ISIL fighter Shaker Wahib al-Fahdawi questioning three Syrian truck drivers at an Iraqi desert checkpoint and then shooting them dead.\n\nEXECUTIONS\n\nDeeming them to be Alawites, a minority to which President Bashar al-Assad belongs and that is an offshoot of Shi’ite Islam, Fahdawi strung up the bodies by the roadside in a graphic warning to non-Sunni Syrians not to venture into Iraq.\n\nIraq became a battlefield for al Qaeda after the 2003 invasion that ousted Saddam Hussein, but its numbers and the territory in which it operates have shrunk since 2006-07, when Sunni tribal chiefs joined forces with the U.S. military.\n\nAl Qaeda alienated much of the Anbar population during its period of control: Its fighters set up courts, imposing harsh punishments, including public executions, on those failing to implement its severe interpretation of Islam.\n\nBut for years the militants have been regrouping and plotting underground and slowly increasing their presence in the vast desert of Anbar, the heart of Iraq’s Sunni insurgency after the U.S.-led invasion.\n\nTension has been running especially high across Anbar since Iraqi police broke up a Sunni protest camp last week, a move that triggered clashes between Sunni armed groups and security forces.\n\nIslamist militants stormed police stations in several cities in Anbar, seizing weapon caches and freeing prisoners.\n\nIn Falluja, the masked men took control of large parts of the city. They waved al Qaeda flags, set up checkpoints and called on residents to support them through loudspeakers.\n\nIraqi troops trying to retake the cities battled al Qaeda fighters in Ramadi and shelled Falluja.\n\nISIL’s Fahdawi was pictured in social media walking through a government office where his men had taken control, although there was no independent confirmation of the date of the photo.\n\nWorking in al Qaeda’s favor has been rising Sunni resentment against Maliki’s rule: Sunnis, a minority whose political dominance came to end with the overthrow of Saddam Hussein, accuse Maliki of marginalizing them.\n\nIt is also much the best organized and disciplined Sunni force in the country, according to Iraq expert Kirk Sowell, who runs the Uticensis political risk consultancy.\n\nAl Qaeda will have to tread carefully with the tribes, whose far more numerous fighters are in every town.\n\n“So far, ISIL has essentially ridden this wave of popular Sunni anger,” said Charles Lister, visiting fellow, Brookings Doha Center.\n\nBut if ISIL wants to retain influence in Anbar’s urban centers, it needs to keep the local tribes on board.\n\nMALIKI A “BETTER OPTION”\n\nAyham Kamel, of Eurasia consultancy, said a significant portion of the Sunni community would prefer to play a role in central government politics rather than involve themselves with al Qaeda.\n\n“I do not expect confrontations in Anbar to trigger a country-wide civil war,” he said.\n\nThe authorities’ counter-strike against al Qaeda’s advance in Anbar, as well as divisions among Sunni politicians, are likely to solidify Maliki’s national authority, Iraqi analyst Hashim al-Habobi said.\n\n“Many Sunnis see Maliki as a much better option when compared to al Qaeda,” he said.\n\nDespite being allied to al Qaeda in Falluja, in Ramadi tribesmen are fighting with government security forces against the militants, and those who are reluctant to join in are doing so out of a fear of al Qaeda retaliation, tribal sources say.\n\nTribal fighters who have been deployed onto the streets, patrol in the city of Falluja, 50 km (31 miles) west of Baghdad January 5, 2014. REUTERS/Stringer\n\nMaliki urged people in Falluja on Monday to drive out the al Qaeda-linked insurgents to pre-empt a military offensive that officials said could come within days.\n\nHe will have to be careful about how he responds to U.S. help, which would be viewed with suspicion by potential Sunni allies.\n\nLister of Brookings said increased U.S. military aid would be seen by Sunnis as a proof of a perceived shift in U.S. policy towards regional Shi’ite powers since an interim nuclear deal with Iran in November.",

This is a historic moment!The President of the United States is presently under criminal investigation! When the movie comes out, this will definitely be in it. And I will definitely be played by Hugh Jackman.”\n\nCritics have complained Mueller’s team investigating Trump includes three people who have given donations to Democrats; they think he should only hire people with no political connection or, as Colbert explained, “he has to have staff of virgins.

But IHH denied this on Twitter.\n\nSuriye Azez'de vurulan TIR'lar ?HH''ya ait de?ildir. Bölgede bulunan acil yard?m ekibimiz yaln?zca söndürme çal??malar?na yard?m etmektedir. — ?HH (@ihhinsaniyardim) November 25, 2015\n\nWestern powers urged a de-escalation of tensions, but Vladimir Putin suggested he was in no mood to take Tuesday’s shooting down of a Russian fighter bomber by Turkish F-16 jets lightly.\n\nSergei Lavrov, Russia’s foreign minister, accused the Turks of a “planned provocation” that would cause Moscow to “seriously reassess” relations with Ankara.\n\n“We have no intention to go to war with Turkey,” Mr Lavrov said at a televised briefing. “Yet we can't but react to what has happened.”\n\nThe decision by Mr Putin to deploy S-400 missiles to the Russian air base in Latakia is one of several counter measures announced by Sergei Shoigu, Russia’s defence minister.\n\nWith a range of 250 miles, the S-400s would easily be able to destroy any hostile aircraft operating in the border areas of Turkey and Syria where the Russian SU-24 was shot down\n\nIts deployment also sends a message to Nato. Mr Putin’s decision to send a fleet of war-planes to the base has already turned what was previously a minor Syrian outpost to a front-line Russian base on Nato’s south-eastern edge.\n\nJust as the ease with which Turkey’s advanced American jets shot down their Russian adversary is a warning to Mr Putin not to over-reach himself, the counter-deployment of air defence missiles is intended to deter any Nato move to implement a no-fly zone over Syria.\n\nMr Shoigu also said all future bombing missions would be accompanied by fighter escorts, and ordered the country’s most powerful missile cruiser, the Moskva, to patrol in-shore waters near the Turkish-Syrian border.\n\n“She will be ready to destroy any aerial target posing a potential danger to our aircraft,” he said.\n\nPhoto: EAST2WEST NEWS\n\nThe Kremlin accused Ankara of conspiring in advance to “ambush” the SU-24 jet as it carried out a bombing mission against rebel groups near the Turkish-Syrian border on Tuesday morning.\n\nThe pilot, Lt Col Oleg Peshkov, was shot dead by rebels as he parachuted to earth. The navigator, Capt Konstanin Murakhin, survived, despite initial reports that he too had been killed.\n\nHe was rescued from behind rebel lines by a Russian-Syrian mission. Speaking publicly for the first time this evening (see video below), Capt Murakhin denied that his aircraft had entered Turkish airspace \"even for a single second.\"\n\nHe also rejected the Turkish claim that its F-16 had repeatedly warned the Russian jet before opening fire.\n\n\"There have been no warnings whatsoever,\" said Capt Murakhtin, who added that he wanted to keep flying missions from the base \"to pay them back for my commander\".\n\nIn response, the Turkish authorities released what they said was a recording of the warnings being issued.\n\nLt Col Peshkov was posthumously made a Hero of Russia, the country’s highest award. Capt Murakhtin and Alexander Pozynich, a marine killed when his search and rescue helicopter was destroyed by rebels, were awarded the Order of Courage.\n\nThe incident has provoked fury in Russia, where a mob smashed windows at the Turkish embassy on Wednesday afternoon and MPs have demanded retaliation. Police cleared the street shortly after the protest began.\n\nThe Russian authorities also appear to have threatened trade sanctions in response, and warned Russian citizens against travelling to Turkey, a major holiday destination for them.\n\nBut Mr Lavrov also hinted that Russia would resist calls from populist MPs to sever economic ties altogether.\n\nTurkey imported $25 billion worth of Russian goods and commodities last year, mostly in the form of natural gas supplies. Turkish exports to Russia are mostly made up of textiles and food.\n\nIn the wider war of words with the West, Mr Lavrov repeated suggestions that Turkey was allowing a trade in oil with Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (Isil) to continue, suggesting the shooting down of the jet was in response to Russian attacks on Isil oil installations.\n\nHowever, the United States made its own response: it announced a list of new sanctions on Syrian and Russian entities, including a Syrian Christian businessman accused of acting as a middleman buying Isil oil for the Assad regime, and Russian businessmen and companies for helping the regime.\n\nFor all of yesterday's developments click here",

  "latent_10144": "In 2013, ‘selfie’ became Oxford Dictionaries’ word of the year.\n\nIt’s become such a ubiquitous word, but few stop to think about where it came from. It may come as a surprise to learn that is has its origins in Australia: the first evidence of the word in use comes from an online forum entry by the Australian Nathan Hope, who posted a photo of his lip, which he says he cut while drinking at a mate’s 21st birthday party.\n\nIt’s not the first time an Aussie slang word has made its way into the wider English lexicon. Far from it – Australian slang has influenced the English language around the world, just as Australian culture has been transported to the world by comedians such as Barry Humphries, TV shows such as Neighbours, and actors such as Cate Blanchett and Hugh Jackman.\n\nIn the past six months, and throughout this year, Oxford Dictionaries has been steadily updating the Australian English entries to its online dictionary. By the end of this project, some 2,000 words, definitions and phrases derived from or chiefly used in Australian English will have made their way into the venerable online dictionary.\n\nOnly some of these will have made their way around the world, but just as Australians have historically borrowed many words an incorporated them into their own variety of English, other English-speakers are now borrowing from the Australian vocabulary.\n\nGreenies, mozzies and pollies\n\nTake ‘selfie’. For most Australian English speakers, the ‘-ie’ suffix is a natural part of the language. Unlike similar diminutives in international English, for example ‘birdie’ or ‘doggie’, the ‘-ie’ suffix in Australian English serves as a marker of informality – providing speakers with a shared code of familiarity and solidarity. Australian English is replete with such words: ‘barbie’ (a barbecue), ‘mushie’ (a mushroom), ‘prezzie’ (a present), and ‘sunnies’ (sunglasses) to name just a few.\n\nThere are a number of these types of abbreviations that have started their life in Australian English and are now to be found in global English: ‘budgie’ (a budgerigar), ‘greenie’ (a conservationist or environmentalist), ‘mozzie’ (a mosquito), ‘pollie’ (a politician), and ‘surfie’ (a surfer).\n\nThe Australian penchant for abbreviating words is also demonstrated by the use of the ‘-o’ suffix. In Australian English an ‘ambo’ is an ambulance officer, a ‘reffo’ is a refugee, and a ‘rello’ is a relative. A number of these types of abbreviations have made their way into global English including ‘demo’ (a demonstration), ‘muso’ (a musician), and ‘preggo’ (pregnant). Other abbreviations, including ‘perv’ (a sexual pervert) and ‘uni’ (university), have also migrated to global English.\n\nPerhaps the most well-known abbreviation in Australian English is ‘g’day’. While this abbreviated form of ‘good day’ is recorded from the 1880s, it came to international prominence in the 1980s through a series of tourism advertisements where Australian actor and comedian Paul Hogan invited people from around the world to visit Australia and say “g’day”.\n\nMany English speakers would also know about the common use in Australia of ‘mate’ (a friend, a colleague) and the great Australian adjective ‘bloody’ (used as an intensifier – ‘that’s a bloody good book’). These two words are used elsewhere but are often stereotypically associated with Australian English.\n\nBut a number of widely-used words that have either originated in Australian English, or where the first evidence and primary usage is Australian. These include ‘petrolhead’ (a car enthusiast), ‘ratbag’ (a troublemaker), ‘rustbucket’ (a dilapidated car) and ‘wheelie bin’ (a large two-wheeled bin for household rubbish).\n\nPlenty of verbs, too, have Australian origins. Examples include: ‘to crash’ (to go to sleep), ‘to hurl’ (to vomit), ‘to rubbish’ (to denigrate a person), and ‘to stonewall’ (to obstruct a piece of parliamentary business).\n\nThey’re a weird mob…\n\nAs with other varieties of English around the world, Australian English has its fair share of idioms and phrases that are often unfathomable to the non-native speaker. This is certainly true of idioms including ‘to carry on like a pork chop’ (to behave foolishly; to make a fuss), ‘to chuck a sickie’ (to take a day’s sick leave from work – with the implication that the person is not really ill), and ‘to spit the dummy’ (to lose one’s temper).\n\nBut some Australian idioms and phrases have been taken up widely in global English. For example, ‘like a rat up a drainpipe’ (very quickly), ‘no worries’ (an assurance that all is fine) and ‘to put the boot in’ (to attack savagely, especially when the opponent is disadvantaged, or in a manner which in conventionally unacceptable).\n\nAustralian comedian Barry Humphries helped to popularise a number of phrases including some of his own inventions: ‘as dry as a kookaburra’s khyber’ (very dry), and ‘to syphon the python’ and ‘to point Percy at the porcelain’ (both terms for urinating).\n\nUnlike selfie, it’s unlikely these particular phrases will catch on in a big way. But the culture that produced them has contributed many wonderful terms to the world’s vocabularies – and for that we should be ‘rapt as a dunny roll’.\n\nIf you would like to comment on this story or anything else you have seen on BBC Culture, head over to our Facebook page or message us on Twitter.",
  "latent_10187": "Carré Callaway and Wes Borland in front of their Boston Edison home in Detroit. (used with permission / credit: haydencscott\n\nDETROIT (CBS Detroit) New York, Minneapolis, Denver and Oregon were runners up on the short list of places for Carré Callaway and Wes Borland to start the next phase of their lives.\n\nThey were sold on Detroit after spending one day here.\n\nTemporarily crashing in Troy, the two were preparing for the big move on Thursday to an ornate three story home in Detroit’s Arden Park-East Boston neighborhood.\n\nTough Sell\n\nThe couple argue about how the plan came to fruition, but here’s the gist. She pitched the idea. At first Borland wasn’t receptive, but eventually he came around. “If you love me — you’ll follow me to Detroit,” he said, jokingly describing an ultimatum he perceived from Callaway.\n\n“That’s not what I said,” Callaway protested, laughing.\n\nBorland didn’t want to sleep on it. He made it clear he was against the idea from the start.\n\nThe on and off Limp Bizkit guitarist’s less-than-sterling impression of Detroit came from only seeing part of the picture. “I remember playing gigs at Harpos,” he said.\n\nCallaway convinced him to check out the houses and neighborhoods and then make a decision. “Wes immediately fell in love with it,” she said.\n\nDetroit Draw\n\nAfter growing up in Denver, and stints in L.A. and NYC — Callaway was turned off to what she described as the overdone and over populated cities and the “rat race.”\n\nFriends turned her on to Detroit for its flourishing art scene and Midwest hospitality.\n\nBorland identifies with the spirit of the city.\n\n“Everyone in Detroit is pulling together. It’s like screw everybody — we’ll make the city our own,” he said.\n\nAlso, it doesn’t hurt that he’s a thrill-ride fan. Apparently, proximity to Cedar Point was a draw. “Millennium Force is so much better than Goliath,” said Borland about his recent trip to the amusement park in Ohio, comparing its biggest coaster to a competitor at Six Flags in California.\n\nBack in the city, they plan to build a studio in the three-story 1923 vintage home. Though they couldn’t share too many details, they did reveal HGTV/DIY Network will begin shooting Thursday for an episode focused on the renovation of the rockers’ home.\n\nThey wanted a lot of space, a sense of history and excitement, which they couldn’t find elsewhere.\n\nWith so many abandoned houses, they saw an opportunity to join the revitalization of Detroit, “What’s the saying? Put your money where your mouth is,” said Callaway\n\nQueen Kwong\n\nBlazing a trail is nothing new for Carré Callaway. She is the driving force and lead singer of indie rock band Queen Kwong, which just finished a tour opening for fellow L.A. alt-rock band Failure. Callaway was discovered by Trent Reznor of Nine Inch Nails — opening for his With Teeth tour at the age of 17.\n\nWhat’s Ahead\n\nCongratulations are in order as Wes and Carré are planning to get married next summer at one of Detroit’s grandest gems, the Detroit Institute of Arts.\n\nQueen Kwong will tour next summer in the states to support their first full-length album “Get a Witness” available for pre-sale. Listen to the second single and title track off the album.\n\nCallaway said they plan to also do stand-alone shows in Detroit from time to time. Visit Queen Kwong’s official site for more information.\n\nThey’re excited to explore the local art scene and so far they’ve met local Instagram phenom Joe “Camera Jesus” Gall who is helping them line up a wedding photographer.\n\nBut they probably won’t be hanging out with another Detroit rock star resident, Kid Rock, since they’re “not friends with anyone who kills animals,” said Borland.",
  "latent_10189": "by\n\nScotland must go to its bedroom and stay there until it’s taken a good hard look at itself and is ready to join the rest of the United Kingdom without being Mr Shouty, according to Prime Minister of England, Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland, David Cameron\n\n“We’ve all had a good jolly. But it all went far too far and that’s quite enough of being Angus McShouty. You’re under our roof now and it’s our oil again. Did I mention there’s shitloads of it?\n\n“As such a referendum only happens once every three hundred years and as I’ll be dead by the time the next one comes around, I can safely say we’re not going to fulfil a single promise we made to get you to vote No. But you can always vote to leave again in 2372 or something.\n\n“In terms of extra jobs however, there will be at least one starting immediately. We need someone to drive all the money saved from the forthcoming benefit cuts in a gold truck straight out of Scotland and directly to me and my Westminster friends in one of our huge mansions. We will then use it to fill a swimming pool full of Bollinger and splash about in it scoffing canapés made from a carpaccio of rare species.”\n\nDespite his insistence that Scotland should rejoin the UK on probation with lower wages, lower benefits, earlier bed times and less oil, Mr Cameron admitted he still has a certain affection for the non independent nation. “I remember the first time I met a Scotsman. It was in a restaurant and this funny chap kept saying aye and noo instead of yes and no. Obviously we asked for him to be thrown out but I always wondered if we hadn’t, what other funny noises he might have made.” he reminisced wistfully.\n\nWhilst the SNP have described Scotland’s bedroom curfew as “scaremongering” UKIP leader Nigel Farage has hailed it as a victory for common sense.\n\n“With Salmond out of the picture it’s back to me spouting jingoistic nationalist bollocks on the telly every single waking hour.

  "latent_10317": "A report released Wednesday examining the pay practices of the 30 largest publicly held U.S. oil, gas, and coal companies concluded that pay incentives for the companies' chief executives encourages reckless behavior and is hastening a climate crisis.\n\nIn the analysis, all 13 oil exploration and production companies examined by the Institute for Policy Studies (IPS) tied executive bonuses to increasing the amount of proven carbon reserves each year.\n\n\"What we are essentially doing here is paying people massive amounts of money to continue to drill and burn and do things that are going to harm the planet and put a lot of costs on the rest of us,\" said lead author Sarah Anderson of IPS, a Washington D.C.-based think tank.\n\nFossil fuel companies current hold vast reserves of oil, gas, and coal which, if burned in their entirety would emit five times the amount of carbon than can be emitted to keep the planet from warming more than 2 degrees Celsius. The same companies also spend $600 billion a year to locate additional carbon reserves.\n\n\"These companies are already sitting on reserves that if fully burned would cause catastrophic effects, so why are we tying executive bonuses to expanding those reserves?\" Anderson said.\n\nCompensation packages for corporate executives are increasingly tied to short-term profit gains, a practice financial watchdogs criticize. For the oil and gas sector, however, the concern is amplified by the carbon dioxide emissions created from burning fossil fuels.\n\n\"When you're talking about companies with this great of an impact on our long-term health, we think it is even more necessary to take a long hard look at this and change the incentives,\" Anderson said.\n\nThe report cites the salary and stock bonuses of ExxonMobil chief executive Rex Tillerson, who made a reported $33 million in 2014. Under Tillerson, Exxon has boosted share prices by buying back its own stock, which also inflates Tillerson's equity-based pay. According to the report, 51 percent of ExxonMobil earnings per share growth from 2003-13 was a result of buybacks. Tillerson owns an estimated $166 million worth of shares.\n\nConocoPhillips also gave its CEO, Ryan Lance, an 18 percent raise to $27 million in 2014, the report says, while the company laid off 1,500 employees that year.\n\nOne group looking to change incentives for oil and gas company executives is Ceres, a non-profit sustainability advocacy organization based in Boston. In 2013, the group launched the Carbon Asset Risk Initiative to work with fossil fuel companies to address the financial risks of climate change.\n\n\"It really comes down to compensating executives for creating value for the company rather than compensating for amassing huge reserves on their books that might never be exploited or brought to market,\" said Shanna Cleveland, a senior manager at Ceres.\n\nFor the past 150 years, the best way for these companies to make more money was to sell more barrels of oil, so increasing reserves made sense. We are now, however, entering a period of transition where continued expansion of reserves isn't necessarily in a company's best interest, Cleveland said.\n\n\"You need to think about whether you've got reserves on your books that are resilient to reduced prices for a barrel of oil, lower demand scenarios, and whether or not you can generate revenues from other types of energy sources,\" Cleveland said.\n\nA 2014 study by European financial services company Kepler Cheuvreux compared potential investments by oil companies over a 20-year period. The study found that onshore wind would be competitive with oil over a 20-year period if oil sold for $25 a barrel. Offshore wind would be competitive with oil at at $50 a barrel and solar would compete at $75 a barrel. Oil is currently trading at $47 a barrel, down from $100 in July 2014.\n\nThe current report also found fault with share repurchases, a controversial practice of public companies buying back shares of their own stock. Critics say this artificially inflates a company's share price. In 2014, 23 of the top 30 fossil fuel companies spent a combined $38.5 billion repurchasing shares, a figure six times larger than the $6.6 billion all corporations spent that year on research into renewable energy, according to the report.\n\n\"The money that is disgorged through share repurchases would be much better spent doing research and development on green energy technologies,\" said Lynn Stout, a professor of corporate law at Cornell University. Forty years ago the average American public company reinvested 40 percent of its profits into its business. Today, due in part to share repurchases, reinvestment is typically less than 15 percent, Stout said.\n\n\"Can you imagine what the world would look like if the fossil fuel companies for the past 30 years had reinvested 40 percent of their profits into developing green energy technologies?\"\n\nThe IPS report also highlighted the high salaries of oil and gas company executives and pending legislation that could curb their compensation. The management teams of America's top 30 fossil fuel companies, including the five top-paid executives at each company, made nearly $6 billion over the past five years, according to the study. The figure is twice the amount the U.S. has pledged to the Green Climate Fund, which helps the planet's most vulnerable countries address the challenges of climate change.\n\nPrior studies have shown that top CEOs make 300 times more than the average employee and, the more a CEO is paid, the worse the company performs.\n\nOn August 5, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule requiring publicly traded companies to disclose the ratio of the compensation of its chief executive to the median compensation of its employees.\n\nRobin Roberts, an accounting professor at the University of Central Florida, said such efforts at increased transparency could go a long way to limiting such payments.\n\n\"Before we can get what we would like to happen we have to know what is happening,\" Roberts said.\n\nRoberts, however, said even increased transparency will fail to resolve the conflict between the desire for short-term profits from oil and gas companies and long term environmental concerns.\n\n\"They are depending on fossil fuels to drive their profit with very little regard for low carbon energy solutions,\" Roberts said. \"Those remain low priorities because those aren't where they get the most money.\"",

But many, many more people are NOT fans of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers. This 2013 Deadspin NFL team preview is for those in the latter group. Read all the 2013 NFL previews so far right here.\n\nYour team: Tampa Bay Buccaneers\n\nYour 2012 record: 7-9. The Bucs lost five of their last six games to close out the season, and they lost the final 10 games of the 2011 season. Boy, they really know how to finish up strong, don't they? Even Tony Romo thinks you people suck at finishing things. NOBODY ALLOWS LARGE OPEN GAPS BETWEEN THE WAGONS LIKE THE TAMPA BAY BUCS.\n\nYour coach: Greg Schiano. Greg Schiano could win 15 Super Bowls (don't worry, he won't actually do this) and the first thing people will still remember about him is that he's the meathead who likes bum rushing the victory formation.\n\nThe best part is that, when people shat all over on Schiano for attacking a defenseless quarterback, he got all huffy and was like DURRRR WELL 'ROUND HERE WE DON'T GIVE UP JUST BECAUSE WE LOST DURRRR. He's actually proud of his idiot strategizing, as if other teams are pussies for NOT doing this. He's the perfect moron coach—the kind of coach who thinks he can magically solve all of a team's problems by JACKIN' UP THE 'TUDE. I bet he has a sign up in the locker room that says PRIDE and nothing else. Never say die! Swarm to the ball! Hit someone in the mouth! MASTER YOUR ASS. Greg Schiano is the kind of sap who thinks that's a novel way of approaching his profession. I look forward to one of his players shitting in his car trunk.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nYour quarterback: Josh Freeman. Russell Wilson is everything Josh Freeman should be but is not: polished, accurate, DREAMY. You should never be happy when people think your quarterback will improve strictly because he's in a contract year. NFL quarterbacks need to be just a bit more consistent than that. Freeman experienced a massive dip in his completion percentage last fall AND he turned the ball over 19 times. He threw NINE picks in his final three games. JESUS. But he didn't shoot himself last year, so at least he's got that part of his game in check.\n\nYour one fantasy player everyone will hate: Peyton Hillis, who will steal four touchdowns away from Doug Martin this year for absolutely no reason at all. I can see it coming, clear as day: Hillis will run for 3.2 yards per carry, fumble 87 times, and yet still manage to get spot goal-line duty, single-handedly devaluing a top-three fantasy back who easily could have scored those touchdowns himself. Why is Hillis even IN the league anymore? Why would you give this asshole a job? Goddamn Bucs.\n\nWhy your team sucks: When I first got married, my in-laws got themselves a new dog. My wife and I loved that dog. We played with it and napped with it and scratched its belly. IT WAS A GOOD DOGGIE! Then we had kids and never paid attention to the poor dog again. In fact, whenever the dog is around now, we're like Hey! This dog's in the way of our precious children!\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Tampa Bay Bucs are that dog. They are the neglected pet that the Glazer family kicks out of the way so that they can dote on their beloved Manchester United. At least Jerry Jones cares enough about his team to run it into the ground. The Bucs could fall into a giant sinkhole (FLORIDA!) and the Glazers would hardly notice. They know they barely have to lift a finger for the Bucs to rake in impossible profits, so they cut costs on things like competent coaching and front-office management while watching the money pour into their coffers. If they need to blindly spend on the occasional free agent to make it LOOK as if they care, then fine. And if they happen to win along the way, goody. If not, MONEY. The Glazers are so utterly indifferent to the Bucs that they care more about whatever team happens to be playing in London—be it a real team or an imaginary future London-based franchise—than the NFL team they actually own. Like their fans, the Bucs have been left on their own to get fat, develop a severe case of ringworm, and die in agony.\n\nWe make fun of the Jaguars all the time for having a tiny, nonexistent fanbase, but the fact is that the Jags sell 10,000 more tickets per game than the Bucs do. And the Bucs won a fucking Super Bowl! It's not just the fact that this is the worst team in the NFC South; it's that everyone involved seems content to let them stay that way. Oh, but Greg Schiano has a brilliant plan to leg whip the opposing team's punter in Week 1. REFUSE TO LOSE, GUYS.\n\nBy the way, I've been to the Tampa area. It's nothing but strip malls and lizards. You could die in Tampa and no one would notice. It's where life goes to evaporate.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhy your team doesn't suck: Hey, it's Darrelle Revis! He's pretty good, provided that he stays healthy and the Bucs don't trade him to Patriots at midseason for nothing at all!\n\nThe 12 worst Bucs ever:\n\n1. Eric Curry. Did you know he's still alive? I totally thought he wasn't alive anymore.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n2. Jacquez Green/Riedel Anthony/Ike Hilliard. Why didn't they sign Chris Doering to complete the shitheap?\n\n5. Gaines Adams.\n\n6. Keith McCants\n\n7. Vinny Testaverde\n\n8. Alvin Harper. To this day, Alvin Harper remains the poster child for Free Agent Wideouts Who Benefited From Playing With A Good QB And Went Somewhere New To Suck. If only the Dolphins had thought of Alvin before signing Mike Wallace.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n9. Trent Dilfer\n\n10. Steve Spurrier\n\n11. Jerramy Stevens\n\n12. Mike Alstott. Oh god, nothing would engorge Chris Berman like watching big dumb Mike Alstott bogart a touchdown from Warrick Dunn, thereby allowing Boomer to make bashing sound effects and scream out that stupid fucking nickname. Fuck Mike Alstott.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEmails from Bucs fans:\n\nJustin:\n\nImagine rooting for a team that's just good enough to never get excited about. Another 6-10 or 8-8 season? I can't even get the masochistic satisfaction of being truly awful. Vincent Jackson and Doug Martin well get your fantasy team meaningful stats, but it won't matter because the Saints or Falcons will already be up by 18. The high point for the franchise was a Super Bowl win that whenever it gets mentioned by anyone (it doesn't), it's usually to note that Bill Callahan wasn't changing the audibles that Jon Gruden knew than anything the Bucs accomplished on the field.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShannon:\n\nEvery fucking decision the Glazers make is about money. The Glazers have been the lowest spenders in the league 7 different times since 2002. During The Great Recession the Glazers couldn’t even afford the shitty team they had in 2008, so they fired Gruden and Bruce Allen, cut every solid veteran on the team, and by 2010 the Bucs had 10 starters who were either drafted in 2010 or signed off the street in 2010. During one point of the “Raheem Morris Era”, a rival NFC South Scout said the only starting caliber NFL players we had on our entire roster were: Davin Joseph, Donald Penn, and Adrian Clayborn. The Bucs gave away home field advantage in London in both 2009 and 2011 because Wembley Stadium was a more profitable place to play a Bucs game than Raymond James Stadium (our fans suck too). When it became apparent, in 2011, that Raheem Morris was the worst coach in the NFL by far they fired him. It could have been because his slogan, “Youngry” (a word he made up) translated into “we’re a bunch of guys signed of the street for league minimum who are literally hungry.”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyle:\n\nI wasn't born a Bucs fan, because nobody is. But people like me choose to follow this team because we: A. Live in Florida; B. Like the team because OH WOW BUCCANEERS WE'RE LIKE THE RAIDERS BUT FAMILY-FRIENDLY NOW PASS THE FRIED MAYO STICK; or C. That's about it. This team is terrible in the worst kind of way. We're not \"we deserve to be good by now\" bad like the Browns, not \"why haven't we moved yet\" bad like the Jaguars, and not \"we're on the upswing, oh wait, nope\" bad like the Lions. The Bucs are just irrelevant bad. They'll open the season at 5-3, winning against equally terrible teams like the Carolina and Kansas City, then once any sort of national attention is cast on a player that's not shitting his pants all season (Doug Martin, Josh Freeman, LeGarrette Blount), the team loses 6 straight and nobody cares again. Fortunately we can finally rid ourselves of Freeman this year after he throws another 20 interceptions in the last three games of the season.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCharlie:\n\nJosh Freeman will always be good enough to prevent you from going 2-14 and drafting a stud, but bad enough keep you from winning a Super Bowl. We will weasel our way into a wild card this year and he will be heralded as a franchise quarterback (despite the fact that he sucks), and signed to a four-year extension, every year of which we can expect extreme mediocrity, and no more trips to the playoffs due to some bloated contract Dominik throws his way. It's unbelievable to see all the talented players Schiano has cut or traded over the past two years because of \"character issues\". Kellen Winslow got cut even though he was our best TE in franchise history, now we have Luke Nobody Stocker as our starting TE. Last year we traded our best cover corner, Aqib Talib, for a fourth round pick. We promptly went on to have the worst pass defense in the league. And we have released Eric Wright, our second best CB, and brought in Peyton Hillis. The only thing that makes the games bearable is the unbelievable MILF density inside RayJay Stadium and the prospect of feeding Mike Glennon giraffe food. Seriously, Google Mike Glennon's neck.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEdog:\n\nBack in the 90's when the Bucs were just brutal, I used to go to a Ticketmaster by my house the night before the game and pick up tickets to a game, usually in the end zone, 4 or 5 rows up. They ran about 28 bucks. Our fucking fan base is the worst. We suck again, and now every game is a blackout. I feel like we are definitely going 6-10, after starting 4-2. Fuck.\n\nCole:\n\nThey fired two of the best coaches the NFL has seen in Dungy and Gruden. And they haven't had a draft pick pan out since fucking Ronde Barber in '97. I'm not kidding, look at this list of scrubs. At least when they wore creamsicle unis, everyone expected them to be bad.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKyle:\n\nI root for the Bucs. Yes, we've upgraded our secondary with Revis and Gholston. Yes, our running game and wide receivers are a vast improvement from a few years ago. But we're still fucked because we are in the hardest division in the league. Brees/Matty Ice/Cam?? Fuck me, man.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCraig:\n\nThis team can't figure out what its identity is. At least under Gruden we knew we would see a geriatric QB, a west coast offense, and the Tampa 2. Sometimes that worked, sometimes it didn't. Then they canned him, and team was going to build through the draft around a solid core of young players. Free Agents? Don't need 'em. Then that became a flaming shitwreck, and so no more of this young energetic crap! Go get an ornery white coach and spend spend spend! We now have a WR getting top-10 money, a left tackle getting top-10 money, two (!) guards getting top-10 money, a DT getting top-5 money, a safety getting top-5 money, the top paid CB, a punter getting top-5 money, and a (injured) kicker who is getting $2.3 million. Jesus! I'm sure those contracts won't bite the team in the ass down the road. Already this year, the team known for managing it's salary cap so prudently (by spending no money for three years) had to rework the contracts of last year's free agents. Five percent of this year's salary cap is tied up between the punter and kicker, or it would have been if that kicker didn't tear his Achilles playing basketball this summer. The team has lowered ticket prices to as low as $30, and will knock another $10 off if you've bought a Pizza Hut pizza recently, and yet probably still won't sell out all their games.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGabe:\n\nTampa is basically a convalescent home with strip clubs. The marquee player on our roster, Gerald McCoy, has spent 2/3 of his NFL seasons on IR. Highest-Paid-Guard-in-NFL Carl Nicks made it three games as a Buc before IR. Davin Joseph? First pre-season game last season. Adrian Clayborn made it two games before joining them. Connor Barth got a $13+ million deal as a kicker and tore his Achilles playing basketball this month. This is the crack medical team that's going to get Revis's knee in game shape? They might as well have had Tonya Harding waiting for him as he got off the plane. Also, Greg Schiano looks like he hits his kids.\n\nWanna be part of the Deadspin NFL previews? It's simple. Just email me and give me ample evidence of why your team sucks: personal anecdotes, encounters with fans, etc. I'll throw any good material into the post and give you proper credit. Next team up: Carolina Panthers.",

  "latent_10433": "In a grim statistic that surprises no one close to the problem, Ohio leads the nation in opioid overdose deaths, a new report shows.\n\nAlong with the overall category, Ohio also had the country's most deaths related to heroin: One in 9 heroin deaths across the U.S. happened in Ohio.\n\nThe Buckeye State also recorded the most deaths from synthetic opioids: About 1 in 14 U.S. deaths.\n\nIn all the categories, Ohio easily surpassed states with larger populations.\n\nAccording to state-by-state statistics compiled by the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, 2,106 opioid overdoses were reported in Ohio in 2014, which was 7.4 percent of the 28,647 deaths reported nationwide that year. California ranked second with 2,024 deaths and New York was third with 1,739.\n\nThe statistics are troubling but probably aren't news to many law enforcement officials, treatment providers and families of addicts in Ohio who have seen the number of overdose deaths shoot up every year lately.\n\nOhio's status as the nation's OD capital may continue. The state's overdose deaths rocketed to 3,050 last year and are expected to burst past that number in 2016.\n\nThe Kaiser analysis, compiled from U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention information, showed Ohio had the highest number of deaths from synthetic opioids, such as fentanyl and carfentanil, with 590 deaths out of 5,544 nationally, or 7.4 percent.\n\nFinally, Ohio also had the dubious distinction of having the most heroin deaths in 2014, 1,208 of 10,574 nationally, or 11.4 percent, the Kaiser statistics showed.\n\nNational statistics showed one area where Ohio fared slightly better than other states: overdose deaths from drugs such as oxycodone and hydrocodone, which are typically dispensed in pill form. Ohio has made great strides in recent years in reducing the number of narcotic pain pills prescribed in the state, only to see addicts move to harder drugs such as heroin and fentanyl.\n\nIn response to the overdose numbers, Melanie Amato, spokeswoman for the Ohio Health Department, said the state is “committed to an aggressive and comprehensive approach to combating opiate overdoses. We have seen 81 million fewer opioid doses dispensed to Ohio patients since the state took initiatives to curb abuse. We are continuing to crack down on drug trafficking, preventing youth drug use before it starts, encouraging appropriate use and availability of pain medications, saving lives by expanding availability of naloxone, and creating pathways to addiction treatment and recovery.”\n\nIn a related issue, Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine announced that Adapt Pharma has frozen its public interest price for naloxone nasal spray at $75 for two 4-milligram doses for Ohio through the next year, making Ohio the only state to negotiate a price freeze.\n\nNaloxone can limit or stop the effects of an opioid overdose.\n\nThe price freeze benefits Ohio law enforcement, first responders, state and local government agencies, and community-based organizations, DeWine's office announced. The cost is a 40 percent discount from Adapt Pharma's wholesale acquisition cost of $125.\n\nOhio also receives a rebate from Amphastar Pharmaceuticals of $6 for each syringe purchased through March of 2017.\n\n“The cost to purchase naloxone has prevented some agencies from carrying this life-saving drug, but I hope that Adapt Pharma's new price freeze for Ohio will allow more agencies to consider keeping naloxone on hand,” DeWine said. “I continue to urge law enforcement agencies to carry this drug because it can mean the difference between life and death for those suffering from addiction.\"\n\nThe statistics state-by-state are available online in a sortable database at http://kaiserf.am/2gBhNht.\n\nccandisky@dispatch.com\n\n@ccandisky\n\najohnson@dispatch.com\n\n@ohioaj",

  "latent_10484": "Animal Kingdom pleased his connections in a workout over the straight course but not before giving them a brief scare by jumping a path after the winning post. The Dubai World Cup winner, who also has a Kentucky Derby to his name, was having a dress rehearsal for the Queen Anne Stakes on day one of Royal Ascot next month, which is expected to be his final race before being retired to stud.\n\n\"He just saw the line across the wire and tried to jump,\" said his rider, Johnny Velazquez, who had flown in from the US the day before for the sole purpose of working Animal Kingdom. A stylish and hugely experienced jockey, Velazquez did well to stay aboard when his mount unexpectedly took to the air as they passed the point where horses emerge on to the track from under the grandstand.\n\n\"You've got to expect something, it's a new track. He's seen something that's not supposed to be there, obviously, it's going the opposite way to the grass. He tried to jump and he was going fairly fast to do that.\n\n\"I was lucky to stay on him but other than that he did everything very well. I saw him seeing something, he did give me the sign before he was going to do it, so I was kind of prepared.\"\n\nVelazquez was sure that Animal Kingdom had not been spooked by a small group of people against the rail at the point where he jumped, which would have been a worrying sign with the busy Royal crowd in mind. \"If it would have been the people he would have gone the other way [towards the middle of the track],\" Velazquez said.\n\n\"He actually looked at the people before that, I thought that's what he saw first and then he looked again … I just didn't think he was going to do it because he looked at it and I kind of, 'Hah!', yelling at him, but he jumped right on top of it. It was a very awkward moment but thankfully nothing happened.\"\n\nThe jockey hopes Animal Kingdom will do no such thing at any point of the Queen Anne itself but after a short discussion between him and the horse's trainer, Graham Motion, the two men agreed the horse might wear a noseband, which they called a \"shadow roll\", on top of his usual blinkers.\n\nMotion did not see the incident, as he accompanied Animal Kingdom and his galloping companion to the start of the work, riding a pony. He then hacked up Ascot's straight a long way behind the two thoroughbreds.\n\n\"Johnny told me about it,\" said Motion. \"He just ducked from a shadow, I believe. I'm not too concerned about it. It's probably a good dress rehearsal.\n\n\"We might put a little shadow roll on him. It'd be a shame if he did that on raceday. I'm glad I didn't see it.\"\n\nExplaining the reason for the exercise, Motion said: \"It's not something I would normally have done but the fact that they [Ascot's management] were going to let us do it. I just thought it was really important for the horse. What we're doing with this horse is so foreign to anything he's ever done before that I think, every stone we can turn, it really helps and I think this was a big part of it.\n\n\"I'm very satisfied with how it went and Johnny seems really pleased with him. I'm really pleased that he handled the soft grass. For us, it was very soft out there today, softer than I thought it was.\n\n\"Johnny felt he handled it great. I didn't think it would be a problem, he's a horse who seems to handle everything that's thrown at him. He's bred to handle soft grass.\"",
  "latent_10587": "June 23, 1999\n\nJ. D. Salinger's Love Letters Sold to Entrepreneur Who Says He Will Return Them\n\nBy DINITIA SMITH\n\nEW YORK -- The saga of the hermitic author, the confessional writer, the love letters and the auction block came full circle Tuesday and ended, at least in theory, happily for everyone.\n\nFourteen letters written 27 years ago by J. D. Salinger to Joyce Maynard, a young writer and star-struck admirer who lived with him briefly when she was a young woman, were sold at Sotheby's for $156,500 to the software entrepreneur and art collector, Peter Norton. Norton then announced that he was going to return them to Salinger.\n\nThe sale would seem to wrap up a story that has fascinated the literary world with a Shakespearean denouement. Salinger, a famous recluse who has sued in the past to keep his words private, presumably will be content to have the letters back. Ms. Maynard, who said she needed to sell them to raise tuition for her children, now has enough for four years at an Ivy League college, before taxes.\n\nAnd Norton is pleased to be of service.\n\n\"A lot of people I admire,\" he said in a telephone interview, \"share the opinion that if the letters have to be sold they should fall into sympathetic hands.\"\n\n\"My intention is to do whatever he (Salinger) indicates to me he wants done with them,\" he continued. \"He may want them returned. He may want me to destroy them. He may not care at all.\"\n\nA man who answered the phone at the office of Phyllis Westerberg, Salinger's agent, said that neither she nor the author would have any comment about the sale.\n\nMs. Maynard, in a telephone interview on Monday, said she felt little emotion about finally parting with Salinger's letters. \"I don't shed a tear. The sale of the letters really was a business decision,\" she said. \"I'm really finished with it. I feel a burden lifting for me.\"\n\nNorton, the retired head of Peter Norton Computing Inc. and a contemporary art collector, said he does not know the 80-year-old author of \"Catcher in the Rye\" and other works, and has not been in touch with him. But he indicated he respected his quest for privacy.\n\nSince Salinger last published in 1965, he has vigorously guarded his seclusion and he has not been heard from during what in gentler times would have been called a literary scandal. Ms. Maynard, who published a memoir last year that included an account of her nine-month romance with Salinger, has been roundly taken to task for her decision to sell the letters.\n\nSome accused her of violating Salinger's privacy, and trading on his name. The National Review termed her an \"opportunistic onetime nymphet.\"\n\nBut Norton defended her decision to sell the letters. \"This woman also had a right, really a duty to herself and her children to safeguard her economic security.\"\n\nMs. Maynard, 45, is the divorced mother of three children.\n\nNorton said the sale was fraught with \"moral ambiguity.\"\n\n\"I thought, gee, it's a shame this is happening and I thought if it's happening, it would be for the best if the letters ended up in the hands of the sympathetic party,\" he said. \"I had the means to be a contender.\"\n\nNorton did not attend the auction but placed an \"order bid\" with Sotheby's beforehand, setting an upper limit to the amount he would pay. Pre-sale estimates for the letters ran between $60,000 and $80,000. The final price includes a commission to Sotheby's, so Ms. Maynard will receive about $140,000.\n\nThe auction, which was held at Sotheby's New York headquarters, had an air of anti-climax about it, with the room only half filled. Marsha Malinowski, a vice president in the department of books and manuscripts and the expert in charge of the sale, said there were at least four bidders, including Norton. The opening bid was $50,000. Bruce Gimelson, a book dealer bidding on behalf of a private collector, stopped bidding at $130,000.\n\nNorton, 55, made his fortune as the inventor of a set of computer programs called Norton Utilities. One of them, UnErase, can recover deleted computer files. Norton sold his software business to Symantec in 1990 and runs his foundation from Santa Monica, Calif.\n\nThe sale represents an ending of sorts, to a story that began in 1972, when Ms. Maynard, then a student at Yale, wrote an article, \"An 18-Year-Old Looks Back on Her Life,\" in The New York Times Magazine, published with a photograph of its doe-eyed author. Salinger, then 53, wrote the 18-year-old a fan letter, \"in strictest privacy, if you can bear it,\" offering her fatherly advice, and warning her not to let herself be exploited for her talent.\n\nThe letters continued with Salinger praising her writing abilities, and saying they were soulmates. He told her how much he craved isolation from the world, and expressed disillusionment with his relatives and the publishing industry.\n\nEventually, the tone became one of a lover. Ms. Maynard left Yale, and moved in with him at his home in Cornish, N.H. But the relationship was troubled. After less than a year, Salinger broke it up. On Aug. 17, 1973, he wrote Ms. Maynard one last letter in a cold tone.\n\nFor 25 years, Ms. Maynard kept silent about their connection, until her memoir \"At Home in the World,\" (Picador USA). She said that one reason she wrote the book was to put the past to rest. She also said, in a statement written on the eve of the auction, that she was motivated to make public the couple's intimacy by her discovery that Salinger had carried on similar correspondences with other young women.\n\nMs. Maynard had originally planned to attend the auction, but at the last minute, changed her mind when she realized that much of the attention would be focused on her. \"This will sound naive,\" she said, \"but it didn't occur to me that anyone would watch me.\" She said she had hoped that people \"would look at the letters themselves, instead of focusing the attention on my violation.\"\n\nBecause of copyright restrictions, the letters were only on view at Sotheby's from July 17 to July 21 in a private room under guard. They could be seen only by people judged by Sotheby's to be prospective buyers.\n\nSalinger had turned to legal action in the past to prevent letters or significant portions of them from being published. Under copyright law, letters are the property of the owner, but the content belongs to the writer. In 1987, Salinger successfully stopped the author Ian Hamilton from quoting from his copyrighted letters in a biography of him.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, a letter written by John Adams three days before the signing of the Declaration of Independence sold for a record price of $635,000. In the letter, Adams warned that freedom from England would be won \"at great expence of blood.\"",

(Photo: Tribune photo/Phil Drake)Buy Photo\n\nHELENA – Members of the Indian community on Friday urged lawmakers to support a plan to combat Native American suicides and also said that a Medicaid expansion plan passed in 2015 has helped bring them much-needed health services.\n\nThe House Health and Human Services subcommittee held a work session regarding the 98-page Montana Native Youth Suicide Reduction Strategic Plan as it reviews the state’s appropriations act. The plan, released this month, includes statistics on suicides, an action plan, a survey and resources.\n\n“When I look at the statistics I don’t see the numbers,” said Erin Irvine, who served as one of 30 people on the coalition that worked on the report and is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Reservation. “I see the cousin who slit his throat. They aren’t numbers, they are faces.\n\n“I feel so hopeful with this plan,” she said and then asked lawmakers to support it.\n\nMontana has been at or near the top of the nation for the rate of suicides for nearly 40 years. For the past 10 years, the Treasure State has had a suicide rate of 22.33 per 100,000 compared to 12.22 per 100,000 for the rest of the country, according to a DPHHS report.\n\nThe highest rate was among American Indians (35.5 per 100,000) followed by whites (28.1 per 100,000).\n\nAccording to the coalition’s report, the rate of suicide of Native American youth 15-24 is 3 1/2 times higher than non-Native youth.\n\nIn 2015, the 64thstate Legislature, at the request of Gov. Steve Bullock, appropriated $250,000 to have the Department of Public Health and Human Services oversee the project.\n\nJon Ebelt, public information officer said there is $123,000 from those funds left to spend. He said in the governor’s budget there is a proposal to invest $1 million in new funds to help address the youth suicide epidemic in Montana. He said this $1 million proposal is separate from the DPHHS budget.\n\nThe plan has four strategic pillars: launch a statewide Zero Suicide Initiative, support local community healing, empower Native youth and reinforce frontline offenders.\n\nLoren Bird Rattler of the Blackfeet Tribe said Friday this is an issue that crosses lines in Montana.\n\n“This is a plan you can measure,” he said.\n\nJace Killsback, president of the Northern Cheyenne Tribe, said Kauffman and Associates Inc., which worked on the plan with the coalition, had provided a guide.\n\n“Funding gets us one step closer to handling or own health disparities,” he said. “We look to all parties to help us take care of the ‘first’ Montanans.”\n\nMuch of the discussion turned to Medicaid expansion which was approved by the state Legislature in 2015 as part of the Affordable Care Act.\n\nLynn Cliff Jr. of the Fort Belknap Tribe told the panel that Medicaid cuts would hurt the community.\n\n“I encourage you to look at the people out there,” he said.\n\nDaryl Wright II of the Chippewa Cree Tribe told the panel that the Legislature gave “the gift of hope” last year when they passed Medicaid expansion.\n\n“Substance abuse is expensive to treat but more expensive not to treat,” he said.\n\nHe asked members to the support the strategic plan.\n\n“We are losing too many of our youth to suicide,” he said.\n\nRep. Nancy Ballance, R-Hamilton, a member of the House panel, said she wants to see how the report fits in with the other pieces of suicide prevention legislation that are out there.\n\n“There’s a lot of time to figure it out,” she said.\n\nThe plan comes as the state is considering other suicide prevention bills. House Bills 117 and 118 would each be allocated $500,000.\n\nHB 117 will provide grants to local agencies to provide funding for grants for local efforts to prevent veteran suicides in Montana. HB 118 will be used for statewide, multimedia suicide prevention campaign for all ages, ethnic groups and occupations.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://gftrib.com/2jIrI61",
  "latent_10659": "Abstract Background The estimated number of new HIV infections in the United States reflects the leading edge of the epidemic. Previously, CDC estimated HIV incidence in the United States in 2006 as 56,300 (95% CI: 48,200–64,500). We updated the 2006 estimate and calculated incidence for 2007–2009 using improved methodology. Methodology We estimated incidence using incidence surveillance data from 16 states and 2 cities and a modification of our previously described stratified extrapolation method based on a sample survey approach with multiple imputation, stratification, and extrapolation to account for missing data and heterogeneity of HIV testing behavior among population groups. Principal Findings Estimated HIV incidence among persons aged 13 years and older was 48,600 (95% CI: 42,400–54,700) in 2006, 56,000 (95% CI: 49,100–62,900) in 2007, 47,800 (95% CI: 41,800–53,800) in 2008 and 48,100 (95% CI: 42,200–54,000) in 2009. From 2006 to 2009 incidence did not change significantly overall or among specific race/ethnicity or risk groups. However, there was a 21% (95% CI:1.9%–39.8%; p = 0.017) increase in incidence for people aged 13–29 years, driven by a 34% (95% CI: 8.4%–60.4%) increase in young men who have sex with men (MSM). There was a 48% increase among young black/African American MSM (12.3%–83.0%; p<0.001). Among people aged 13–29, only MSM experienced significant increases in incidence, and among 13–29 year-old MSM, incidence increased significantly among young, black/African American MSM. In 2009, MSM accounted for 61% of new infections, heterosexual contact 27%, injection drug use (IDU) 9%, and MSM/IDU 3%. Conclusions/Significance Overall, HIV incidence in the United States was relatively stable 2006–2009; however, among young MSM, particularly black/African American MSM, incidence increased. HIV continues to be a major public health burden, disproportionately affecting several populations in the United States, especially MSM and racial and ethnic minorities. Expanded, improved, and targeted prevention is necessary to reduce HIV incidence.\n\nCitation: Prejean J, Song R, Hernandez A, Ziebell R, Green T, Walker F, et al.

The data are de-duplicated at CDC both within and across states, and the reported case counts are adjusted for reporting delay to estimate the number of new diagnoses of HIV infection and AIDS, annually [1]. These estimates have been used to track the HIV epidemic in the United States, but because HIV diagnosis can occur at any point during the long latency between infection and symptom development in HIV disease the estimates have been limited by their reliance on HIV testing and reporting practices. In response to these limitations, CDC, in conjunction with a number of state and local health departments, implemented national HIV incidence surveillance, using a serologic marker of recent HIV infection to classify new diagnoses of HIV infection as either recent or long-standing [2]. Additional data on history of HIV testing and antiretroviral use are collected to determine sampling weights for estimation of the number of new HIV infections in the United States, both diagnosed and undiagnosed [3]. Based on data from HIV incidence surveillance, Hall and colleagues developed the first national HIV incidence estimate based on a direct measure of recency of infection [4]. It was estimated that in 2006 approximately 56,300 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 48,200–64,500) individuals were infected with HIV. HIV surveillance is a dynamic system with additional data continually reported to state surveillance systems, and estimates of HIV diagnoses and incidence are updated to reflect these newly available data, science, and programmatic considerations. For example, the incidence estimation model is sensitive to sudden changes in HIV testing patterns which could influence estimates of HIV incidence [4] if recommendations for routine HIV testing [5] are fully implemented. In addition, the continued refinement of the method for estimating the mean recency period for the BED HIV-1 Capture Enzyme Immunoassay (BED; the assay that currently serves as the serologic marker of recent infection) [6] and for modeling the recency period distribution [7] has allowed for improvement of the method of modeling HIV incidence [3]. We updated the earlier estimate of HIV incidence for 2006 based on additional data and methodological refinements, and extended the previous results with estimates for the years 2007, 2008, and 2009.\n\nMethods Since 1982, all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia have reported AIDS cases to CDC. In 1994, CDC began receiving reports of diagnosed HIV infection from the 25 states with confidential name-based HIV reporting. As of 2008, all 50 states, the District of Columbia and 5 territories submit de-identified data on reported diagnoses of HIV infection to CDC. Since 2004, CDC has funded selected states and localities to conduct HIV incidence surveillance by (1) submitting remnant diagnostic HIV-positive blood specimens for testing using the serologic testing algorithm for recent HIV seroconversion (STARHS) [8] and (2) collecting supplemental data on history of HIV testing and antiretroviral use. STARHS is a two test algorithm in which the first test is used to determine whether an individual is HIV-positive on a standard enzyme-linked immunoassay (EIA) test. Currently within STARHS the EIA is followed by the BED which measures the concentration of anti-HIV IgG to total IgG in a sample. The result is reported as a standard optical density (SOD), a continuous measure that describes the relative concentration of anti-HIV IgG. If the SOD for a given sample is over a threshold predetermined to define a “long-standing” infection then the infection is deemed no longer recent. The period of time during which the SOD is below this threshold is termed the recency period, denoted by W. Its associated survival function, Pr(W>t) is denoted by S W (t). HIV incidence surveillance was designed to take advantage of national HIV surveillance by incorporating needed information on history of HIV testing and antiretroviral use and STARHS result data into routine case reporting in the states and cities that receive funding to conduct HIV incidence surveillance. From 2004 through 2007, 34 surveillance areas, including 27 state/territorial health departments and 7 city/county health departments, participated in HIV incidence surveillance. Since 2008, HIV incidence surveillance areas have included 25 health departments, including 18 state, and 7 city/county health departments. HIV incidence surveillance areas collect information on the self-reported date of first HIV antibody positive test, date of most recent HIV antibody negative test, number of negative HIV tests in the two years before testing positive, and antiretroviral usage (including beginning and ending dates, if applicable). In addition, HIV incidence surveillance coordinators in these areas collaborate with public and commercial laboratories to locate and ship remnant diagnostic blood specimens for testing using STARHS at a single national laboratory [2]. The BED has been used with STARHS in the United States since 2005 to classify new diagnoses of HIV infection as either recent or long-standing. Despite the relative advantage of using the existing HIV surveillance system and its resources to implement HIV incidence surveillance, health departments face logistical challenges in securing remnant HIV-positive blood specimens from multiple laboratories for use in STARHS. As a result of these challenges, remnant diagnostic blood specimens are frequently unavailable for STARHS. Although the percentage of cases reported to national HIV surveillance with a STARHS result has increased annually in all HIV incidence surveillance areas, in order to examine the temporal trend in incidence from 2006 through 2009, only those areas that met certain minimum criteria—15% completeness of STARHS results (as in previous analyses), confidential name-based reporting of HIV cases, and continuous implementation of HIV incidence surveillance throughout the entire analysis period—were included in this analysis. Those surveillance areas included 16 states (Alabama, Arizona, Colorado, Connecticut, Florida, Indiana, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia, and Washington) and 2 cities (Chicago and Philadelphia). While the minimum inclusion criterion was 15% completeness of STARHS results, the lowest level of completeness for any area was 17% in 2006, 20% in 2007, 27% in 2008 and 22% in 2009. We included in the analysis new diagnoses of HIV infection (regardless of the stage of disease) among individuals aged 13 years and older at diagnosis in the years 2006 through 2009, with a residence at diagnosis in one of the aforementioned areas, and reported to CDC through June 2010. Data on STARHS results and history of HIV testing and antiretroviral use included data reported to CDC through January 2011 for these cases. We estimated HIV incidence using the stratified extrapolation method described by Karon and colleagues [3], which is based on concepts borrowed from sample survey methodology. The total number of diagnosed and undiagnosed HIV infections in a single year is estimated based on the observed number of new HIV diagnoses classified as recent infections using STARHS and the estimated probability that a new HIV infection would be diagnosed within the STARHS recency period (and thus classified as a recent infection). Based on additional available data, we modified two major components of the previously published method: (1) the method for estimating the probability of being detected in the STARHS recency period, and (2) the method for addressing missing information on transmission category. Previously, the probability of being detected in the STARHS recency period (P) was simply calculated as the product of two probabilities: (1) that of being tested within one year after infection (P 1 ), and (2) that of an infection being classified recent using STARHS, given a test within one year after infection (P w ). The previous method was simple because the second probability could be approximated by the mean STARHS recency period. However, this simple estimate is subject to bias in two instances: (1) when the time of HIV testing within one year after infection is not uniformly distributed in that one-year interval, or (2) when the probability of an individual having a STARHS recency period longer than one year is not close to zero. The first assumption is violated in population groups with frequent HIV testing and leads to an artificial upper limit on the calculated probability of being detected in the STARHS recency period equal to P w because P 1 cannot be greater than 1. With the additional data available subsequent to the initial 2006 HIV incidence estimate, the extent of these biases became clear, as both the impact of testing frequency, and the probability of an individual having a STARHS recency period longer than one year (currently estimated to be 0.049 using the BED) were greater than anticipated in this population. To eliminate these biases we now calculate P directly from the testing frequency distribution observed in the population. For repeat testers (i.e., those individuals with a previous negative HIV test), P is calculated based on the distribution of T, the time from the last negative test to the first positive test. Under the assumption that the infection date is uniformly distributed in the interval [0,T], we have: where S W (t) is the probability that someone infected with HIV t years ago would have remained ‘recent’ on the BED assay since acquiring HIV (i.e., the STARHS recency period survival function), n is the number of repeat testers (people testing positive after a previous negative test), and T i is the time T from the ith repeat tester. We used a nonparametric step function to estimate S W (t), with a mean of 162 days, based on recently-updated estimates of the recency period distribution [7]. Table S1 displays the probability of having an HIV test within the BED recency period (P) for a given number of months between the last negative HIV test and the first positive test (T). The average group level probability (P) for each of 68 homogeneous demographic groups of repeat testers was used in the estimation of incidence for repeat testers. For new testers (i.e., those whose first HIV test was positive), the average group-level probability, P, is estimated based on the HIV testing rate which is in turn estimated from a competing risk model (time to AIDS diagnosis vs. time to HIV test) and the probability of AIDS at HIV diagnosis (progression to AIDS before a HIV test). Let X be the time from HIV infection to the first HIV positive test. Based on Karon et al [3], X has an exponential distribution with a scale parameter , where q is the probability of AIDS at HIV diagnosis within the group. Let W be the recency period length, A the time from HIV infection to AIDS diagnosis (the AIDS incubation period), and assume that W and A are independent. Then, the expected group-level probability (P) is: where S A (t) is the survival function for the AIDS incubation period (from HIV infection to AIDS diagnosis) without treatment represented by a gamma distribution with a shape parameter α A = 2 and a scale parameter β A = 4. Table S2 displays the probability of having an HIV test within the BED recency period (P) that is assigned to each new tester in a group based on the group's proportion of cases diagnosed with AIDS at the time of the HIV diagnosis (q). The other major improvement in the estimation procedure is the approach to handling missing transmission category. Previously, cases with missing transmission category were separated from those with known transmission category in the imputation and incidence estimation procedures. The estimated incidence in this group was then redistributed to other risk groups consistent with methods previously used to address missing risk factor information in national HIV surveillance data. [9]. Since the 2006 estimate, a more accurate, multiple imputation method for assigning mode of transmission based on observed data, rather than historical trends have been developed and applied to the national surveillance system [10]. We have applied those same methods in the revised incidence estimation model, imputing missing transmission category values. The imputed transmission category values were then used in imputing STARHS results and testing history information and in the subsequent estimation procedures, thus eliminating the additional step of redistributing the incidence within the missing transmission category group to other transmission category groups. Following the previous model, incidence estimates were adjusted to account for those newly diagnosed but not yet reported HIV cases. Finally, the estimated incidence within the areas contributing data for estimation was extrapolated to the remaining U.S. areas to obtain a national estimate by applying the group-specific ratio of HIV incidence to diagnoses of AIDS within the areas contributing data to the number of new diagnoses of AIDS in the remaining U.S. areas. Population denominators for the calculation of rates were based on intercensal estimates for 2006—2009 obtained from the United States Census Bureau [11]. Annual differences in HIV incidence overall and within groups were determined using the z-test. To eliminate the correlation between annual incidence estimates, the uncertainty associated with the STARHS recency period distribution estimate (a common factor within each year's incidence estimate) was removed from the calculation of the z-score. We also calculated the estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) in the estimated number of new HIV infections by fitting a logistic regression model to the natural logarithm of the incidence estimate using calendar year as the regressor [12].\n\nDiscussion Based on the revised stratified extrapolation approach for estimating HIV incidence, the number of new infections in the United States remained relatively stable between 2006 and 2009. Our analysis examines HIV incidence over a four-year period to provide the clearest picture of the current status of trends in incidence. The only population with a change in HIV incidence over the entire four-year period was 13–29 year olds, and within that age group, the only risk group experiencing increases was MSM. Among young MSM the estimated number of new infections increased significantly from 2006–2009; the increase in incidence in this group was largely driven by a statistically significant increase in new HIV infections of 48% (12.2% annually) in young, black/African American MSM. The point estimate of the number of new HIV infections in 2006 presented here is somewhat lower than the previous estimate but within the confidence interval of that estimate [4]. The difference is attributed to additional years of data including removal of duplicate case reports between states, and several improvements in the method, including calculating the probability of testing within the STARHS recency period using the observed testing frequency rather than the mean recency period which allowed us to mitigate the impact of artificially limiting the probability for repeat testers who test frequently. Additionally, using newly available information on the length and distribution of the STARHS recency period would be expected to decrease the estimate by approximately 4% even if no other revisions to the model had been made because the updated mean recency period is 4% higher than the mean recency period used for the previous estimate. Finally, uncertainty related to reporting delay adjustment may impact estimates. As additional years' data become available we expect that the HIV incidence estimates presented here will be revised further, consistent with estimates based on surveillance data which are subject to reporting delay. Because of anticipated adjustments to these estimates over time, it is important to focus primarily on the overall population impact and trends, rather than the precise point estimates, when drawing conclusions from these analyses. Consistent with the higher rates of HIV diagnoses among MSM in general [13], and of both HIV diagnoses and HIV incidence in African American and Hispanic/Latino men and women [14]–[15], the 2006–2009 HIV incidence estimates continue to demonstrate the disproportionate impact of HIV disease in these groups. Although the results did not demonstrate a significant increase in HIV incidence among MSM overall, they indicate an increase among young people aged 13–29 that is largely driven by increases in incidence among young MSM, particularly young black/African American MSM. The increase in HIV incidence in young MSM is in line with the increase seen in new diagnoses in MSM in recent years in the United States [16] and internationally [17] as well as with increases in HIV incidence seen in the United States using an extended back-calculation model [4] and with international trends in incidence in MSM [18]–[19]. These estimates are subject to several limitations. First, in order to maintain consistency across the analysis years, we limited our analysis to only those states that consistently met the inclusion criteria for all analysis years. Therefore, the estimates are based on data from 16 states and 2 cities. The included areas represented 61% of reported cases of AIDS in the United States for the years 2006 and 2009, 62% for the years 2007 and 2008. Because data were only available for a limited number of surveillance areas, we extrapolated our HIV incidence estimates from the included areas to the rest of the United States by applying the ratio of HIV incidence to AIDS incidence in the included areas to the AIDS incidence in the rest of the United States. To evaluate the validity of this extrapolation we compared the ratio of HIV diagnoses (as a proxy for incidence) to AIDS diagnoses in the included areas to that ratio in the areas to which we extrapolated. By extrapolating from the same surveillance areas each year, we may have underestimated HIV incidence overall by approximately 4%; using different areas each year, we may have underestimated HIV incidence by about 3%. Additionally, while the represented areas included several jurisdictions with very high morbidity, others—including the District of Columbia and the state of California—were not included in the estimate. Because HIV incidence in an area is driven by both risk behavior and HIV prevalence, the HIV incidence estimate may have been higher if these areas had been included. However, our method of extrapolating to the United States as a whole using the same 68 strata used for estimation likely compensates for the lack of inclusion of some cities with high HIV morbidity. It also limits overestimation of HIV incidence due to the differing ratio of HIV diagnoses to AIDS diagnoses in the incidence versus non-incidence areas. Next, an assumption of the model is that HIV testing behavior has not changed over several years [4]. Comparing by year, the percentage of persons diagnosed with HIV and AIDS concurrently (within the same month), the percentage of persons classified as repeat testers, and among the repeat testers, the average time since last negative HIV test, the data indicate that HIV testing behavior remained stable over the analysis period. As a result of the apparent stability in these indicators of HIV testing behavior we did not adjust the model to account for a change in HIV testing behavior. CDC has recently funded HIV testing initiatives to reach individuals whose behavior puts them at high risk for HIV transmission and, in 2006, published recommendations for routine, opt-out testing for all individuals 13–64 seeking medical care [5]. While there are no data to indicate the level of uptake of the recommendations, evidence suggests that implementation of opt-out testing does increase HIV testing [20]. The data on history of HIV testing and antiretroviral use collected through HIV incidence surveillance may not have been collected over a long enough period of time to reflect recent changes in HIV testing behavior. If HIV testing has increased recently we may have overestimated HIV incidence in recent years. CDC will continue to track these indicators of testing behavior and adjust the estimation model as needed to reflect any changes detected in future years. Additionally, concerns about using the BED assay within STARHS for cross-sectional estimation of HIV incidence have been raised for some HIV subtypes due to the misclassification of long-standing infections as recent [21], however, these issues are less relevant in the United States because of the predominance of HIV subtype B and as a result of the integration of STARHS results and supplemental data on history of HIV testing and antiretroviral use into national HIV surveillance [22]. This integration ensures that cases diagnosed with AIDS, at or within 6 months of HIV diagnosis, can be correctly classified as long-standing irrespective of STARHS result and allows for the removal and subsequent imputation of STARHS classification for cases in which antiretroviral use occurred prior to diagnosis. However, some HIV infections that were diagnosed late in the course of HIV disease, but not close to the time of AIDS diagnosis could have been misclassified as recent infections, adding to the uncertainty in calculation of HIV incidence and in comparison of HIV incidence across years. In our previous work we noted that the HIV incidence estimate for 2006 could have been an overestimate if we had underestimated the likelihood of testing for HIV within one year of infection. The revised model for incidence estimation presented here addresses this concern by using the entire distribution of the STARHS recency period which limits the impact on the weights assigned to repeat testers who test more frequently than once per year, thus limiting the amount of overestimation bias inherent in the previous model. It is still possible, however that we could have overestimated incidence if a significant number of individuals were motivated to be tested for HIV by a real or perceived recent exposure, as this motivation was not addressed in the estimation model. We previously estimated that we may have overestimated HIV incidence by as much as 7% as a result of excluding motivation from the model to calculate incidence [4]. Finally, a number of additional assumptions of the model have been previously described [3]. These assumptions include that HIV incidence has been stable in recent years, that the likelihood of HIV testing prior to a diagnosis of AIDS is constant both with respect to time and to duration of HIV infection, that all HIV infections will eventually be diagnosed (either through testing or through death), and that individuals accurately report the HIV testing and treatment information, especially the date of their last negative HIV test. In addition, an assumption of using multiple imputation for missing data on BED result and HIV testing group (repeat or new testers) is that these data are missing at random, though not necessarily missing completely at random. These assumptions were addressed in the previous description of the model, and their effects were determined to be minimal, or to counterbalance one another. The estimates for 2006–2009 continue to underscore the disproportionate toll that the HIV epidemic has taken on several populations in the United States including racial/ethnic and sexual minorities and injection drug users with 95% of new infections 2006–2009 estimated to have occurred in individuals in one or more of these groups. Though transmission rates have decreased substantially since the beginning of the epidemic [23], public health programs are presented with new challenges. There is a need to address the prevention needs both of people at risk for HIV infection as well as of those living with HIV disease—those who are aware of their HIV status and those who are not. With an estimated 21% of people living with HIV unaware of their HIV status [24], and the majority of new HIV infections transmitted by these individuals [25], it is important to expand testing to those people most at risk and provide them with care and prevention services. Adequate funding and services should be directed to individuals at greatest risk for acquiring and transmitting HIV infection, if we are to make a further impact on the HIV epidemic in the United States.\n\nSupporting Information Table S1.

  "latent_10708": "What I love about the Mass Effect series is that feeling of being in command of my own starship. Wandering the decks of the Normandy, talking to the crew as I decide what exciting space adventure to have next, I’ve never felt more like Kirk or Picard. But while this sense of ownership and freedom is present in all three games, it’s only the original Mass Effect that makes me feel like I’m really exploring space. The Mako has a bad reputation, but I’ve always had a soft spot for it. When I land on those alien worlds, bouncing around on the surface, I feel like I’m exploring an uncharted cosmos, rather than just triggering missions on the galaxy map\n\nOK, so most of the planets are barren and rocky, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t anything to see. Some of the vistas are beautiful, their burning blue suns, ancient pyramids, mystical monoliths, and horizon-dwarfing moons all reminding you that you are very far from home. The universe could be a lot more detailed and vibrant, but it’s an enjoyable aside to the main story. You don’t have to explore all these planets to finish the game, but there are some interesting rewards for doing so.\n\nMy favourite secret is on Eletania in the Attican Beta cluster. If you have the trinket from the Asari Consort mission, you’ll be able to activate an alien ruin on the surface of the planet. This gives Shepard a vision in which he’s a primitive human on Earth thousands of years ago, being observed by a strange creature made of ‘shining silver’ that ‘flies without wings’. The implication here is that the Protheans were studying humans long before we developed space travel. They could never have guessed that an ancestor of one of those cavemen would, thousands of generations later, become a key player in the destruction of the Reapers and avenge the Prothean extinction.\n\nOn the planet Ontarom in the Kepler Verge you find a herd of four-legged, two-armed alien cows, one of which the game labels as ‘shifty looking cow.’ Turn your back on it and you’ll notice you start losing credits. You can kill it, but it’ll respawn and you won’t get your credits back. It’s this kind of incident that makes space exploration fun for me, even if they are few and far between. For every neat Easter egg there are ten caves filled with Geth, slavers or other space-jerks.\n\nAnother memorable moment is flying to the Moon and seeing the Earth looming over you. In the Mass Effect universe a trip to the Moon is probably like taking a bus two stops down the road, but for us it’s a distance we can understand, which hammers home the point that, wow, I’m in space. Just don’t look at the sprite for too long or you’ll realise that it’s the wrong way around. Some Mass Effect novel probably retcons this, saying that the Earth was flipped with magical space-lasers to stop the reversal of the Gulf Stream or something. Hey, why am I not writing these spin-off books? That’s gold.\n\nOn the planet Ontarom in the Kepler Verge you find a herd of four-legged, two-armed alien cows.\n\nPlaying Mass Effect again, I realise how much more control I have compared to the sequels. When I finished it the first time and moved on to Mass Effect 2, I missed being able to manage my inventory and mod my armour. The newer games are definitely slicker to play, but the RPG elements were either sidelined or heavily simplified. Combat is dramatically worse in the original, but I never felt like I could customise Shepard or his party to the same satisfying degree again. Being able to mix and match armour upgrades depending on the type of enemy you’re about to face is really handy. For example, installing the shock absorber mod to stop those pesky biotics from knocking you on your arse.\n\nAlthough the original game is still fun, some things haven’t aged that well. Those slow, boring elevator rides between areas are as deeply tedious as they were before, but I did enjoy the way BioWare poked fun at it in Mass Effect 2: “Ever miss those talks we had on the elevator?” asks Garrus. “No,” replies Tali, curtly. Brilliant.\n\nIt’s not as handsome as Mass Effect 3, but I still love the way it looks. The cinematic noise filter gives the visuals grit and texture. This is not the gleaming, perfect future we’re used to seeing in games. It’s understated, stylish and lived-in, taking its cues from classic ’60s and ’70s science fiction films such as 2001, Alien, Silent Running and Solaris. It does a great job of drawing you into its mythology, and it’s one of the few games that I’m totally invested in—yeah, even after the ending of Mass Effect 3. I liked that before they caved in to angry internet pressure and released the Wayne’s World-style ‘mega happy ending’ as DLC.\n\nIn each game the interior of the Normandy has a different feel. In the original, which is my favourite of the three, it’s much darker and more atmospheric than Cerberus’s orange-tinged refit, and the less said about Mass Effect 3’s messy corridors the better. But the layout is always vaguely the same, and the ship has become one of my favourite videogame places. The fact that it’s my ship only makes it more special. Seeing it destroyed by the Collectors at the beginning of the second game was a sad moment, and cleverly made veterans of the original even more determined to exact revenge upon the insectoid cads.\n\nMass Effect is regarded by most as an RPG, but I think of it more like a totally competent third-person shooter saved by being attached to a brilliantly dramatic space opera. I really care about these characters, and this bond only gets stronger as I repeatedly save the galaxy alongside them in the next two games. It’s not quite a masterpiece of storytelling, but it is confidently written, well acted, and set in a rich, fleshed-out universe. A new game is already in the works at BioWare Montreal, and I’m not sure what direction they’ll take it in, but the first game still holds up on PC if you feel like reliving the trilogy.",

  "latent_10899": "Welcome to Trolling for Dummies. I’m glad that you can join us as we explore the thrilling world of trolling. Trolling is safe, easy, and provide hours of entertainment with little to no effort. All it takes is minimal knowledge of the subject matter, a sense of your audience and planting the right “seed.” Today we’re going to focus on (pardon the pun) trolling photography forums.\n\nPhotography forums are great because they meet the basic requirements of good trolling subjects. One, many of them are very active, some with hundreds of posts a day. Two, they are filled with passionate participants. Think about it, instead of going out and taking photos or processing and printing them, they are spending hour upon hour talking about cameras. And three, their passion for cameras leads to strongly held beliefs that are ripe for trolling!\n\nOne thing you’ll note–many of you are not photographers, so we won’t go into any real detail about the subjects we’ll discuss today. That’s ok though, as an aspiring troll you will need to learn just a little bit about each subject that you troll. Remember, ignorance is power! Now let’s look at popular trolling topics on camera forums:\n\nEquivalence\n\nOne of the classics. Watch people that barely made it through high school math battle it out with physicists and real life rocket scientists. Watch people fight sensor size wars solely on equivalence.\n\nThe beauty of this troll is that it will work in just about any camera forum. Large sensor forums will say that small sensors are crap because of equivalence, and small sensor forums will say that their new F0.4 lens is awesome. Or that their back hurts. The only place this troll won’t work is with Sony forums because they make all the sensors for others and their own cameras have just about every sensor size imaginable. But they’ve likely sold more sensors than lenses, so you can try that.\n\nPentax is Doomed\n\nPentax owners are a curious lot. Many have been loyal to the brand from back in the day when Pentax stood at the top of the heap of camera manufacturers, when mustaches weren’t ironic. But since then the luster and market share have faded and Pentax sits a distant third among DSLR camera makers. Tiny market share plus one new corporate master after another makes Pentaxicans skittish about their future. Heck, some are stomping mad at their new corporate overlords.\n\nMerely questioning Pentax’s future prospects is enough to bring the skeptics, optimists, and lunatics* out from the woodwork. On a good day, a simple, “I’m interested in buying a Pentax but am not confident that they will exist next month.” will start the fireworks. Another option is to point out Pentax’s longstanding lack of a full-frame camera as an Achilles heel. Get some popcorn and enjoy!\n\nDSLRs are Dead\n\nIn the minds of some photographers, DSLRs may as well be steampunk cameras, with copper tubing and Victorian Age aesthetics–all that’s missing is a spark arcing across a Jacob’s Ladder and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Mirrorless is the new emperor, they say, with its smallerness, it’s EVFity, and it’s kind-of-like-an-iPhone-ness.\n\nBut you’ve got to use this troll carefully; it’s very context sensitive. On a Canon or Nikon forum you should suggest that mirrorless cameras are going to outsell their beloved DSLRs by the end of the year. On a mirrorless camera forum you should boast that your $700 DSLR is better than their $1400 fetish. Either one should be enough to spark the flames.\n\nMicro Four-Thirds is Doomed\n\nThe Micro Four-Thirds format is the Napoleon Bonaparte of the camera world. Yes, they’ve got plans to take over the world, but they are very sensitive to others noting their small sensor and small market share. Pointing either of these out while suggesting that this deficit will lead to the format’s demise will draw out a small army of defendants. Bonus points if you can throw in Olympus’ bookkeeping shenanigans or Panasonic’s lack of camera cred.\n\nVideo is Killing Real Cameras\n\nIn the beginning, adding video to a still camera was akin to adding a clock to a microwave oven–there was no real purpose, but since there was a clock on the microchip, the product folks said, “What the hey, why not?” But video on DSLRs and Mirrorless cameras are evolving at a feverish pace. And it’s no wonder, as some makers see video as a key differentiator and a possible lifeboat for when the SS Point-And-Shoot finally hits that iceberg.\n\nBut all this attention to video is hurting the feels of some traditionalist as each successive generation of camera feels more like a camcorder and less like a Canon AE-1/Nikon FM2/Pentax LX/etc…Nikon, sensing this frustration, has even gone so far as to introduce a camera without any video features at all.\n\nFor this troll to work well, you’ve got to get your timing down. Don’t just throw it out there into the wind and expect it to stick. Wait for a new camera with interesting video features and find a forum with a mix of still photographers and videographers**. Get it wrong and the troll won’t last long–everyone will either agree or disagree with you. Get it right and you’ve the war of generations on your hands!\n\nLeicas are Worth It\n\nNothing gets the forums buzzing quite like the announcement of a new Leica, with 99% saying, “Ha ha, for the same price I can get a truckfull of gear from {insert favorite brand here}. The remaining 1% shake their heads, gather on RangeFinderForum.com and say, “Those plebians just don’t understand.” Some venture into the low places (DPReview.com, et. al.) to do battle with the unwashed masses. It rarely ends well.\n\nWhen a new Leica is released, there are several ways to play this troll. One, go to a Leica-oriented forum and claim that the new camera is overpriced. Two, go to a non-Leica forum and claim that you are selling all your gear to get the new Leica and a single lens.\n\nI’m Leaving Nikon for Canon\n\nNothing gets stuck in a Nikonian’s craw more than watching one of their own leave for “that other brand.” Nikon and Canon have been battling for camera supremacy for years, so any defection to the other team is high treason. You can really wind Nikonians up if you claim that you are leaving for a dubious reason, I.e., claim that Canon has an advantage where it doesn’t. For example, “Farewell all, it’s been a lot of fun here, but I’m selling all of my Nikon gear and investing in Canon. I just feel that Canon has better zoom lenses and better sensors.” That will really wind them up!\n\nI’m Leaving Canon for Nikon\n\nThis one is even better than the “I’m leaving Nikon for Canon” simply because of the fact that there are more Canonistas than Nikonians. Find a big, juice Canon forum and bombs away!\n\nAs with all trolling, it sucks to get called out early. Some forums have volunteer troll-watching units that will look for obvious marks of a troll. Don’t register for a forum and troll with your first message. Put in a little time, feign some interest, and then set your bait. Good luck, and we look forward to hearing about your trolling at our next monthly meeting where we will talk about HiFi and Watch Trolling.\n\n* And by “lunatic” we mean those Pentaxicans that attach mega telephotos to their little Qs to take photos of the moon.\n\n** Perhaps the ugliest word in existence.\n\nFollow NCN on the Facebooks, Twitters, and that other thing for the latest camera news.",

  "latent_11702": "A pistol-packing Texas pastor on a mission to discover who has been stealing packages from front porches of homes in his town finally found his suspect — a middle-age grandmother, 52.\n\nPastor Benny Holmes was “at his wit’s end” to find out who had been stealing his home deliveries over the past few weeks, his wife Pat said, to KTRK.\n\n“He was determined in his mind that he would sit here [on his porch], however long it took, to see if he could find her,” Mrs. Holmes said, Fox News reported.\n\nHe finally caught her in action and jumped into action. When police responded to the scene, they saw Mr. Holmes, armed with his gun, holding Laurie Ferguson captive, Fox News said. Police then found Ms. Ferguson to be in possession of several reported stolen items from several Baytown homeowners — including a pastor’s robe that had been delivered to the Holmes’ house back in June.\n\nShe’s been charged with theft, police said, the New York Daily News reported.\n\nBaytown, a small community in Chambers County in the heart of the Gulf Coast region, recently made national news headlines because of firefighters who went above and beyond their duties to to help out a grieving family of an Air Force veteran who died of a heart attack. After responding to the scene to help the heart attack victim, firefighters returned to the home to finish the grass he was mowing when he went into cardiac arrest.\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

  "latent_11708": "HealthNewsReview.org requested two months ago that the University of Maryland release public documents pertaining to a troubled study about chocolate milk and concussions — a request that the university is bound by law to fulfill within 30 days. While the university drags its feet, Andrew Holtz has been trying to find out more from Washington County (Maryland) Public Schools, whose student football players supposedly participated in the study. As he reports separately today, he learned that the school district’s account of events is vastly different from what a university news release suggests happened in the study. Below, Earle Holland comments on the university’s attempts to run out the clock on their PR problems, and explains why that strategy is unlikely to work.\n\nThe University of Maryland’s efforts at controlling a debacle involving its research have been doomed from the start.\n\nFirst, they sent out a news release claiming that a brand of chocolate milk had restorative powers for high school athletes with concussions, even though the so-called “study” had not been published, peer-reviewed or even completed.\n\nThen the university decided to stonewall all questions about the study, one that apparently used children from a local public school system — although that school system now denies that any of its students participated in such a study. Senior administrators and the lead researcher all clammed up. After several weeks, the University announced it was conducting its own inquiry and then went silent again on details.\n\nMaryland’s outdated PR playbook\n\nAsk most public relations experts about their advice in such crisis situations and they’ll quickly tell you to get out in front of the story – tell it all and tell it quickly. Anything else just amplifies suspicions that there’s worse to come. Maryland apparently skipped that lesson.\n\nIn an effort to gain answers to essential questions about the research, the Baltimore Business Journal (BBJ) – whose coverage of this story has been excellent – and HealthNewsReview.org both sent public records requests to the University as allowed under Maryland’s Public Information Act.\n\nThe documents requested included the project’s Institutional Review Board protocol which would outline research protections for the subjects; the main researcher’s annual conflict-of-interest form (required by the University), and any contract between UMd and the local school system allowing its students’ participation in the study.\n\nUnder the state’s Public Information Act, agencies must acknowledge receipt of such requests and provide an estimate of when it will be fulfilled, as well as information on any costs involved. If delays are necessary, then the organization has to provide a specific legal reasoning for the delay.\n\nVague excuses in response to BBJ\n\nFrustrated by refusal to deliver the requested documents and after several attempts at learning the status of the newspaper’s request, BBJ finally heard from the university’s chief communications officer last week.\n\nIt reported that according to Crystal Brown, “The University will be providing the requested documents as soon as practicable. The committee’s report regarding this matter, which is also expected to be provided, is still being finalized. The review of both the requested documents and the final report need to be completed before public release to insure that legal obligations owed to parties referenced therein are met.”\n\nA subsequent letter from the University’s deputy general counsel stated that Maryland’s communications with the newspaper “represent good faith compliance by the University with its legal obligations under the Act.”\n\nNot hardly. Vague references to “legal obligations” don’t constitute a legitimate reason for withholding these documents, and it’s difficult to imagine any substantive concern as to why the release of these public documents — available with a few clicks of a computer mouse — should be delayed. Instead, it appears that the delay is part of a misguided public relations effort to put the best possible spin on the affair. The university hopes to release its report first, which, in theory, would help them to frame the narrative in a positive light and keep carping reporters on the sidelines.\n\nA strategy that could backfire\n\nBut that’s a misreading of the situation. With as many eyes as there are on this fiasco, and as badly as it’s been managed thus far, it’s foolish to think that such games will influence the reporting to the university’s advantage — and in fact the opposite is more likely to be true as reporters become more frustrated and suspicious of the university’s motives.\n\nIn addition, as a public institution, the university has an obligation to work in the larger public interest, and that interest is not served by damage control efforts that delay and stymie the release of public information. The people of Maryland deserve to know, in a timely manner, the extent to which their public university has followed the appropriate rules that govern these kinds of research projects.\n\nAnd what of HealthNewsReview.org’s public records request, one sent on January 31st of this year? We were informed our request “will take thirty days from the date your request was filed.”\n\nFifty-nine days have passed and we’ve received no word yet.",
  "latent_11754": "I’m not going to cross my legs like ladies do,” Fabio Panceiro told the New York Times last week, “I’m going to sit how I want to sit.”\n\nHe’s not alone in his sentiments about New York’s Metropolitan Transit Authority’s (MTA) new campaign to discourage “manspreading,” the practice of male passengers, essentially, feeling the need to open their legs as widely as possible while riding public transportation.\n\nFrom the story which you can read here:\n\nIn addition to being generally impolite, some women feel that the posture is not just a subtly aggressive statement of male privilege, but often also a potentially threatening one. By manspreading, a male passenger is not only insisting his right to take up as much space as he desires in public, regardless of the needs or desires of others, but can also use his physicality as a means of intimidation.\n\nManspreading, some argue, is a form of passive assault .\n\nI'd never heard of manspreading until today and I live in a house full of men.

  "latent_12025": "The problems faced by international oil and gas companies started long before the price collapse | Spencer Platt/Getty Images Oil majors warned to revamp business model or face collapse Without change, oil sector’s future could be ‘nasty, brutish and short.’\n\nThe world’s biggest publicly traded oil and gas companies face “rapid collapse” unless they adapt their business models to a world that uses less fossil fuels, according to a Chatham House report published Thursday.\n\nTwo of the headline reasons for looming trouble are falling oil prices and new climate change policies, but the core problem is that the energy companies' business and investment strategies are deeply flawed, the report found.\n\nThe steady decline in oil prices since mid-2014, from more than $100 per barrel to around $45 now, and the COP21 Paris climate agreement reached in December have both added pressure to drastically cut carbon dioxide emissions and curb global warming. And that means weaning the world off coal, oil and gas.\n\n“You have a situation where the COP21 is more or less publicly saying that we have a large amount of hydrocarbons that we can’t burn if we want to stay at 2 degrees Celsius or less,” said Paul Stevens, the report’s author and a distinguished fellow in the London think tank’s energy, environment and resources department. “It’s the ultimate writing on the wall.”\n\nBut the troubles faced by international oil and gas companies started long before the oil price collapse and the Paris deal, he found. They date back to the 1990s, when the industry adopted a financial model that under-priced the risk of big long-term projects, such as deepwater oil and gas or Canadian tar sands.\n\nCrude prices of around $100 largely \"disguised\" the underlying problem, he said, and the subsequent price fall has now exposed those weaknesses. The urgency of shifting gear is not lost on the companies. “They are aware of the fact that the business model needs to change if they have any hope of surviving.”\n\nOil prices are expected to bounce back in the coming years, but not to their old peaks. The International Energy Agency expects them to reach around $80 per barrel by 2020, as the current slowdown in production causes supply to tighten.\n\nRethinking models\n\nA separate report published on Thursday by the London-based financial think tank Carbon Tracker Initiative found that as long as oil prices remain low, the world’s seven largest oil majors would be better off proceeding only with lower-cost projects instead of traditional big-ticket long-term investments that don't take climate change into account.\n\nIt found that upstream assets owned by the seven companies — ExxonMobil, Shell, BP, Chevron, ConocoPhillips, Eni and Total — would be worth a combined $140 billion more if their investments are aimed at keeping global warming at 2 degrees.\n\nThe oil price drop has already caused financial turmoil for the seven majors, forcing them to cancel or delay investments and sell off assets to make up for huge losses.\n\nIn the last two weeks, the U.K.’s BP reported a loss of $583 million the first quarter of 2016, following a $3.3 billion loss in the previous quarter. France’s Total announced its net income for the quarter had dropped by 37 percent, to $1.6 billion, compared to the same period last year. And Shell posted an 83 percent drop in current cost of supplies earnings, to $814 million in the first quarter, compared to the same time last year.\n\nCompanies are responding to the pressure.\n\nTotal, for instance, announced the creation of a new gas, renewables and power unit last month, which will focus on expanding the company's downstream gas, renewable energy and energy efficiency business.\n\n“Electricity will be the energy of the 21st century and the growth of gas and renewables is driving us to fully capture margins across the entire electricity value chain,” Patrick Pouyanné, Total’s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. The company aims to become one of the top three solar power players, to expand its electricity trading and storage business, and to become a leader in biofuels, especially for jets — all in the next 20 years, he added.\n\nRisky business\n\nThis marks a change from the typical international oil company business model of the past 25 years. That was based on three pillars, according to Stevens: maximizing shareholder value by setting benchmarks for financial returns; maximizing estimated oil and gas reserves; and minimizing costs, partly through outsourcing.\n\nThe list of problems with this model is long and diverse, Stevens said.\n\nThe rise of resource nationalism in recent years has kept the majors from tapping the easiest and cheapest-to-reach reserves, as governments have taken greater ownership of their own resources and favored their own local and state-owned companies.\n\nMajors also made the mistake of outsourcing the provision of technologies to services providers in order to cut costs, giving international contractors like Schlumberger and Saipem the room to muscle in and expand their technology businesses.\n\nOptions for overhauling the oil and gas industry's business model include squeezing costs in the hope that oil prices will rebound; reshuffling portfolios, mainly away from unprofitable downstream businesses such as refining; or building in-house technology, he said in the report.\n\nBut the only “realistic” option for the companies is to restructure and shrink their work to operations that can still generate “acceptable” returns.\n\n“If they can, then the [international oil companies] will be able to slip into a gentle decline but ultimately survive, albeit on a much smaller scale,” he said.

  "latent_12457": "New York state has announced plans for the most far-reaching paid family leave law in America, as well as promising to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\n\nThe state will mandate the right to 12 weeks of paid leave for both private sector workers asking for time off to care for a new baby and workers who need to look after a sick child or partner, a dying parent or other such family emergency.\n\nThe system is designed to be paid for with insurance-style funds made up of fees deducted from pay packets, rather than costing companies directly.\n\nAfter long and largely unsuccessful battles to improve notoriously stingy maternity leave rights across the country, the New York law will introduce an extensive and egalitarian model which advocates hope will now influence other states and federal lawmakers.\n\nGrowing momentum to expand paid leave is fantastic news for Americans Read more\n\nNew York’s governor, Andrew Cuomo, announced late on Thursday that the state legislature had agreed the new policy on paid family leave. In addition, he promised to increase the state minimum wage, in phases, from $9 to $15 an hour over two to six years.\n\nEmployees’ rights advocates are calling the wage boost a “revolution in the workplace”.\n\n“I believe this is the best plan the state has produced in decades,” Cuomo said after long hours of negotiations in Albany brought agreement on the next annual budget, which includes the new measures.\n\nThe right to three months of paid family leave a year will be offered to mothers and fathers adopting or fostering as well as having their own biological children. It will be mandated for men and women needing to nurse a sick partner, spouse, parent or other family member.\n\nNew York is only the fifth state in the US to adopt a paid family leave law. California implemented such a law in 2004, but it only offers six weeks of paid leave, as do provisions passed in New Jersey in 2009 and Rhode Island in 2014. Washington state adopted a similar measure in 2007 but has yet to put it into practice.\n\nFederal family and medical leave laws passed in 1993 under Bill Clinton’s administration only guaranteed 12 weeks of unpaid leave and job protection, and excluded companies with fewer than 50 employees.\n\nNew York’s new law will guarantee pay and applies to small businesses as well as large companies. It covers the private sector; public sector unions can opt in.\n\n“This is the most robust paid family leave program in the US, it’s tremendous and will be a revolution in the workplace and for economic justice,” said Donna Dolan, executive director of the Time to Care New York Paid Leave Coalition, a campaign group with corporate and union members that has been battling for better leave rights for more than 15 years.\n\nDolan pointed out that America is still far behind the rest of the developed world; countries such as the UK offer 40 weeks of paid maternity leave. But she called New York’s plan a “pacesetter”.\n\nMassachusetts, Connecticut and Washington DC are close to passing new paid family leave laws, she said.\n\nDolan said Democratic presidential candidates Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders have declared strong support for mandatory paid family leave, while the Republican candidates left in the race, Donald Trump, Ted Cruz and John Kasich, have not publicly addressed the issue.\n\n“It’s just not on their radar screen,” she said.\n\nNew York senator Kirsten Gillibrand has co-sponsored a bill mandating national paid family leave, but, Dolan said, it has no chance of passing a Congress paralyzed by partisan legislative gridlock and controlled by Republicans.\n\nMandated paid family leave in New York state will begin in 2018 with employees being docked approximately 70 cents a week from their pay. The money will be paid into a family leave insurance fund, and the program will be phased in over three to four years.\n\nAccording to the New York state department of labor, workers paid at or below the state average weekly wage, which in 2014 was $1,266.44, will receive two-thirds of their average pay while on family leave. The program will be capped at the state average, so higher-paid workers will lose out.\n\n“This program will be funded entirely through a nominal payroll deduction on employees, so it costs business, both big and small, nothing,” Cuomo said.\n\nThe Business Council of New York State, which represents thousands of companies and chambers of commerce, is opposed to the plan as well the $15 minimum wage.\n\n“We are disappointed with the multibillion-dollar increase in the minimum wage … [and] further discouraged that the budget deal includes the most expansive paid family leave law in the nation while leaving out meaningful business cost reductions,” said Heather Briccetti, chief executive of the business council, in a statement.\n\nBut Laura Ornstein, coordinator of the New York State Sustainable Business Council, said the new law will help employers, by boosting morale, productivity and loyalty of workers.\n\n“Debating whether you want to stay home and lose out on pay, or maybe even lose your job, is awful,” she said. “If you go into work you are worried, you are distracted. We are very excited by this new law.”\n\nShe added that the wide reach of the law, beyond maternity leave, had probably made it more popular and relevant, therefore winning it easier passage through the legislature.\n\nCuomo talked about deeply regretting not spending more time with his dying father in 2014. His wife recently had surgery for breast cancer.\n\nUpstate, Jan Rhodes Norman, a small business owner and co-founder of the Local First Ithaca business association, said she would have preferred the state to have announced more tax cuts for businesses in tandem with the new laws. Overall, she supported the paid family leave plan.\n\n“America is so behind other developed countries in not having this sort of safety net and we need to be moving in that direction,” she said.",
  "latent_12465": "Towards the end of last season, Continuum started rolling out lots of crazy plot twists — Carlos joins the Freelancers! Travis and Sonia die! — only to undo them when Alec went back in time. After last night's frenetic episode, I'm wondering if we're in store for the same trick a second time. Spoilers ahead...\n\nLast night's \"The Dying Minutes\" was a lot of fun, except that stuff happened at blinding speed and I kept having to double check that I hadn't missed an episode or two. This whole season has been like that — this timeline's Alec turned into a suit-wearing douchebag so quickly, it felt like we missed some crucial scenes, for example. And now, Brad and Kiera are \"family\" after a few episodes together. Most of all, Kiera has apparently accepted that she can never return to her family in 2077, but we never got to see her process that crushing disappointment.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe penultimate episode of the season featured some huge reveals, and also killed off a ton of major characters. I had to rewatch it a second time to understand all of the cryptic hints, but it was sure fun to watch the first time. Favorite scene: When Kiera, Brad and Hoodie Alec are in the car and Hoodie Alec realizes that none of them is from this timeline. This show is still tossing around some weighty issues, but it's also ridiculously fun.\n\nSo let's take the plot strands one by one...\n\nCurtis was not expecting to come back from the dead after Kiera killed him. Months later, the Freelancers retrieved his body and revived him, but the process somehow connected him to the founder of the Freelancer organization — a mysterious figure named the Traveler, who traveled back to the past to try and thwart other time travelers. I guess this founder is immortal, because he's still alive and locked in a room in the back. Curtis decides that the Traveler is a prisoner of the Freelancers, rather than their leader, and decides to bust him out. (Where is Wesley Crusher when the Traveler needs him?)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTo that end, Curtis joins forces with Brad Tonkin, the visitor from the alternate future who brought some fancy technology back with him. But after Brad double-crosses him, Curtis teams up with Kellog, who somehow knows exactly when Brad and Kiera will make their move on the Freelancer HQ. So Curtis \"piggy-backs\" on Brad and Kiera's assault, and frees the Traveler from his cage.\n\nThe show went to so much lengths not to show us the Traveler's face, it seems likely he's a version of someone we've already met.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBrad Tonkin was sent back in time to kill Alec Sadler, whose Halo bracelets created the hellish future that Brad comes from. But after Brad killed the other Kiera, he got randomly hit by a truck and got a case of amnesia, after which he and the remaining Kiera became friends. And he decided he was no longer up for killing Kiera's friend Alec, either version. Brad fights Curtis and apparently snags his high-tech device — the same one the Liber8 crew was trying to steal from that bank vault. This device is Brad's \"Plan B\", in case rescuing Hoodie Alec from the Freelancers doesn't work.\n\nKiera has become very comfortable with killing lots of people. She basically murders half the Freelancers herself, and causes the other half to get killed through her actions. The Freelancers are a bit ruthless, but they seem to be trying to do the right thing and keep the timeline from contamination (something Kiera also supposedly wants) and they trusted Kiera and let her handle things her own way. So it's kind of a bummer that Kiera decides to go ahead and murder so many of her so-called friends just to correct her own mistake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKiera has decided that she gave \"the wrong Alec\" to the Freelancers. And she agrees to give them Brad Tonkin in exchange for Hoodie Alec — but then she double-crosses them and busts Hoodie Alec out with Brad Tonkin's help. She hopes that Hoodie Alec can fix Suit Alec's mistakes, launching the Halo technology decades before it's supposed to exist — but instead, Hoodie Alec is pissed at her for locking him up in the first place, and in no frame of mind to help anybody. So she just lets Hoodie Alec run away with Emily. Oh, and Carlos gives her the intact time machine that Hoodie Alec buried.\n\nDillon gets a pretty good send-off in this episode. One of the episode's standout scenes is the one where he and Carlos debate the ethics of what Dillon is doing, being on the board of Piron and putting corporate interests ahead of the public good. Carlos is only there to disassemble the time machine, so the Freelancers don't come and attack them, but it winds up leading to the best discussion of Dillon's tactics we've gotten thus far.\n\nDillon wants to claim that he's just using Alec and his corporate resources, because that's what the police have always done — used the rich and powerful for their own purposes. And Dillon's argument is basically that there's a war going on, against terrorists and against highly organized criminals, and the cops need to be better equipped, with more surveillance. And the government can't give them what they need, so they have no choice but to go with Piron. Dillon's argument underscores the idea that the Liber8 crew from 2077 actually just hastened their own dystopian future by wreaking so much chaos that the surveillance state had to develop faster to react.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe most revealing part is where Dillon asks if Carlos is going to keep busting Dillon's balls, and Carlos says yes. Dillon replies, \"Good,\" because he needs someone to keep questioning his decisions. But at the same time, Alec gives a hint of how things really are, when he basically orders Dillon, his lackey, to violate police procedure and get him the time machine from the evidence lock-up: \"Just get it done, Jack.\"\n\nWhen Sonia is leaving Piron HQ, Carlos manages to get her at gunpoint (because she wants to be caught, I guess), and Dillon orders him to shoot her in cold blood, after she's surrendered. Carlos won't comply, and later launches an internal investigation of Dillon — just as Sonia takes matters into her own hands (literally) and blows up herself and Dillon.\n\nSonia is the only one of the time-traveling Liber8 members who can't accept that their mission is futile. She gets Julian (whom she also treats somewhat like a lackey) to obtain the code for the Halo bracelet from Alec's computer, and then Lukas designs a virus that will induce massive terror in anyone wearing one of those bracelets. Then she sneaks into Piron HQ, using a disguise Clark Kent would be proud of, and seduces a nerd in the mainframe room to get access, so she can install the computer. (And apparently with all its security, nobody at Piron figures out that she's done this, even after she's caught.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd Sonia finally reveals the truth to Julian: that she and the others are time travelers from a future where Julian is Theseus, the anti-corporate revolutionary leader who kills \"thousands.\" But maybe in this new timeline, things will be so different that Julian can find a non-violent way of handling things, says Sonia — right before she goes to blow herself up in a police station. Travis, who wanted to escape to the North with Sonia, is mournful when he realizes she's dead.\n\nSo where does this leave us? Suit Alec realizes that Hoodie Alec is free, and he knows that Kiera has \"changed her mind\" about which Alec to support. Sonia's virus is still connected to Halo. Hoodie Alec is running away with Emily. Kiera and Brad are getting cozy together — while Brad still has that \"Plan B\" device he stole from the Freelancers. Travis is probably going to do something to avenge Sonia. Curtis has just freed the Traveler from his captivity. And Kellog has some larger game he's playing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd with so many main characters dead or compromised, I'm still wondering if the show is going to hit the reset button next week.",
  "latent_12478": "\"Sorry fellas. Y'oughtta know gamblin ain't allowed.\"\n\nMarian shrugged her duster, the hazy light glinting off of her sheriff's star as she reached for the pile of coins on the table. Spurs jangled and leather creaked as the gamblers shifted in their seats. \"Marian, that money's mine.\" The saloon went stone silent.\n\nGuns flew from holsters, hammers cocked. Marian kept her barrel trained on the hard man sitting at the head of the table. They shared a smirk while the others kept their sights locked on the sheriff.\n\nMarian held a single coin between her fingers. \"Let's flip for it.\"\n\nThe Aftermath, by Per Folmer\n\nClink is a tabletop RPG about drifters, the creeds that bring them together, and the history that drives them apart. Tell a story inspired by spaghetti westerns, ronin tales, and shows like Firefly or Supernatural.\n\nWhether you're taking down the Crimson Dusk gang, uncovering the Oracle's mysterious treasure, or saving your partner from the lawbot's gallows, you'll have to expose the secrets of your past to overcome the dangers of the present.\n\nClink tells a non-linear story, crisscrossing between your characters' flashbacks and the risky business of the day. It's a flexible system that can support nearly any setting, so long as there's room for folks who aim to misbehave (six-shooters and door-kickin's encouraged too).\n\nClink draws inspiration from a long lineage of story games, and like its predecessors allows the players to deeply influence their world, their characters, and the shared story created around the table.\n\nThat said, Clink is unique in its focus on the inherent risk of flipping, spending, and accruing coins. The more you're willing to risk your character and put them between a shotgun and a hard place, the more you're able to command the action and develop your character.\n\nThe Getaway, by Per Folmer\n\nCharacters begin as rough sketches of the shifty sort you'd see in an old Western or Noir film. By spending hard-earned coins, the player is able to reveal more and more of their Drifter's personality through flashbacks and bitter memories.\n\nThe player flashbacks add spice to any setting, allowing the players to build out the world and support the story. This makes the GM's job easier, and gives every character a chance to shine.\n\nIn a world with no place for you, you have to find your own reasons for pushing on.\n\nWhen you begin a game of Clink, you and your group will come up with the creed that drives the action. Maybe it's \"Dodge the law and reach Haven,\" for a game of fugitives on the run. Maybe it's \"The Crazy Dog Clan will pay,\" for a game of hard-won justice (or revenge).\n\nCharge, by Per Folmer\n\nYour creed is your reason to fight against the world's trials. Whenever your character presses towards their creed despite the obstacles, you're rewarded with a coin -- a chance to reveal your past and overcome the odds.\n\nIt's a cruel world, and as your drifter gains scars, they're in danger of losing sight of their creed. Drifters can only resist their wanderlust for so long; if everyone loses sight of the creed, their camaraderie dissolves and the game ends.\n\nWhat kind of life have you lived? Who fears you, hunts you, loves you?\n\nWhen the game begins, your drifter is a mystery. All we know is your name and the mementos you carry. Singing Raoul, who never makes a sound except to play his copper harmonica. Jessica Hard-Heart, whose locket clatters against her metallic torso.\n\nAs you play, you'll earn coins from following your creed and roleplaying your character's habits. These coins give you the chance to narrate a flashback of your past, and use that memory to tackle the troubles of the present.\n\nUnder the Table, by Per Folmer\n\nWatched by the slavering beasts controlled by the Overseers, Madeleine recalls her years in the diamond mines, giving her the strength to strike her shovel into the hard tack once again.\n\nBecause players are creating these flashbacks on the fly and giving context to the current action, the GM doesn't have to worry about creating overly-intricate plots or fleshing out every detail of the world. They can provide the action, and the players will give it a deeper meaning. This means less time for prep and more time playing.\n\nAny drifter worth their salt knows that survival is one part experience and three parts luck.\n\nWhen push comes to shove in Clink, it's time to start flipping coins. A \"heads\" gets you what you're going for, but every \"tails\" sends you deeper and deeper into trouble. The details all depend on what we've learned about your drifter's past.\n\nIf you're an experienced sharpshooter, you can be sure you'll hit the target you're aiming for. But when the coin lands on \"tails,\" you might be hit with the troubling memory of that shot you wish you had missed. That scar will eat away at your resolve, and with enough scars you'll lose sight of your creed.\n\nCold Justice, by Per Folmer\n\nIf you're a greenhorn with a rifle, you can't be sure you'll even pull the trigger. Even if you flip a \"heads,\" something'll go wrong; maybe you made the shot, but tumble off your perch from the surprise of the gun's recoil. Each time you flip poorly, the situation will escalate even further. Roll three \"tails\" and you might find yourself hightailing it out of town with an angry mob at your heels!\n\nResolution in Clink is fast, full of narrative punch, and always leaves you with new and dramatic and situations. It's a system that rewards gutsy action and in-genre character development.\n\nRead the Draft\n\nThe game is written and thoroughly playtested. If you want to give it a shot and see how it works, you can read the draft here.\n\nBook Specs\n\nThe book will be laid out by Evan Rowland and illustrated by Per Folmer. The PDF will be optimized in RGB for screens, with internal linking and bookmark for each section within the table of contents.\n\nThe physical book will be offset printed by Nocturnal Media through its printing partners in Hong Kong (who have done literally thousands of books and cards for SSP and Nocturnal to this point). The book will be 5.5 x 8.5\" and roughly 80 pages.",
  "latent_12556": "Yesterday, major GOP donor Meg Whitman and Congressman Richard Hanna announced they would support the candidacy of Hillary Clinton for president.\n\nIt's not surprising that either individual would defect to the Democrats. Both are relative moderates on most issues. Both are social liberals.\n\nBut reading headlines the last few hours would lead one to believe that the entire Republican Party is in meltdown with nervous politicians wondering whether they should repudiate their nominee. Meanwhile, the press is in full-throated howl with speculation running rampant that Trump is going to be forced to drop out, or that everyone from RNC Chairman Reince Priebus to the lowliest backbench congressman was set to jump ship and, like Whitman and Hanna, vote for Clinton.\n\nThis feeding frenzy based on anonymous sources and wild speculation is unprecedented in the history of presidential campaigns. But Trump has only himself to blame for it. With talk of \"interventions\" and a \"suicidal staff,\" each hour brings fresh revelations about the state of the GOP and Trump's candidacy that even a casual voter would find off putting.\n\nIs any of it true? The defections of Whitman and Hanna are real enough, but what about other prominent Republicans?\n\nAllahpundit on GOP defections:\n\nInteresting timing. This isn’t a case of Team Clinton springing into action this week to capitalize on disgust over Trump’s scrap with the Khans. Hillary called Whitman before the conventions. She’s probably called many other Republicans since. In fact, if there’s an element of convenient timing here, it likely has less to do with when Hillary recruited Whitman than when she asked Whitman to go public about it, hoping that the news breaking now would compound the sense that Republicans are staging a mutiny against Trump. The Whitman story is, I’d guess, a carefully choreographed signal to Chamber of Commerce GOPers that there’s plenty of room still available on the Hillary train. And if that’s true, Team Clinton may already be preparing to roll out other big-name endorsements this week to amplify the perception of a GOP meltdown. Who’s next? I doubt Carly Fiorina would switch to Clinton after spending most of her primary campaign swinging a hatchet at her, but if there’s anyone Fiorina might like less than Hillary, it’s Trump.\n\nSo how much of this froth the press is churning up is to be believed? No doubt there are pockets of Republicans who are ready to jump ship in frustration over the stupidity of the candidate. But for the politicians running for re-election, they really have little choice but to stick with Trump -- for the present. For every vote they gain by showing \"independence\" in abandoning the candidate, they will probably lose a vote from an angry Trump supporter. For most candidates, repudiating Trump is a zero-sum game.",

  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nHave we gone trophy-crazy as a society, bestowing trophies on children for almost anything, even just showing up? Are we afraid children will be hurt by losing, so we make everyone a winner? Or are awards an effective way to raise children’s self-esteem and keep them motivated to do better?\n\nDo we give children too many trophies?\n\nIn the Op-Ed piece “Losing Is Good for You,” Ashley Merryman writes about the decades-old trend of giving children countless participation trophies and awards.\n\nAs children return to school this fall and sign up for a new year’s worth of extracurricular activities, parents should keep one question in mind. Whether your kid loves Little League or gymnastics, ask the program organizers this: “Which kids get awards?” If the answer is, “Everybody gets a trophy,” find another program. Trophies were once rare things — sterling silver loving cups bought from jewelry stores for truly special occasions. But in the 1960s, they began to be mass-produced, marketed in catalogs to teachers and coaches, and sold in sporting-goods stores. Today, participation trophies and prizes are almost a given, as children are constantly assured that they are winners. One Maryland summer program gives awards every day — and the “day” is one hour long. In Southern California, a regional branch of the American Youth Soccer Organization hands out roughly 3,500 awards each season — each player gets one, while around a third get two. Nationally, A.Y.S.O. local branches typically spend as much as 12 percent of their yearly budgets on trophies.

First, though, they must remain in the country for six months.\n\nInna Shevchenko, another FEMEN founder who is not related to Alexandra Shevchenko and who heads the group’s Paris branch, received asylum form France earlier this year.\n\nThe decision to flee Ukraine came days after a raid of FEMEN’s headquarters in Kyiv on Aug. 27 by police, during which a World War II-era pistol and a grenade were discovered. The Shevchenko district police said they had received an anonymous tip that the group was in possession of an explosive.\n\nShevchenko told the Kyiv Post by phone on Aug. 27 that the raid appeared staged and that the weapon and explosive had been planted.\n\n“When I saw how they were searching, it was like a show, a scene from a movie, and the police and SBU (security service) were like actors – they came in, and skipped two rooms and went almost exactly to the spot where they uncovered a (grenade),” she said. “These items were clearly planted.”\n\nAs a result, a criminal case was opened against the activists under Article 263, “illegal possession of weapons,” an offense punishable by up to five years in prison.\n\nAlso this month, FEMEN’s activists and a colleague of the group endured multiple, violent attacks, first in Kyiv, and later in Odesa.\n\nAs a result of these incidents, the radical feminist group, known for staging topless political protests, announced that it would close its Ukrainian headquarters in central Kyiv.\n\nThe group emphasized in a statement, however, that “such repression will not stop the active movement in Ukraine, Russia and other dictatorial states.”\n\n(This article was updated to reflect statements that Alexandra Shevchenko gave to the Kyiv Post.)\n\nKyiv Post editor Christopher J.

The documentary, Stripped, is a self-described \"love letter to comic strips\" that includes interviews with, among others, Jeff Keane of Family Circus, Richard Thompson of Cul de Sac and Watterson himself.\n\nThe poster shows a cartoonist being startled out of his clothing and into his birthday suit by a headline about the death of newspapers — all as his tablet-reading dog looks on.\n\nWatterson told The Washington Post, \"Given the movie's title and the fact that there are few things funnier than human nudity, the idea popped into my head largely intact. The film is a big valentine to comics, so I tried to do something really cartoon-y.\"\n\nAs fans — and viewers of the recent documentary Dear Mr. Watterson — might already know, Watterson is just as famous for his reclusiveness as for his panels about a shock-headed boy and his tiger. He also refused to license images from Calvin & Hobbes, which is why the characters never appeared on lunchboxes or as stuffed animals.\n\nLast year, Dear Mr. Watterson filmmaker Joel Allen Schroeder told NPR's Don Gonyea, \"I think he had a sense that that sort of licensing would diminish the significance, the meaning of his characters. That suddenly if Hobbes was a plush doll, does that answer that mystery of 'Is Hobbes real? Is he a toy?' ... What Calvin says in the strip, does that have as much meaning if he's on a Happy Meal?\"\n\nThe Post reports that Watterson's second public artwork since 1995 is also in the works. Watterson describes it as \"a silly picture that sums up my reaction to the current publishing upheaval.\"",

  "latent_13342": "This story is the second installment of a three-part series examining the so-called discipline gap among student groups who receive out-of-school suspensions in the Austin Independent School District. Read Part One here.\n\nDuring the 2013 school year, African-American students made up eight percent of the AISD student population, but nearly a quarter of the students given an out-of-school suspension.\n\nThe discipline gap is not unique to the district; nationwide, black students are suspended at higher rates than their peers. In March, the U.S. Department of Education reported the trend in black student suspensions starts as young as preschool.\n\nWhile many, including AISD officials, admit the discipline gap exists, fewer people seem to have a solid answer as to why.\n\nExperts say culture, communication and curriculum all play a role. UT College of Education professor Richard Reddick and Seattle Central Community College professor Daudi Abe recently discussed the reasons African-American students may be suspended at higher rates than their peers. Here are three possible reasons for the discipline gap, based on their interviews:\n\n1. Lack of Cultural Awareness : Several African-American parents and community members feel many teachers and administrators do not understand the culture and socioeconomic background of many of the students.\n\n\"So often, schools require students to leave their culture, leave their heritage at the door and convert to what we have, instead of saying, 'We embrace what you have,'\" Reddick says. \"And that doesn’t happen unless you have a clear understanding of what the community does.\"\n\nReddick and Abe agree that many times, student behavior is linked to issues they may be dealing with outside the home: caring for younger siblings, a lack of role models, or the distractions that come with working to provide income for their families.\n\nReddick says two ways to fix these issues is through cultural competency training and a diverse teaching staff. While you don't always need a minority teacher to teach minority students, dealing with multiracial students at a high school level requires experience. Many times, Abe says, high needs schools are staffed with newer teachers, and many school districts mostly employ white teachers.\n\n\"It's not necessarily unrealistic to think their first meaningful interactions with people of color, and African-Americans specifically, could come the first time they enter a classroom and are teaching these multiracial groups of students,\" Abe says.\n\nLast year, less than seven percent of teachers in AISD were African-American. Two-thirds (66 percent) were white.\n\nWhile most schools establish criteria for mandatory removal of a student from the classroom – like fighting, physical aggression towards teachers and drug possession – Reddick says at other times, disciplinary actions can be extremely subjective. Everyone – white, black or Hispanic – grows up with preconceived notions about others that, if not addressed, can play a role in people's actions.\n\n\"Until you do self-examination and expose your own biases, you'll always look at these kids as being problematic, as endemic of something else,\" Reddick says. \"An upper-middle class student who talks in class is exuberant and eager to learn, whereas a Latino or African-American student is disruptive.\"\n\nWhich Austin Schools Have the Most Suspensions Year to Year?\n\nData visualization by Roy Varney\n\n2. Lack of Communication: Abe says different communication styles between white teachers and black students can sometimes create misunderstandings. While European-American communication styles are more structured and discourage impulse and emotion, while also putting value on facts and certified authority, African-American communication styles tend to be more participatory and impulsive – \"styles like call and response,\" he says.\n\n\"Anyone who has gone to a black church knows what I mean,\" Abe continues. \"Many teachers view these behaviors as rude, inconsiderate, disruptive and they penalize students for them. Those kind of basic issues around diametrically-opposed cultures set the foundation for some of these larger conflicts that escalate into situations where children are removed from the classroom.\"\n\nAbe says sometimes there's a lack of understanding between students and parents about why students are suspended in the first place. Students could be raised by parents who were also suspended when they were in school – parents who don't have the tools to work with the school to create a more cooperative and positive learning environment for their children. Abe says more parent education is needed on high needs campuses.\n\n3. Curriculum: Reddick says most schools do a great job teaching African-American history every February for Black History Month – but they fail to teach about the accomplishments and cultures of African-Americans throughout the school year.\n\n\"If kids are coming to school and they don’t have opportunities to learn about their contributions from their culture or background or role models, it becomes drudgery,\" Reddick says.\n\nTomorrow: Part Three looks at what AISD is doing to close the discipline gap among student groups and reduce home suspensions across the district.",

  "latent_13767": "Editor's Note: As of December 2016, the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative is known as Measure S.\n\nNew poll data shows that the controversial Neighborhood Integrity Initiative ballot measure likely won't pass in March 2017. We'll get into the details, but first, a quick recap for those who haven't been following this particular fight.\n\nThe Neighborhood Integrity Initiative, a wolf-in-sheep's-clothes of a ballot measure likely to appear before voters in March 2017, positions itself as being about preserving Los Angeles from the dangers of overdevelopment, but what it would really do is freeze all development in the city for the next two years. More specifically, the NII would place a citywide two-year moratorium on any projects that require a zoning change, and permanently prohibit any projects that require amendments to L.A.'s General Plan. Not giving exemptions, that sounds reasonable right?\n\nHere's the problem: LA's planning process is fundamentally, painfully out of date (all but six of the city's 35 community plans, which make up part of the General Plan, are more than 15 years old), which means that almost every major project ends up needing exemptions of some kind, given how archaic the guidelines are. Mayor Eric Garcetti and City Council called on the City's Planning Department to revise those guidelines earlier this year, though that process likely won't be completed until 2026. That's the one thing the NII gets right—that we desperately need to update those plans, and the ballot measure would call for them to be updated within a two-year period, but putting the city on ice for two years is far too high a price to pay.\n\nEarlier this month, the initiative's backers announced a slew of celebrity supporters (who knew, apparently NIMBY sprawl is the only thing Leonardo DiCaprio likes more than girls born in 1992! #yolo) and tried some hostage negotiation tactics with Mayor Eric Garcetti, offering to dump their campaign if he met a list of demands within a week. He did not, and they did not. So the battle continues.\n\nOn Monday, opponents of the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative released new polling data showing that (at least by their count, and that of polling firm Fairbank, Maslin, Maullin, Metz & Associates) the NII likely won't pass on the March 2017 ballot.\n\nTheir poll, which was conducted in May 2016 using simulated ballot language based on the NII petition, drew the support of only 37% of likely March 2017 voters, with 44% opposed and 19% undecided. While that information should be comforting given our thoughts on the NII and its potential effects, we'd like to remind our readers that approximately 12 people vote in our March elections (just kidding, but unfortunately not by that much: last year's March election saw a dismal turnout rate of 8.6%), so this thing could still totally pass. And you should be really scared about that possibility.\n\nAs even our most out-of-touch citizens surely know, L.A. is in the middle of a serious housing crisis at the moment, and it's in this context that the potential effects of the NII get Halloween-level terrifying.\n\n\"We feel that this measure is going to be really devastating for affordable housing,\" Anne Miskey, CEO of the Downtown Women's Center, told LAist.\n\n\"A moratorium on projects would be bad for prices, I think unquestionably.\"\n\n\"The lack of housing in Los Angeles is the main reason we have so many people living on the streets and in shelters. We have almost 15,000 women in the county experiencing homelessness and this measure is just going to make it impossible for them to find homes. We need to have more housing, not less,\" Miskey said, adding that there was \"a broad coalition\" within the affordable housing and homelessness services provider communities \"that says this is just the wrong way to approach this.\"\n\nAccording to Paavo Monkkonen, a housing scholar and Urban Planning professor at UCLA, a larger housing supply isn't necessarily going to lead to a drop in prices, \"but the increase is going to be lower than it would be otherwise.\"\n\n\"A moratorium on projects would be bad for prices, I think unquestionably,\" Monkkonen said.\n\nWhat's especially troublesome, according to policy expert and Abundant Housing cofounder Mark Vallianatos, is the manner in which the NII would undercut or block a big portion of new housing in the city. Simply put, the NII would be \"a horror show\" from a housing perspective.\n\nAs Vallianatos, who cowrote The Next Los Angeles: The Struggle for a Livable City explained over the phone, General Plan amendments and zone changes are both essential to the production and approval of new housing in the city. Last year, we saw the most new housing units permitted in the City of Los Angeles in more than 25 years.\n\n\"If you look at the units that are permitted, something like 60% sought either a General Plan amendment or a zone change, which shows that the very procedures that the NII would seek to ban or restrict are the ones that are creating a lot of our housing, at a time when we need tons of new units.\" Just as important but perhaps less discussed is the effect of General Plan amendments and zone changes on displacement, or perhaps more accurately, the lack thereof. These are both tools that can allow new units to built in large numbers without demolishing almost any existing units. After studying the data from last year, Vallianatos found that 20 developments in Los Angeles sought General Plan amendments, leading to permits for 7,522 new units, which would demolish a total of six units. That's a more than one-thousand-to-one ratio of new units to demolished units.\n\n\"It's pretty impressive,\" Vallianatos said. \"If i was trying to quote-unquote preserve L.A., as in preserve the actual people and buildings of LA, I'd be all over this. I'd be like 'let's do more of this,' right? And instead, this is what they want to permanently ban.\"\n\nAs mentioned above, the NII would also dictate a two-year moratorium on any zone changes for projects that go from less dense to more dense (i.e. making a single-family home into multifamily units, or turning a parking lot into a mixed-use complex). By Vallianatos' calculations, last year 1,196 new units were approved using zone changes for projects that would lead to a total of 12 existing units being demolished. That's almost exactly a hundred-to-one ratio of new units to demolished units, so not quite as extreme as the thousand-to-one ratio above, but still pretty good.\n\nAs Vallianatos explained, these two processes (General Plan amendments and zone changes) are \"amazingly comparatively efficient at getting units up without directly displacing people.\" They are \"much, much better in terms of not getting rid of any other homes than the general development that we've seen over the past several years.\"\n\n\"I feel like the fact that the Neighborhood Integrity Initiative is going after these two types of development shows that they are completely out of touch with the needs of the city,\" he said.\n\nAn Expo Line test train rests at the La Cienega station, with the downtown L.A. skyline in the distance. Photo by Steve Hymon/Metro via Wikipedia.\n\nBeyond the housing crisis, Los Angeles is also in the midst of transitioning into a different kind of city—a more walkable, transit-oriented, less segregated city. Research has also shown that zoning regulations that restrict the density of a neighborhood correlate to higher housing prices, and more segregation. And preserving Los Angeles under formaldehyde and outdated zoning guidelines would stop that transition in its tracks.\n\n\"It would slow it down and hinder it,\" Vallianatos said, speaking of how the NII would affect that transition to a more transit-oriented city. \"And that's the point of the NII. In some ways, it's a last gasp effort by veterans of decades of slow-growth politics in Los Angeles, who see the writing on the wall that we are starting to shift, and that younger people are starting to want a different way of living, and so they're trying to put legal brakes on that evolution.\"\n\n\"What makes it even worse,\" he added, \"is that we as taxpayers are spending tens of billions of dollars of our sales tax money expanding Metro and making other changes, and then to have this group of people who already have their own homes and are our looking backwards instead of forwards, to have them come in and put a break on things would be very damaging,\" Vallianatos said.\n\n\"Building near the places where we've been investing in transit is especially important,\" according to Monkkonen. \"We don't want to waste all that money by building Metro lines that don't go to places where people live and work.\"\n\nSo what happens if it does pass? \"People who own houses will be fine with it, because they own a house. The big issue with this is for renters and people without a lot of money,\" according to Monkkonen.\n\nAnd in broader terms, also anyone who dreams of a more livable, connected Los Angeles. As Vallianatos said, \"The city exists for the people who live today, to try and make it better into the future. And we need to allow the city to adapt under changing circumstances.\"",
  "latent_13803": "Prohibition may have been repealed in 1933, but you'd barely know it from some of the alcohol laws still on the books in various states.

Also, the U.S. is one of the few countries that makes you wait until you're 21 to legally drink.\n\nWithout a doubt, one of the most confusing and frustrating aspects of these long-standing alcohol restrictions is trying to figure out what kind of booze you can buy in a given state's grocery stores.

CCed were ASI President Owen Schwaegerle, ASI Board of Directors Vice Chair Jana Colombini, as well as students Mehra Gharibian, Isamar Hernandez, Sam Holzer, Mick Bruckner, Kristin Lee and Mario Espinoza, who are all members of cultural clubs on campus.\n\nColombini responded by saying it was great that SLO Solidarity came up with a list.\n\n“I think they are taking a very proactive approach which is great, and they definitely have a reason to,” Colombini said. “I know as far as ASI goes we will be taking that list into great consideration.”\n\nHolzer, a member of SLO Solidarity, said the list of demands includes both short-term and long-term objectives. Some may be easily implemented right away, while others will take time and could be altered based on future campus climate.\n\n“A lot of the demands are subject to change as the situation on campus changes,” Holzer said. “This demands list is kind of a large outline for how we would like to tackle problems across the college.”\n\nSLO Solidarity organizers met with administrators earlier in the quarter to begin developing plans to meet the club’s goals, Gharibian said.\n\n“We had been in discussions for a while about an action plan, but this is just a follow-up, written-out document that lists demands from the larger SLO Solidarity group,” Gharibian said. “I’m not going to comment on what I think is going to happen until we have the action plan.”\n\nAdministration has been aware of disadvantaged students’ concerns for a long time, Klepfer said, but has done little to solve their problems.\n\n“There is no way that the administration was not already aware of the majority of our concerns. There is no way they had not already discussed most of the things we demand,” he said. “Admin has seemed very supportive of our movement. Actions speak louder than words, however, so we will wait until the action plan is released before deciding next steps.”\n\nBruckner said he hoped administrators would back their claims of interest in reaching minority students, but was skeptical because of the nature of the demands.\n\n“I am taking the demands with a grain of salt just because the actions that they listed require so many resources, funds, energy and kind of just a huge shift in ideological thinking,” Bruckner said. “I’m not sure if the admin is really going to put its money where its mouth is, (but) I would be absolutely thrilled if they did.”\n\nWe will update this post as we receive responses from administrators and student leaders.\n\nNaba Ahmed contributed to this report.\n\nUpdate 2:42 p.m.: Updated to include Armstrong’s and DeCosta’s responses.\n\nUpdate 3:07 p.m.: Updated to include Colombini’s response.\n\nUpdate 3:53 p.m.: Updated to include Holzer’s response.\n\nUpdate 4:14 p.m.: Updated to include Klepfer’s response.\n\nUpdate 6:06 p.m.: Updated to include Bruckner’s response.\n\nUpdate 7:48 p.m.: Updated to include Gharibian’s response.",

Nevertheless, traditional business models are no longer sustainable and high-quality publications, like ours, are being forced to look for new ways to keep going. Unlike many other news organizations, we have not put up a paywall. We want to keep our journalism open and accessible and be able to keep providing you with news and analysis from the frontlines of Israel, the Middle East and the Jewish World.\n\nAfter weeks of criticism, Germany’s Left Party in the country’s most populous state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) appears to have withdrawn its anti-Israel initiative.\n\nOn its Twitter account on Sunday, the Left Party in NRW said, “Motion to the situation in Palestine will not be dealt with.” The NRW Left Party did not immediately respond to The Jerusalem Post’s queries on Monday.\n\nThe initiative was proposed for passage at the NRW’s Left Party congress on Sunday. The motion called on Israel “to end the occupation and the Gaza blockade” and urged the European Union to end its association agreement with Israel because of the Gaza blockade and Israel’s “construction of a border wall that violates international law.”In response to the motion in early October, Martina Renner, a Left Party MP, wrote on Twitter that the “motion sounds like it was written from Israel boycott groups. From this the executive board of @dielinke clearly distances itself.”Some of the signatories to the motion blasting Israel have, over the years, been accused of stoking antisemitism and hatred of the Jewish state in Germany. The Simon Wiesenthal Center included MP Inge Höger, one of the motion’s supporters, on its list of top 10 antisemitic/anti-Israel incidents in 2014.According to the center, there were “ongoing efforts to demonize Israel by a group of extreme anti-Israel MPs, led by Inge Höger and Annette Groth.Both of these parliamentarians were onboard the controversial 2010 Mavi Marmara Gaza flotilla and upon their return to Berlin, were hailed by many of their party’s MPs.”Höger played a role in bringing extremists of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement against Israel to the Bundestag in 2014.MP Ulla Jelpke, who supported the motion, previously said: “I consider it legitimate to be against Zionism. After all, it has apartheid-like characteristics.”The three-page motion said 2017 is the 100-year anniversary of the Balfour Declaration “in which the former colonial power Great Britain unilaterally created a Jewish home state.”Journalist Stefan Laurin first reported on the NRW’s Left Party motion, writing on the website Ruhrbarone that the party foments “incitement against Israel.” He said the motion shows “how deep the hate of Israel” is within the Left Party in NRW.Laurin wrote that the NRW’s Left Party did not mention in the motion that the blockade against the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip is also maintained by Egypt. He added that the blockade was the Jewish state’s reaction to “permanent attacks of Hamas on Israel.”Laurin said it is the “terroristic Hamas with its regime that is responsible for the misery in Gaza.” He added, “Hamas builds shopping centers and villas for its corrupt leadership.”The Left Party in NRW, a state with roughly 18 million people, did not secure votes to re-enter the state parliament in this year’s election.\n\nJoin Jerusalem Post Premium Plus now for just $5 and upgrade your experience with an ads-free website and exclusive content.

The change in venue is believed to have been made to enable the event to accommodate not just more people, but also more booths and exhibits that feature gaming-related products.\n\nTalking about video games, the PGF Summer Assembly 2017 will obviously become a hub to check out and even try different games across multiple platforms, from PC to Console and even Mobile, as the event not only puts Esports at the spotlight, which it did in its previous years, and as such, we are listing down all the current games that you can see and test at the Pinoy Gaming Festival Summer Assembly 2017.\n\nTom Clancy’s Ghost Recon Wildlands\n\nDeveloper: Ubisoft Paris\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One\n\nThe newest addition to Ubisoft’s Tom Clancy video game franchise puts players in the shoes (or sights) of the fictional elite tactical military group called ‘Ghosts’ as they traverse mountains, forests, deserts and salt flats to carry out missions and as well as explore the open world. The game’s theme centers around the war against drugs, which many Filipinos can surely relate though, although instead of shooting suspected peddlers on the sidewalk, this one brings the war right into the doorsteps of a state-controlling cartel.\n\nMobile Legends: Bang bang\n\nPublisher: Moonton\n\nPlatform(s): Mobile (Android, iOS)\n\nThe popularity of MOBA, its striking resemblance to other pre-existing popular titles, and the Filipino love for free games help give testament to the sudden popularity of Mobile Legends: Bang bang. This mobile MOBA title has taken the Filipino crowd by storm and has easily become one of the most popular mobile titles locally, and is said to even contest the top spot together with Supercell’s Clash of Clans and Clash Royale.\n\nProject Xandata\n\nDeveloper: Secret 6 Inc.\n\nPlatform(s): PC (under development)\n\nThe homegrown development team that is Secret 6 Inc., who initially started as an outsource partner for projects such as Uncharted, is well on their way to releasing their first title, the Online Multiplayer First Person Shooter named Project Xandata. While it has been previewed last year in ESGS 2016, Project Xandata’s appearance in PGF Summer Assembly 2017 marks the first time that a locally made game is granted a major spotlight share in the event so you better be sure to visit Secret 6’s booth to find what all the buzz is about with their upcoming fast-paced shooter.\n\nLeague of Legends\n\nDeveloper: Riot Games\n\nPublisher: Garena (South East Asia/Philippines)\n\nPlatform(s): PC\n\nNow surely you can’t have a multi-game event in the Philippines without League of Legends, I mean, how can the world’s consistent top-ranking, most played PC title not find its place in PGF SA 2017?\n\nJust Dance 2017\n\nDeveloper(s): Ubisoft Paris, Ubisoft Pune\n\nPublisher: Ubisoft\n\nPlatform(s): PC, PS4, Xbox One, PS3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Wii, Nintendo Wii U\n\nLove video games and dancing or better yet, love playing video games WHILE dancing? Then drop by PGF Summer Assembly 2017, and show of those moves in Ubisoft’s Just Dance 2017. First released back in Oct 2016, Just Dance 2017’s updated tracklist include recent pop and dance hits (obviously) such as Justin Bieber’s Sorry, Ariana Grande’s Into You, and even PSY’s Daddy. Don’t worry too much about all the dance steps though, just follow what the screen shows you, hit those perfect marks and you’re on your way to be a (Just) Dance star.\n\nCounter Strike: Global Offensive\n\nDeveloper: Hidden Path Entertainment\n\nPublisher: Valve\n\nPlatform(s): PC\n\nThe Counter Strike franchise holds a dear place in the hearts of many Filipino gamers, especially those who lived through the era of 1.3 and 1.6, as it introduced us to what competitive gaming feels like with all the spray control, the proper grenade throws and the voice of your screaming teammates as you bounce the Flashbang right back, blinding everyone in the process while the enemy team peppers you with hot white lead. A visit to PGF Summer Assembly 2017 will invite you to enter the realm of Counter Strike: Global Offensive, if you haven’t yet, and let you enjoy the intensity of rushing towards B, the multiple smoke grenades at, and clutch kills all over again.\n\nDota 2\n\nDeveloper: Valve\n\nPublisher: Valve\n\nPlatform(s): PC\n\nOf course the grandson of the granddaddy of the MOBA genre will make its appearance in PGF Summer Assembly 2017, after all, it’s Filipino fans don’t wanna be left out just because Riot’s MOBA takes a share of the spotlight. #PEENOISEGAMING UNITE!\n\nVainGlory\n\nDeveloper: Super Evil Megacorp\n\nPublisher: Super Evil Megacorp\n\nPlatform(s): Mobile (Android, iOS)\n\nTalking about granddaddy’s and grandson’s, one of the few first successful takes on the MOBA genre on Mobile, Super Evil Megacorp’s VainGlory will be heading to PGF Summer Assembly once again after their first spot last year. Now looking to become the Philippines next’ big Esport title, VainGlory has already hosted pro tournaments on a global scale with its first ever World Championship event held in Hollywood, USA late last year.\n\nMore to come\n\nAs we are still about 2 weeks away from PGF Summer Assembly 2017, we are expecting more announcements from the organizing body, Gariath Concepts in regards to the featured video game titles, and of course other gaming partners. Note that the event is of free admission, although we advise that you bring a nice, large enough backpack because who knows what freebies you can grab and win from PGF Summer Assembly 2017’s event partners.\n\nThe Pinoy Gaming Festival Summer Assembly 2017 will be this coming April 28 – 30, 2017 in the Trinoma Activity Center, Trinoma Mall, Quezon City.",

  "latent_14040": "Strong Employment Growth in February\n\nWhat Industries are Doing Best?\n\nThe February Jobs Report, released today by the BLS showed strong job growth. More than 235,000 new jobs were added to the American economy, exceeding expectations by more than 17%. The unemployment rate remained unchanged at a low 4.7%, but the strong increase in new jobs indicates many previously discouraged unemployed workers are re-entering the labor force. Strong gains were made in the construction industry, despite the fact that the new presidential administration has not yet released an official infrastructure development plan. Within the construction industry, the largest gains were made within the specialty trade contractor and heavy/civil engineering sectors. In total employment in the construction industry rose more than 58,000. In the past six months, the construction industry has created more than 177,000 new jobs, so the single month of February represents nearly one third of all new job growth in that area. Strong construction growth moving into the Spring and Summer months represents a positive sign for the economy.\n\nAnother surprise in this past month’s job report is the increase in manufacturing jobs. The manufacturing industry added more than 28,000 new jobs last month, with the strongest sectors being food manufacturing and machinery. The transportation equipment sector however, lost 6,000 jobs. Not all is lost with the transportation sector however, recreational vehicle construction has hit a production level not seen since the 1970s. This is a very strong indicator that consumer confidence levels are reaching highs not seen since before the 2008 economic recession.\n\nEven seemingly forgotten industries such as mining added new jobs this past month, increasing payroll by 8,000, which is surprising considering the industry hit a recent low shortly back in October of 2016.\n\nThe biggest loser in jobs report was retail, which lost 26,000 jobs. Facing stiff competition from online retailers, most notably Amazon, this comes as little surprise. Most recently, JCPenney announced they were closing more than 140 stores. Additionally, Sears and Kmart are closing 150 stores total. Workers in retail be would well-advised to start planning their exit strategy into a new industry soon.\n\nConsumer Confidence and the Economy\n\nHere’s more good news for the economy: Consumer confidence levels have hit a 15-year high. Consumer confidence levels measure the health of the business environment and optimism about the economy. Individuals surveyed who reported it was difficult to find a job returned to pre-2008 recession levels for the first time. In general, consumers are expecting the labor market to improve and the business environment to become more favorable in the near future.\n\nFor the average American, one might expect this to result in increased spending in the hospitality and professional services sectors. However, brick-and-mortar retail is not expected to greatly benefit, since activity has steadily drifted towards online retailers for the past decade with little indication of reversing.\n\nIs Trump Responsible for this Job Growth?\n\nWith mostly positive job reports since the election of Donald Trump, many are beginning to speculate whether or not he is responsible for the strong economic growth we have been reporting. As one commentator put it, the data is unclear as to how much influence a president has over improving the economy. Nonetheless, Donald Trump has been taking pride in the job growth and consumer confidence levels.\n\nHowever, many economists are attributing this strong job growth to Obama. Social media feuds have been erupting about who is responsible for the strongest February job growth rate in three years. Even Slate Magazine is pushing back against the idea that Trump is responsible for the increase in job growth.\n\nDespite the high job growth in the construction and manufacturing, Donald Trump has yet to release a comprehensive infrastructure program, which he promised during his campaign. It remains unclear when, where, and if this will be released.\n\nTime for a Career Change\n\nWith a changing economy, individuals need to prepare themselves to be able to take on new responsibilities and duties. Brick-and-mortar retail, traditionally one of the largest employers, has been consistently losing jobs due to increase in popularity of online retailers. Luckily, individuals in these roles have developed many transferable skills, including customer service, conflict resolution and task management.\n\nLooking for a career change?

  "latent_14110": "Your browser does not support the audio element.\n\n2016 was a turbulent year for EVA Airways.\n\nFacing external threats like a sluggish economic recovery, intense airline industry competition, frigid cross-strait relations, the rising risks of local politics, and higher oil prices, EVA Air was forced to contend with the death of founder Y.F. Chang and the ensuing power struggle for the chairmanship.\n\nEven though it was under siege inside and out, EVA Air still managed to quietly change the face of Taiwan’s airline market.\n\nLast year, despite a precipitous 46 percent drop in net profits, leaving just NT$3.47 billion, EVA Airways set a new record for consolidated revenue of NT$144.68 billion, giving it a golden cross for revenue with China Airlines for the first time. Revenue and profits both surpassed that of the old national carrier, but can EVA Air ride this momentum to further growth and firmly claim the top position among local airlines?\n\nKey #1: Offsetting Price with Volume\n\nUpon entering EVA Air’s 16th-floor office in Taoyuan, it is hard not to notice a giant screen with little dots moving all over it. Each little dot is an airplane in real time, shown taking off and landing at points all around the world.\n\nThe man at the helm is Steve Lin, chairman of EVA Airways.\n\nFollowing a previous stint as the airline’s chairman from 2005 to 2011, Lin took the helm once again last March amidst a struggle for control.\n\nSpeaking of the challenges of his second turn in the pilot’s seat in his first exclusive media interview, Lin calmly said, “I think in essence it’s the same, as there are always challenges. Every move we make is made for growth, or to put it plainly, to make profits.”\n\nProfits were down last year, which in addition to increased carrying capacity and costs, can also be attributed to “competition, and lower ticket and transportation prices, which in turn lowered transport income per unit,” says Lin.\n\nLast year the average EVA Air passenger ticket price dropped by 9-10 percent. Meanwhile, cargo demand was sluggish under the poor economic climate, resulting in diminished revenue, cargo throughput, and income per unit for EVA Air Cargo.\n\n“The market is falling, and it’s impossible for us not to fall with it; the only thing we can do is fall slower,” says Lin, noting that the key for EVA Air to maintain momentum is a high occupancy rate.\n\nAccording to statistics from the International Air Transport Association and the Civil Aeronautics Administration, the average occupancy rate in 2016 across the international transportation market was 79.6 percent, with the Asia Pacific region at 78.6 percent. While China Airlines’ rate was 78.4 percent, EVA Air managed to reach 80 percent.\n\n。\n\nEVA Air corporate planning division executive vice president Albert Liao relates that market competition and growth is a dynamic balance. The overall transportation market is growing, with current global passenger volume at four billion trips, and room for growth of up to three billion more individual trips per year within the next 15 years. EVA Air’s strategy is to ensure its position as one of the main participants in the market, “relying on growth to boost volume, and offsetting price with volume,” says Liao.\n\nKey #2: Early Positioning\n\nOne unusual reason Taiwan’s civil aviation industry has not been as profitable as it might have been is the reduction of cross-strait flight routes. According to statistics from the Taiwan Tourism Bureau, there was negative growth for the first time among tourists from China in 2016, down 670,000 individual visits, or 16 percent, from 2015.\n\nThe impact on EVA Air was comparatively light, as cross-strait passenger traffic accounted for just 10 to 13 percent of the company’s turnover last year, compared to around 15 percent for China Airlines and 35 to 40 percent of business for TransAsia Airways, which was dissolved last year.\n\n“Due to the prevailing environment, the overall economy has not been able to stage an effective recovery. Yet even under the threat of terror attacks and discount airline competition, EVA Air has staged stable growth,” says Dr. Ker-tsung Lee, associate professor at Feng Chia University's Department of Transportation Technology and Management. “There is some impact from cross-strait routes, but long-haul and trans-oceanic routes are stable, which offsets the difference.”\n\nOver the course of his interview, Lin mentioned repeatedly that airline industry operations must “look long-range, and take early action,” a description that encapsulates many aspects of Eva Air’s business territory.\n\n“We identified North America a long time ago as a market we could get into, and now is the time,” including the purchase of airplanes, and preparation of personnel, for which the ground has long been readied. And these steps were taken with even more purpose following EVA Air’s entry into the Star Alliance in 2013.\n\nStar Alliance figures show that more than 45 million trips were made between North America and Asia in 2016. EVA Air is targeting the gigantic North American market with this in mind, aggressively expanding destinations and flights.\n\nTaiwan also enjoys geographical advantages, and EVA Air has concentrated efforts on positioning Taiwan to become a transit market between North America and Southeast Asia, setting up a route network like spokes around a hub (developing multiple destinations around one airport as the hub), continuing to add flights. Currently the airline serves eight destinations in North America, with nearly 90 flights per week. In 2016, transit passengers in Taiwan grew by 27 percent, and EVA Air continues to expand its Northeast Asian and Southeast Asian routes. The strategy has been effective, as Japanese and Korean travelers alone grew by 14 percent over the previous year in 2016.\n\nProceeding with long-haul route deployment, EVA Air has not only eliminated less efficient airplane models, but has also been precise and timely in its new airplane purchase strategy.\n\nEVA Air’s fleet currently stands at 81 planes. “EVA Air began deploying Boeing 777s fairly early; the 777’s twin engines are more fuel efficient than other models,” relates Tay-lin Hwang, professor of Aviation and Maritime Transportation Management at Chang Jung Christian University. In addition, the company’s airplane procurement plan has long been mapped out through 2020, including plans to incorporate the fuel-efficient Boeing 787 Dreamliner into the fleet.\n\nEVA Air has a stellar ‘fatality-free’ record in its 27 years of operation. Last year, the airline was given a five-star rating by airline service rating authority Skytrax, giving EVA Air the distinction of being the eighth airline ever and Taiwan’s first to earn that distinction.\n\nEVA Air knows very well that service is the key to brand differentiation. By adhering to its market position and segmentation, and not touching discount airlines, EVA Air has managed to skirt the risks of major losses.\n\nKey #3: Bridging Upstream, Downstream Industries\n\nProfessor Jin-Ru Yen of the National Taiwan Ocean University Department of Shipping and Transportation Management observes that EVA Air’s stable performance can be attributed to three factors: First is an excellent brand image, with a top flight safety record, and a young fleet averaging just 4.7 years old. Second is corporate culture, with long-term efforts to cultivate talents and reduce turnover. And third is the company’s outstanding reinvestments, so that it is immune to competition from discount airlines. Evergreen Aviation Technologies Corp. and Evergreen Air Cargo Services Corp. have also led the way to increased profits, so that “EVA Air can be considered the leading brand among Taiwan-based airlines,” concludes Yen.\n\nUnder the leadership of former CEO Chang Kuo-wei, EVA Air invested in such subsidiaries as Evergreen Aviation, Evergreen Aviation Precision, and GE Evergreen Engine Services to encompass the entire production scale from manufacturing and maintenance to transportation services.\n\nEvergreen Aviation has achieved double-digit revenue growth over the past three years. Last year, it took on contracts to retrofit 20 Boeing 767-300 passenger jets into cargo planes, greatly benefitting the company’s core undertakings.\n\nC.K. Po, secretary to the Minister of Defense, and former secretary-general of the Taiwan Aerospace Industry Association, is bullish about EVA’s future. “The previous chairman, Chang Kuo-wei, is familiar with the aerospace industry, and takes air transport seriously. The aerospace industry is a long-term investment, and Eva Air got an early start,” he says.\n\nSteve Lin also believes that, in addition to its core enterprise, EVA Air would be best served by consolidating its upstream and downstream holdings to maximize synergy. No matter how the winds change in the greater environment, Lin always seems calm and collected, sure that EVA Air can rely on its system, structure, and teamwork.\n\nAs for EVA Air surpassing China Airlines for the first time, Lin is confident that EVA Air has gotten to a point where it can compete and thrive together with other airlines. “Competition will only make the overall industry better and better,” he says.\n\nThe skies are vast, and which of Taiwan’s two major airlines will stay on a steady heading towards greater growth will surely be demonstrated over the long haul.\n\nTranslated from the Chinese by David Toman",
  "latent_14267": "A British citizen has applied for a judgement against Facebook after the company failed to file a defence in a case that will test the right of technology companies to disclose personal data on UK residents to the US National Security Agency.\n\nKevin Cahill, a journalist, claimed in documents filed in the Mayors and City of London County Court that disclosures by Facebook put it in breach of the British Data Protection Act (DPA).\n\nCahill, who believes Facebook may have released his personal data in breach of UK law, is seeking £1,000 in damages from the company.\n\nThe action follows revelations by Edward Snowden that American social media companies have been sending foreign users’ private communications to the US electronic spying organisation. The programme, known as Prism, is enforced by top secret US court orders.\n\nCahill has asked the court to issue an order requiring Facebook to “disclose the authority or order on which it based the removal of data from the United Kingdom”.\n\nHe is seeking a second order to require the social media company to “desist from any further breaches of the Data Protection Act\", both generally and specifically in relation to his own data.\n\nFacebook, which did not acknowledge or contest the claim, has declined to comment.\n\nThe other contributors to the Prism programme were named in the Snowden documents as Yahoo, Google, Facebook, PalTalk, AOL, Skype, YouTube and Apple.\n\nCahill has also brought actions against Microsoft UK and Google UK. Microsoft has opted to contest the case. Google has until 25 December to reply to the claim.\n\nCahill said he was pleased with the outcome of his Facebook challenge. “There is no excuse whatever for any foreign companies to break the law here by stealing personal data.

If not, any place will do.\n\nRule 2 – Choose a rock when everything is quiet.\n\nRule 3 – You may have to lay on the ground to look a rock right in the eye.\n\nRule 4 – Don’t get a rock that is to big.\n\nRule 5 – Don’t get a rock that is to small.\n\nRule 6 – It should feel easy in your hands.\n\nRule 7 – Look for the perfect color.\n\nRule 8 – Choose the right shape.\n\nRule 9 – You have to smell the rock.\n\nRule 10 – Don’t ask anyone to help you choose.\n\nLike I said, I’m paraphrasing. All the rules have a beautiful message like rule 9. It explains you need to smell your rock to find out where it’s from, perhaps from the ocean or the middle of the earth. It also says most grown-ups can’t tell these kind of things because they don’t smell as well as kids. I love that this book encourages imagination. Thoughout the entire book, it talks a lot about finding your rock. The one that speaks to you. Then in rule 10, it says you’ll have to make up your own mind. You’ll know.\n\nThis is an amazing activity and I highly recommend this book. We have gone out looking for rocks a few times and my son has yet to find THE rock.

  "latent_14446": "Department has carried out 60 internal reviews following deaths, and campaigners say those cases likely to be tip of the iceberg\n\nThe Department for Work and Pensions has been urged by mental health and disability charities to publish its secret investigations into suicides that may have some link to benefit changes, following revelations that it has carried out internal reviews into 60 such cases.\n\nA Freedom of Information request by the Disability News Service has revealed that the DWP has carried out “60 peer reviews following the death of a customer” since February 2012. A peer review is triggered when suicide or alleged suicide is “associated with a DWP activity”, according to its internal guidance.\n\nDespite growing concern over the way benefits are administered in relation to vulnerable individuals, and amid a number of reports of related deaths, the department told the Guardian it had no plans to publish the reviews.\n\nDisabled People Against the Cuts said that, because of the way the reviews were carried out, the DWP figure was likely to be the “tip of the iceberg”.\n\nTom Pollard, the policy and campaigns manager at Mind, told the Guardian the figures were a concern. He stressed that suicide was a complex problem but added: “It would be helpful for organisations to see what things could be going wrong in the benefit system that could lead to these tragic situations.”\n\nSue Bott, director of policy and services at Disability Rights UK, said DWP reviews should be transparent.\n\n“There have been allegations and anecdotal evidence for a while that the benefits regime has tipped people over the edge. It should be looked into in a transparent way,” Bott said. “This is not just about the nature of the decision taken as to whether it was right or wrong. It’s also about the process and there is a lot of concern about the way benefits are administered.”\n\nThe DWP’s latest figures show that sanctions to punish disabled ESA claimants had risen by 470% in 18 months, from 1,096 in December 2012 to 5,132 in June 2014.\n\nAccording to DWP figures released as the result of an FoI request, 62% of adverse ESA sanction decisions in the first three months of 2014 were made against people with mental or behavioural problems (9,851 out of 15,955).\n\nThe calls for transparency from the DWP come after a number of reports of the deaths and suicides of vulnerable individuals after adverse benefit decisions.\n\nDavid Clapson, 59, a former soldier and type-1 diabetic, died in July after his benefit was cut. Clapson had no food in his stomach, £3.44 in the bank and no money on his electricity card, leaving him unable to operate his fridge where he kept insulin.\n\nMPs are to look into his death after a petition written by Gill Thompson, his sister, gathered more than 200,000 signatures.\n\nThompson, told the Guardian: “All I’ve ever asked for is lessons to be learned. I can’t bring him back but we should know what is going on. There are certain people who shouldn’t be sanctioned. People with terminal cancer, waiting for heart operations, people with diabetes. Before they sanctioned my brother, they knew his disability. He was waiting to hear from a job, he had been on work placement. He was claiming the bare minimum.”\n\nChristine Norman, a nurse whose disabled sister, Jacqueline Harris, took her own life in November 2013 after her benefits were cut, said: “It’s too late for my sister. Everything is stacked against you. If you’ve got a great education, if you have great health, you’re OK. But if you haven’t, you have to fight against the odds. The government want you to work. The ones they pick are the ones that are vulnerable and ill.”\n\nAn inquest found last month that Harris, 53, of Bristol, who was partially sighted, took her own life after months of constant pain and following a “fit for work” ruling that replaced her incapacity benefit with jobseeker’s allowance. Staff at a jobcentre Harris was told to attend had to call an ambulance after she blacked out in pain.\n\nDisabled People Against Cuts said that, because the DWP’s reviews only relate to suicides or alleged suicides and were triggered by regional managers within the benefit system, the number of deaths was likely to be far higher than the 60 cases that reached review.\n\nAnita Bellows, of Disabled People Against Cuts, said: “The triage for advising whether a peer review is to be carried out is done by regional managers at seven regional centres, who may not have an interest in putting them forward. Also, the guidance for peer review is focused on suicide, which does not cover people like David Clapson.”\n\nShe called on the DWP to open a proper investigation into the deaths, and include evidence from medical experts. “These should be public documents” she said. “They are also only focused on the process. There are no medical experts on it.”\n\nThe DWP said it was unable to disclose the names of individuals under review because of provisions of the Social Security Administration Act.\n\nHowever, the Mental Welfare Commission of Scotland, a Scottish government-funded watchdog, published its comprehensive review of the suicide of a claimant known only as Ms DE this year. The MWCS concluded that the WCA process and the subsequent denial of ESA was at least a “major factor in her decision to take her own life”. It concluded that the work capability assessment process was flawed and needed to be more sensitive to mental health issues.\n\nColin McKay, chief executive of the Mental Welfare Commission of Scotland, said he was disappointed with the DWP response to the report on Ms DE, who died on 31 December 2011.\n\n“Certainly, nothing in what they said gave us confidence that if another Ms DE was claiming benefit, the outcome would be any different,” he said. “If the number of deaths are 60, that’s a lot. You would expect any organisation experiencing deaths as the potential consequences of their actions would be seriously considering whether they needed to do anything differently.”\n\nThis year a whistleblower tasked with getting claimants out of the ESA sickness benefit told the Guardian that some of her clients were homeless, many had extreme mental health problems – including paranoid schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and autism – and some were “starving” and extremely depressed after having benefits stopped. “Almost every day one of my clients mentioned feelings of suicide to me” she said.\n\nMind released research on Thursday that found that people with mental illness were having their benefit cut more than those with other illnesses. It also found 83% of those with mental health problems surveyed said their self-esteem had worsened, and 76% said they felt less able to work as a result of DWP back-to-work schemes.\n\nThe DWP said: “We take these matters extremely seriously, which is why we carry out peer reviews in certain cases to establish whether anything should have been done differently. However, a peer review in itself does not automatically mean the department was at fault.\n\n“Since its introduction in 2008 there have been four independent reviews of the work capability assessment and we have made significant improvements to make it better, fairer and more accurate.”",
  "latent_14577": "An accused Al Qaeda bomb-maker who went to college in Arizona told military officials at the U.S. base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, that he believed an unnamed member of the Saudi royal family was part of an effort to recruit him for violent extremist acts before the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to a newly released transcript.\n\nGhassan Abdallah al-Sharbi said a religious figure in Saudi Arabia used the term \"your highness\" during a telephone conversation with a man, just before urging al-Sharbi to return to the U.S. and take part in a plot against the U.S. that would involve learning to fly a plane.\n\nThe Sept. 11 commission found there was no evidence to indicate that the Saudi government as an institution or Saudi senior officials individually had supported the attacks, and the kingdom's government has consistently denied it had any role in the plot.\n\nIt was early 2001, and al-Sharbi had only recently returned from the United States, where he had taken some flight school courses in Phoenix with two men who would become hijackers in the 9/11 attacks.\n\nAl-Sharbi described the conversation in June to the Periodic Review Board, which assesses whether Guantanamo prisoners can be released. The Pentagon on Thursday posted a transcript, with parts blacked out, on the website of the board, which includes representatives from six U.S. agencies and departments.\n\nThe statement is convoluted and lacks important details, such as whether the \"religious figure\" might be close to any Saudi officials. It does not indicate who the Saudi royal might be. The term can be used for thousands of members of the Saudi royal family; al-Sharbi did not say he met the man.\n\nAl-Sharbi also appears to be struggling with illness. He tells the board he had just come from the detainee hospital, is \"really exhausted, and nauseous and lethargic,\" and uses what is described as a \"manual breathing device.\"\n\nHis statement adds to a list of suggestive but hardly definitive clues about possible involvement by members of the Saudi establishment in the Sept. 11 attacks, in which 17 of the 19 hijackers were Saudi.\n\nThe Saudi Embassy in Washington declined to comment on the al-Sharbi transcript. In the past, the Saudis have pointed to the 9/11 Commission, FBI investigations and other probes that found no Saudi government or royal family involvement in the attacks.\n\nThose denials have not ended speculation about possible Saudi involvement. Congress recently approved legislation that would allow 9/11 families to sue the kingdom for any role in the plot.\n\nAl-Sharbi says he listened as the \"religious figure\" spoke to the man — whom al-Sharbi believes was a royal — as they discussed al-Sharbi's qualifications for returning to the U.S. for jihad. \"I remember, 'yes, your highness, yes your highness,' and he was talking to him about me,\" al-Sharbi said.\n\nSaudi Arabia has battled with Al Qaeda over the years, but there have been consistent allegations, including by Guantanamo prisoners, of financial and other support by officials and members of the royal family for Al Qaeda-linked charities, said terrorism consultant Evan Kohlmann, who reviewed the 28-page transcript at the request of The Associated Press.\n\n\"The Saudi royal family is quite large and diverse, and it is no secret that various members were once reputed for their patronage of Islamist causes and charities,\" Kohlmann said. \"In that light, it is hardly ridiculous that al-Sharbi would have encountered a Saudi royal who sympathized with Al Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden.\" Bin Laden was a Saudi citizen.\n\nThe prisoner's candor about his health also may add to what is otherwise a plausible allegation, said Max Abrahms, an assistant political science professor at Northeastern University who studies terrorism. Abrahms also reviewed the transcript.\n\n\"He is very open that he is really struggling physically, that he's exhausted, that he has been under serious medication,\" Abrahms said. \"But on the other hand it lends additional credibility to his statement because it's not very deliberate and not memorized.\"\n\nA Guantanamo spokesman, Navy Capt. John Filostrat, said the military does not disclose details about detainees' health. \"Overall, the general health of detainees is good,\" he said.\n\nAl-Sharbi attended Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Arizona, from 1999-2000, according to the review board website.\n\nIn the transcript, the prisoner described living with various Americans, including a Phoenix police officer, in Arizona and California before returning to Saudi Arabia in the summer of 2000.\n\nAfter telling the \"religious figure\" that he had some practice on a flight simulator and could learn to fly more easily than others, al-Sharbi says he agreed to return to the U.S and they began to discuss details. But al-Sharbi never went, for reasons that are unclear in the transcript.\n\nThe review board profile says al-Sharbi went to Afghanistan in the summer of 2001, trained with Al Qaeda and then went to Pakistan, where he learned how to make remote-controlled explosive devices and teach the skill to others. He was captured there in a house with Abu Zubaydah, whom the U.S. has called an Al Qaeda \"facilitator.\" He, too, is confined at Guantanamo.\n\nWhen captured, the FBI found a buried a cache of documents nearby, including an envelope from the Saudi Embassy in Washington that contained al-Sharbi's flight certificate, according to a document known as File 17, which was declassified earlier this year and names people the hijackers were in contact with in the United States before the attacks, including diplomats of the kingdom.\n\nIn July, the review board declined to approve his release from Guantanamo, where he is among 61 prisoners still held.",
  "latent_14609": "Kirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt’s time for Round 3 between the San Francisco 49ers and Seattle Seahawks.\n\nIt was always hard to see the season boiling down to anything else—Bleacher Report, Sports Illustrated, and Pro Football Focus all had San Francisco and Seattle 1-2 in the NFC in their preseason power rankings, and both teams were similarly high in the ESPN and Football Outsiders preseason editions. Unlike the recent trend in the postseason, there really isn’t a \"surprise\" team left at this point in the playoffs—both the 49ers and Seahawks, as well as their counterparts in the AFC, have earned this spot by being one of the top teams in the NFL this season, rather than simply getting hot at the right time.\n\nEarly betting lines have the Seahawks favored by roughly a field goal, which is a fairly standard advantage for the team with home-field advantage. That feels roughly correct—both teams have played well this season, and both own victories over the other when in their home stadiums. This is only the fourth time the 49ers have rolled into a game as the underdogs, but the label seems roughly accurate for this game.\n\nIf the 49ers hope to return to the Super Bowl, they’re going to have to do what they couldn’t do in Week 2—beat Seattle on its own turf. It’s a tall task, though as Arizona proved this season, not impossible. How can the 49ers pull the upset and become the first team to reach back-to-back Super Bowls since the 2003-04 New England Patriots?\n\nLet’s look at some of the key factors.\n\nCounteracting Home Field Advantage\n\nAl Messerschmidt/Getty Images\n\nYou can’t compare the two earlier 49er-Seahawk showdowns without pointing to the effect of home-field advantage.\n\nSince 2002, the Seahawks have had the best advantage in football playing at home, getting an extra 5.2 points per game just from staying in the Emerald City. They are 72-31 in the stadium and have lost by more than one score only 15 times.\n\nThe noise is obviously a factor, as the Seattle fans have set the world record for crowd noise and have forced opposing teams to false start more than any other home crowd in football, but it’s not just the noise. You also have the geographic isolation factor, as there are no short road trips up to Seattle—the closest team is San Francisco, and that’s still 800 miles away.\n\nAdd in the rainy, cold weather late in the season and you get a very foreboding place for a road team to play.\n\nHow do you counteract this advantage? The largest key is not to get into too deep a hole early and to try to take the crowd out of it. That’s a much easier thing to say than to do—the crowd will be pumped for the NFC Championship Game, and the 49ers have been very bad at just getting up to the line of scrimmage and getting a play off in time, even without the kind of deafening noise to be found at CenturyLink Field. The crowd noise there caused a league-leading 12 delay-of-game penalties and anecdotally seem to cause teams to burn two or three timeouts a game just trying to line up properly.\n\nIf that happens in Seattle, the 49ers have no chance—if they get rattled and can’t simply get plays off, Seattle is going to roll in this game.\n\nIf, however, they can slow down the tempo early, avoid turnovers and put together the sort of long, time-consuming drives they’ve been capable of this season, they can bring that crowd interference down to manageable levels.\n\nOtto Greule Jr/Getty Images\n\nIn the second matchup between the two teams this year, the 49ers had three drives of ten plays or more, accounting for nearly a quarter of the entire game and resulting in the game-winning score.\n\nAlthough all three drives ended up in field goals, as opposed to touchdowns, these are the sorts of drives the 49ers need in this game. Yes, a game-breaking kickoff return or long bomb for a touchdown would be nice and silent the crowd momentarily, but a) the 49ers aren’t particularly designed for that, and b) the cumulative effects of these long, clock-killing drives can more thoroughly subdue if not demoralize the crowd—not to mention the fact that it tires out the defense.\n\nThe 49ers have two of the top-four longest drives in the league this year—a 17-play, 10:27 drive against Tampa Bay, and an 18-play, 9:32 drive against Arizona. If they import that long-drive success into Seattle, the 49ers can go a long way to lessening the effects of Seattle’s crowd advantage.\n\nSan Francisco’s Offense Improving\n\nOne of the big stories this preseason was the arms race in Seattle and San Francisco, as the additions of Percy Harvin and Anquan Boldin bolstered the teams' respective receiving corps. Of course, Harvin missed nearly the entire season with a hip injury, and the 49ers’ loss of Michael Crabtree to his Achilles injury counteracted the addition of Boldin.\n\nThe 49ers suffered more from the loss of their receiver, as the offense sputtered for the first half of the season, only to begin reviving when Crabtree returned in early December. Once he did come back, the 49er offense was able to operate with its full complement of weapons.\n\nIn the preview for last week’s game against Carolina, I posted the stats for Colin Kaepernick and the 49ers’ passing game, split into pre-Week 10 and post-Week 10 segments. Here are the updated stats, taking the Carolina game into account, now with nine games in each split:\n\nColin Kaepernick Att Comp Comp % Yds Yds/Att TDs Ints Weeks 1-10 221 124 56.1% 1675 7.58 9 6 Weeks 11-19 255 150 58.4% 1945 7.63 14 3\n\nStephen Dunn/Getty Images\n\nOverall, the 49ers’ offense has gone for more than 300 yards in each and every game of their active eight game winning streak, including the home game against Seattle. They gained 318 yards in that matchup, compared to 207 in the first go-round.\n\nWhy the difference? Part of it is the return of Crabtree, who had four receptions for 40 yards in the game and simply gave Kaepernick another valid target in the passing game. A fully healthy Vernon Davis helped, as well—he left with a hamstring injury in the first Seattle game, further robbing Kaepernick of targets to throw to.\n\nIt wasn’t just the passing game that was able to find success, as the running game also picked up 63 more yards in the second matchup than in the first. That stat is a bit skewed, though, as 51 of those yards came on a Frank Gore rumble late in the fourth quarter to move the 49ers into range to kick the game-winning field goal. For the majority of the afternoon, the running game largely was as effective as it was in the first matchup, averaging just under 5.0 yards per carry.\n\nThe 49ers ground attack has actually slipped a little in the second half of the season, dropping from 147.7 yards per game to 129.4—that’s more than made up for, however, by the increase in the passing offense, which has risen from an average of 173.9 yards to 201.9.\n\nAgainst the Seahawks in that second matchup, Davis worked the seam routes to perfection, Boldin fought contested balls tooth and claw with Seattle star cornerback Richard Sherman and came away victorious, and Crabtree showed his route-running was not affected by the layoff.\n\nThe passing game gave enough room for Frank Gore to plow for holes through the line; he racked up 33 carries in the second game as opposed to only 20 in the Week 2 matchup in Seattle, which helped San Francisco control the clock and the flow of the game.\n\nThe health of the offense was a huge contributing factor to that victory.\n\nSeattle’s Offense Declining\n\nMike DiNovo-USA TODAY Sports\n\nIt looked like this third matchup would feature the full receiving corps for both teams, as Percy Harvin made a quasi-miraculous return against New Orleans a week after nearly landing on the injured reserve list. During the game, however, Harvin was knocked around by the Saints secondary, leaving for concussion tests at two different points in the game, as well as being seen in a shoulder harness after the game.\n\nAs for the championship game, we won’t know Harvin’s full status until Wednesday or Thursday, due to the time the concussion protocols take to complete. It’s fair to call him questionable for Sunday, with somewhere around a 50-50 chance to suit up.\n\nFor most of the season, of course, Seattle didn’t need Harvin. The offense was rolling—they ran over San Francisco to the tune of 172 yards on the ground in the Week 2 game, and have cracked the 400-yard mark offensively six times this year, something the 49ers haven’t managed to do since Week 1.\n\nHowever, just as the 49ers’ offense has been heating up, the Seahawks’ offense seems to be cooling down. Over the same eight-week period we discussed earlier, in which the 49ers have been over 300 yards each and every week, the Seahawks have struggled, registering less than 300 yards four times, with the nadir being the Week 16 home loss to Arizona, in which Russell Wilson and ended up with 89 yards through the air.\n\nSome of these recent struggles can be explained away by things outside of on-field execution—the subpar offensive performance last week, for instance, was in large part the result of extraordinarily windy and rainy conditions, far surpassing what even Seattle normally faces.\n\nJoe Nicholson-USA TODAY Sports\n\nStill, four games out of eight points to a trend.\n\nIt’s not Marshawn Lynch, either—the worst rushing performance in that time span was the 86 yards against San Francisco, which is one of the two stingiest run defenses they faced in that stretch of games.\n\nRather, it’s the passing game: over the last five games, Russell Wilson has completed 56.7 percent of his passes for 788 yards—only 6.6 yards per attempt. He’s also thrown only four touchdowns and has been intercepted three times.\n\nMake no mistake, Wilson’s had a fantastic season overall, but the passing game has struggled to close out the season.\n\nWhile the 49ers game is included in that sample, it didn’t feel like Wilson had a horrible game against them the second time out, as the Seahawks actually increased their passing yards from 118 to 178 between the two games. Part of that is a lack of quarterback pressures—in Week 2, the 49ers pressured Wilson on 21 dropbacks but charted only seven such pressures in the Week 14 rematch.\n\nA lot of that difference can be attributed to Aldon Smith getting to go against Paul McQuistan and J.R. Sweezy in the first matchup and having to deal with Russell Okung in the second go-round. A lack of pressure from Smith and 49ers defensive front in the second matchup was partially compensated for by the secondary clamping down tighter. Both Tramaine Brock and Eric Wright provided outstanding pass coverage.\n\nThe weak link in that second matchup was Carlos Rogers, who allowed six receptions on eight targets for 71 yards, much of it to Golden Tate. Rogers’ status is still unknown for the championship game, but Brock and Tarell Brown have been the 49ers' cornerbacks of choice recently anyway—the matchup between them and Tate will go a long way towards determining what the offense can do.\n\nMarshawn Lynch is a beast no matter what—against the Saints, he forced 13 missed tackles and has 99 on the season so far, according to ProFootballFocus’ charting stats, meaning he is a pain to get down. However, if the 49ers can shut down Seattle’s passing offense, forcing them to become one dimensional, their odds of winning improve dramatically.\n\nGetting Around the Defense\n\nKirby Lee-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThere is no getting around this fact—the Seahawks don’t have a weakness on defense.\n\nBy nearly every metric, Seattle has been the best defense this season, including Football Outsiders’ overall DVOA stat, where they’ve opened up a ten-point lead over their closest competitor. The Seahawks have multiple Defensive Player of the Year candidates, the best pass rush and pass coverage in football and a solid run defense.\n\nThey play a brand of physical, rough defense and never let opposing offenses get comfortable. If the 49ers are going to have their ninth straight 300-plus yard game, they’re going to have to find ways to crack their toughest task so far.\n\nKaepernick was pressured 21 times in the first matchup, leading to three interceptions and three sacks—there simply wasn’t time for him to read Seattle's coverages. These pressures weren’t coming from the blitz, either—Seattle blitzed only five times, mostly just clamping down on the depleted receiving corps and preventing Kaepernick from finding anywhere to go with the ball.\n\nThe second matchup went better, as the 49er offensive line held up a little better, allowing 10 pressures. Joe Staley, in particular, had a much better day the second time around.\n\nThe pressures simply have to be down, especially when not blitzed. That’s going to be key in this matchup. If Mike Iupati has another day where he gives up six hurries, as he did in the first matchup, the 49ers aren’t going to be able to move the ball well enough to win this game.\n\nThen there's the very tall task of playing a road playoff game in the loudest stadium in the NFL. The inability to hear the snap count removes the offensive line’s normal advantage—they know when the snap count is, meaning in normal situations, they don’t have to watch the ball, while the defense does. With the deafening noise, however, the offensive line has to pay attention to the ball more than their blocking assignment at the snap, which can lead to disaster.\n\nHarry How/Getty Images\n\nSo, how to attack the top defense in football?\n\nRemember, what was mentioned in the 49ers’ offensive section—San Francisco's averaged nearly five yards a rush against Seattle in the two matchups this year. It’s not just the 49ers, either: The Saints used a power rushing attack last week, getting 108 yards on 24 carries behind Mark Ingram and Khiry Robinson.\n\nA heavy dose of running the ball isn't New Orleans normal offensive strategy, but a combination of the weather and Seattle's suburb pass rush led the Saints to try a power-running strategy, and they had notable success. Arizona, too, found success on the ground in their Week 16 upset, with Andre Ellington and Rashard Mendenhall ending up with a combined 139 yards on the ground. You see the same pattern in Seattle’s overtime wins against Tampa Bay and the Houston Texas, as well as in its near loss to St. Louis in Week 8, all of which saw Seattle’s opponent go for over 150 yards rushing.\n\nIt is possible to get traction on the ground against the Seahawks' front seven.\n\nJonathan Ferrey/Getty Images\n\nA heavy dose of Frank Gore, with a side of Kendall Hunter, seems to be in the cards for this matchup. The running game helps control the clock, quiet down the crowd and reduce the impact of Seattle's devastating secondary.\n\nIt felt like the 49ers got away from their smashmouth approach too early in the first matchup, recording only three rushing attempts after halftime. It was still 5-0 at that point, far too early to give up on the ground game. This isn’t a \"run to win\" sort of argument; the reason winning teams have more rushing yards than losing teams, in general, is because they run to bleed the clock when they're already winning.\n\nThis is more of a balance argument. By essentially giving up on the running game in the second half of the Week 2 matchup, the 49ers not took the ball out of the hands of one of their top playmakers, but they became one dimensional and allowed the Seattle defense to double down its efforts to stop the passing attack without worrying about the ground game.\n\nBecoming one dimensional removed the threat of the play-action pass, and it played right into the strengths of a defense which doesn’t need extra help to be a dominant force. The worst-case scenario for the 49ers is becoming predictable; they need to keep that running game going strong to have a chance in this one.\n\nOverall Strategy\n\nSo, breaking it all down, what’s San Francisco’s strategy in this one? Run the ball, hang on to the football, and control the clock. Make sure the drives end in some sort of points, forcing Seattle’s recently sputtering offense to keep scoring, rather than just waiting to take advantage of a three-and-out or a turnover. Shorten the game, take the crowd out of it, and win the field position battle.\n\nThat’s a hard script to follow. When Seattle’s fully in gear, they are better than San Francisco on both sides of the ball. The thing is, they haven’t been fully in gear recently, while the 49ers are riding the biggest winning streak among the four remaining playoff teams.\n\nWill it be enough to overcome Seattle? That’s hard to say—the 49ers will likely need a couple breaks, as well as lights-out performances from both the offense and defense to come out on top of this one.\n\nHowever, as long as they can avoid being swept up and washed away early and prevent the emotions of the big game and the crowd noise to turn momentum in Seattle's favor, the 49ers have every chance to come out on top in this game.\n\nIt should be exciting to watch.",

  "latent_14915": "Gregory Maxwell & Gavin Andresen Shed Interesting Light on Bitcoin Block Size Debate\n\nOne of the main reasons why the Bitcoin block size debate has been attracting so much attention is that there is a growing number of network transactions that need to be validated. By increasing the Bitcoin block size limit, more transactions can be included in every network block. According to Gregory Maxwell, there is no real need to include more transactions per block just yet, as the situation is not as dire as people assumed.\n\nAlso read: Crypto-Psychology Initiation Text: Toward Understanding Money Symbolism\n\nIncreased Hashpower Makes Current Block Size Viable\n\nHaving more Bitcoin transactions on the network is an indication that the digital currency is becoming more and more popular. Granted, not all of those transactions are related to people buying or selling goods or services, but people are using Bitcoin to quickly transfer value between accounts nonetheless.\n\nAs a direct result, the discussion of increasing the Bitcoin block size reared its head, and developers have been looking for viable solutions ever since. But it looks like there is no imminent need to increase the current Bitcoin block size limit, as long as the overall network hashpower keeps increasing at a steady pace.\n\nOn December 10, 2015, the Bitcoin network saw a very high number in terms of network transactions, as 222,000 transfers were made in a 24-hour period. Unlike previous all-time highs, this event was not part of a Bitcoin network stress test, such as the ones that have taken place in previous months.\n\nDespite what some Bitcoin community members might have expected, the current maximum Bitcoin block size was not reached. This is not because of a more efficient Bitcoin network all of a sudden, but can rather be attributed to an increase in overall hashrate. Both aspects are much closer related than people gave it credit for, until now.\n\nOn Reddit, user BIP-101 explained the relationship as follows:\n\n“Currently, blocks are being found at an average of 9 minute intervals. The next difficulty adjustment is a week away. Effectively, we have a 10% increased block size right now, or in other words 1.1 MB. So, while I said a while ago that we are already at capacity, this is still true. The hash rate increase just delayed the effects. We might not see congestion effects until the new year because over the Christmas holidays, transaction volume historically drops. But I’m calling it: In the new year (beginning of January), the effects will be the worse.”\n\nA Different Kind of Threat For The Bitcoin Network\n\nWhile this explanation makes perfect sense, it is important to keep in mind the opposite of this statement is equally true. If there is no steady increase in the transaction volume, hashrate pointed at the Bitcoin network will most likely start to drop off, due to the decrease in block rewards.\n\nAn increased block time would keep the Bitcoin network at a lower percentage capacity-wise, which means an increased block size is less of a worry. The Bitcoin mining difficulty will eventually adjust to this change, but it will take some time to complete the cycle. This scenario could create a vicious circle of reduced network usage due to higher transaction fees, which would further reduce mining revenue and more miners will drop out.\n\nGavin Andresen shared his thoughts on this scenario:\n\n“There is a real danger of a negative feedback loop– transactions fail to confirm, some people leave, price falls, hash power drops, more transactions fail to confirm……I THINK the miners would be rational enough to break the cycle, but it could get really ugly pretty fast. ALL of this is speculation, nobody really knows what will happen. That’s why I agree with something Jeff Garzik has been saying for a while: running up against the 1MB block size limit is a major change to Bitcoin economics.”\n\nIt is safe to say there is no end in sight for the discussion on if — and how — the Bitcoin block size should be increased in the near future. Every option has its advantages and disadvantages, and the final decision will have to be weighed carefully. At the same time, it is good to get some insights into the different trains of thought, and what their possible outcomes could be.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on the correlation between an increased Bitcoin network hashrate, and the block size debate?

  "latent_14935": "Kael'Thas, The Sun King\n\nThe Fantasy: Fragile hero from Warcraft 3, insanely powerful Raid boss from World of Warcraft. Ends-Justify-The-Means radical fighting for his people.\n\nThe Look: Pompous, Arrogant, sure in his abilities, easily enraged.\n\nThe Design: Fire. Lots of Fire. Manipulates magic and disrupts enemies on the battle field.\n\nThe result: In Heroes of the Storm, Kael'Thas manages to maintain his scary level of firepower, still threatening to decimate an entire group of heroes like he did during The Burning Crusade. However, his Warcraft 3 origins influence a large part of his talent options, including the ability to amass huge amounts of mana and kill clumped up units quickly. Instead of his core spell \"Banish\" we have Gravity Lapse (a nod to his WoW raid boss persona). Still green, still magical, and still his only defensive option.\n\nKael'Thas brings one of the oldest WoW mechanics and spreads it all over the nexus: don't spread the Living Bomb or we will all die. Fitting for the games only fire mage representative.\n\nJohanna, Crusadar of Zakarum\n\nThe Fantasy: The most defensive, unkillable class from Diablo 3. A playable character that wants to be attacked by everyone nearby. Driven by unshakeable purpose.\n\nThe Look: Steadfast, battle-hardened, immovable, gallant.\n\nThe Design: The crusader is defined by the shield. A watchful sentinel protecting allies against waves and waves of enemies. Crusaders don't look for fights, they just punish anyone who stands in their way.\n\nThe result: Although Johanna came late in the game's creation, most people would agree that she embodies everything you want in a Warrior class. Tanky beyond belief, playing her strikes true to playing a crusader in Diablo 3: run into the enemy and figure it out once everyone is trying to kill you. Johanna makes playing the \"boring tank\" feel more like playing the \"fearless leader\" which is a good thing, as it's exactly how she should be played.\n\nThe Butcher, Flesh Carver\n\nThe Fantasy: Terrifying Boss from the Diablo series. Never stops chasing you. Kills player surprisingly quick, teaching the most important lesson about Butcher Demons: don't let them touch you. As a boss, has obvious counter play to make up for devastating power levels.\n\nThe Look: Insane. Gleeful in his savagery. Simple, deadly, violent. A predator of anything living.\n\nThe Design: The Butcher can best be described as a Bull in a world painted red. If he sees something, he will kill it. He won't fight it, or engage in tactics, or maneuver around it, he will just kill it. The Butcher isn't trying to be clever when with his approach, he instead unsettles his opponents with mindless violence.\n\nThe Result: The Butcher in Heroes of the Storm needs to do two things: Chop meat and kill unsuspecting enemies. The Butcher changes any game he appears in, causing enemy squishies to play in fear throughout every stage in the game. He is a menace that preys on opponents who repeatedly fall for the same trick.\n\nBut true to his nature, the Butcher is not versatile. Like the series he appears in, clever heroes will dodge him and stay within the safe cover of obstacles or tankier allies.\n\nLeoric, The Skeleton King\n\nThe Fantasy: Disgraced King who went mad and boss of Diablo series. Leoric won't stay dead and, and although not King of the Skeletons, he is still a Skeleton King. Large swings, large weapons, powerful strikes and phantom like movements test player's mastery over their heroes and abilities.\n\nThe Look: Royal oppression and rage that comes from centuries of practice. Haunting and ghost like, slow shambling movement contrasted with unpredictable burst of speed and strength. Brings a sense of impending doom and dread.\n\nThe Design: Leoric is insane and fights with a style which showcases his madness. He curses you for bringing the warmth of light into his tomb, when he is the one that brought the tomb to you. His hatred for the living reveals itself through various life draining abilities and his iconic resistance towards staying dead. Leoric wants to kill everyone equally and large swings with an enormous mace is what you need to make that happen.\n\nThe Result: Playing against Leoric can sometimes feel depressing. He literally haunts the battlefield and his unstoppable mobility allows him to set the pace of any engagement. He is Royalty after all: he chooses to engage you, not the other way around. We have all had those moments where we think we are about to kill Leoric, only to realize he is the one gaining HP and you are the one losing it. Leoric might possibly be the most villainous feeling character in the entire game.\n\nSo it's only fitting that his biggest weakness lies in his tendency to get killed over and over again by an organize group of heroes.\n\nThese four heroes are big successes for the Heroes development team, and the feel of their play styles reflect the value of such a system to initiate a heroes design.\n\nWhat about the Rogue and Warlock teaser during BlizzCon 2014?\n\nDuring the Q/A part of the deep dive, someone in the audience asked if there would ever be a Rogue type class in the game. Blizzard teased that Edwin VanCleef of the Defias Brotherhood is the most logical choice to include, further mentioning Valeera Sanguinar or Vannessa Vancleef. We also got confirmation straight from the mouth of the developers that a Warlock hero is \"in the works\" and might possibly be incarnated as Gul'dan.\n\nThat was a year about a year ago, and the initial models of Leoric, The Butcher, and Johanna displayed on staged turned out to be almost exactly what the finished heroes looked like. Is it safe to assume that a Rogue and Warlock hero is farther along than we think, or are we due for more Starcraft heroes (and maybe even an Overwatch hero) before we revisit the Warcraft universe again?\n\nHere is to BlizzCon 2015. Keep speculating Heroes!",

  "latent_15080": "As we continue the Acme Packing Company mock draft, we land on the eighth overall pick owned by the Minnesota Vikings.\n\nBackground\n\nThe Vikings finished 5-10-1 in the 2013 season, with a three-man rotation of Christian Ponder, Matt Cassel, and Josh Freeman under center. The team started the season with three straight losses before finally notching a 34-27 win over the Steelers in London in Week 4. The Vikings would go on to lose four straight games and ultimately eliminated themselves from playoff contention by the month of November.\n\nThe Vikings defense took a step back in 2013, and the offense lacked much firepower other than the occasional big play from Adrian Peterson or Cordarrelle Patterson. The team showed a little spark towards the end of the season when the team handed the reins over to Matt Cassel in Week 13. Cassel displayed the ability to manage the game, and not make the big mistakes that both Ponder and Freeman are bound to make multiple times a game. With arguably the best running back in the league and a talented group of wide receivers and tight ends, the team appears to be a playmaking quarterback away from having a respectable offense that could keep the Vikings in a lot of games in 2014.\n\nWith the eighth pick in the 2014 NFL Draft, the Minnesota Vikings select...\n\nPlayer: Teddy Bridgewater\n\nPosition: Quarterback\n\nSchool: Louisville\n\nYear: Junior\n\nThe Vikings reached for Christian Ponder in the 2011 Draft when they selected him 12th overall, but this time a quality quarterback falls into their laps with the eighth pick. Bridgewater's stock appears to have taken a hit after his lackluster pro day performance, but he may end up being the best pro quarterback in the draft.\n\nBridgewater finished with 3,970 yards, 31 touchdowns, four interceptions, and a passer rating of 171.1 in his junior season under center for the Cardinals. He would be an instant upgrade to a position the Vikings haven't had a playmaker at since the early days of Daunte Culpepper (we've blocked a certain grey-bearded QB's stint with the Vikings from our collective memory).\n\nBridgewater is thought of as having a slight build, but appeared to bulk up in the offseason as he measured in at 6' 2-1/8 and 214 pounds at the Scouting Combine. Adding that bulk (and possibly a little more) would be much more durable when he does decide to make plays with his legs. Regardless of his size, Bridgewater would come into a situation where he won't be asked to carry the team on his back. He would likely only have to attempt 20-25 passes a game, with the added benefit of play-action passes with the use of Adrian Peterson as a decoy.\n\nThe defense will still be a dumpster fire, and don't be shocked if Zygi Wilf and his ridiculous moustache decide to do something strange instead of making the logical choice at No.8, but Bridgewater would definitely be a difference maker for the Minnesota Vikings in 2014.\n\nRound One Summary",
  "latent_15247": "PRESIDENT OBAMA has put job creation on the front burner — he outlined his new plan in a speech yesterday, and at last week’s jobs forum he said he was “open to every demonstrably good idea” to put Americans back to work.\n\nWell, here’s a proposition: Cities and towns across the country are the default owners of hundreds of thousands of abandoned and derelict single-family houses, apartment buildings and factories. These places are a blight on our communities.\n\nThe federal government should reimburse cities and towns who hire people from the unemployment rolls to tear down these structures, clean up the properties and, if there is no immediate buyer for them, to turn them into green spaces.\n\nNot only will this create jobs, it will also provide lasting economic value as the properties get placed back on the tax rolls. And the program would give clear evidence that the taxpayers’ (borrowed) dollars are producing a tangible public benefit. To encourage participation, Washington might consider giving cities and towns a 25 percent bonus — beyond reimbursing them for what they spend on reclamation. We could get such a program running by early next year, and it could run through, say, mid-2011.\n\nHow do we get started? The first step is to figure out how many abandoned properties are out there. Right now, we have no idea. A group like the nonprofit National League of Cities could gather information from cities and towns across the country. Once we have a new census of the derelict, we can estimate a cost, match jobs to those who do not have them and get to work.",
  "latent_15256": "The Canadian biologist Ian Stirling has spent much of his life with polar bears. Now seventy-five years old, he joined the Canadian Wildlife Service in the early nineteen-seventies, at a time when no one was doing much in the field beyond tagging the bears and waiting to see where they went. For years, the government paid little attention to how Stirling spent his time; he even did much of his own fund-raising. But, beginning in 2006, when the conservative, business-friendly government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper came to power, Stirling and thirty-six thousand other federal scientists were abruptly forbidden to talk about their work publicly, unless their statements had been vetted and approved by bureaucrats in Ottawa. The policy lasted for nine years, until 2015. In that time, according to Elizabeth May, the leader of Canada’s Green Party, Harper’s “Orwellian” requirement became “a humiliation for scientists, and brought us into international ridicule.”\n\nSince Donald Trump’s Inauguration, U.S. scientists have begun looking north for signs of what’s to come. Within a few days of assuming office, Trump unveiled a raft of measures that could affect how research in this country is funded and communicated to the public, including a directive that would require new studies to undergo political review before being released. Trump’s staffing of the Environmental Protection Agency—he has nominated Scott Pruitt, the Oklahoma Attorney General and a climate skeptic, to lead the agency, and has assigned advisers critical of environmental regulation to the E.P.A. transition team—suggests that he plans to make good on his campaign threat to “get rid of it in almost every form.” (Pruitt is expected to be confirmed as the E.P.A. administrator soon.) Meanwhile, a memo leaked to the press indicates that Trump has imposed a gag order on E.P.A. employees, preventing them from speaking with journalists, posting on social media, or sending out news releases. Past Presidents, including Barack Obama, have issued similar orders, but theirs tended to be limited in scope. Trump’s is comprehensive—much like Harper’s.\n\nThe muzzling of Canadian scientists coincided with a critical moment in Stirling’s work. Owing to a canny public-relations campaign by environmentalists in the United States, who hoped to pressure the Bush Administration into action on global warming, polar bears had suddenly become the poster children for climate catastrophe. (In May, 2007, the late celebrity cub Knut was even Photoshopped onto the cover of Vanity Fair, alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in crampons on an ice sheet.) Now, instead of chatting genially with a science reporter about, say, the effects of forest fires on polar-bear maternity, Stirling was obliged to give his would-be interviewer an 800 number for a communications officer in Ottawa, who would ask the journalist to submit questions. The press liaison would then send those questions to Stirling, who would write down his answers and send them back to Ottawa, to be relayed once again to the reporter. The process could take weeks, and often the liaison—someone with “no knowledge whatsoever about the field,” Stirling said—would nix certain answers. “That was just indefensible,” he told me.\n\nBearded, grandfatherly, and occasionally photographed cradling baby polar bears in his arms, Stirling is hardly the sort of person whose statements would typically invite attention at the ministerial level. Yet, in the Harper era, any research connected with human-caused climate change—melting ice in the Arctic, for instance—attracted particular scrutiny. “They didn’t like polar bears because the situation with them is so simple and straightforward,” Stirling said. “Even when I go to elementary schools, the kids understand that polar bears need ice to walk around on.” Several colleagues in the federal government were assigned media minders when they attended academic conferences. “That’s the sort of thing that should never happen in a democratic country,” he said. “I had seen this kind of thing before, in the seventies, when Russian scientists were in Canada with K.G.B. guys standing in the back of the room, scowling.” After thirty-seven years studying polar bears and ice-breeding seals on behalf of the Canadian Wildlife Service, Stirling felt philosophically out of step with the new government. In July, 2007, shortly before his sixty-sixth birthday, he retired. Since then, he has continued to make trips to the Arctic and to publish papers from his perch as an adjunct professor at the University of Alberta.\n\nThe Harper government’s paranoia, however, went beyond climate change. According to a study conducted in 2013 by the Professional Institute of the Public Service of Canada, one of the country’s largest labor unions, thirty-seven per cent of Canadian federal scientists, working in diverse fields, said that they had been “prevented in the past five years from responding to questions from the public and media.” Kristi Miller-Saunders, a twenty-five-year veteran of Fisheries and Oceans Canada, where she is the head of molecular genetics, got caught in Harper’s crosshairs when her data suggested that an infectious disease might be undermining performance in wild salmon. At a judicial inquiry in British Columbia, in 2011, she told me, “The government sent me in with a security officer—a bodyguard—because they wanted to keep the media from me. I wasn’t allowed to come in the main doors.” There was concern, Miller-Saunders said, that the public might attribute the sickness she had pinpointed to salmon farming, a major industry in Canada, even though her paper contained no mention of aquaculture. Rather ironically, she said, the government’s attempt at censorship “generated more interest” than the data warranted.\n\nThe Canadian scientists I spoke with were careful to point out that the Harper government never interfered with their research in the way that the Trump Administration seems to be planning to do with the E.P.A. Harper did, however, energetically defund and suppress federal ecological research, and he scrapped many environmental regulations that he thought might impede growth in the oil and gas industries. Thousands of government scientists lost their jobs as a result. At the same time, there was a marked drop in coverage of scientific news generally, and an eighty-per-cent decrease in climate-change coverage in particular, according to a government report released in 2010. “When you silence an organization, what they are doing is out of the public eye,” Miller-Saunders said. “People conclude there’s not good science going on. Once you lose credibility, it’s easy to go and cut programs.”\n\nUltimately, the media crackdown and subsequent gutting of programs led to a brain drain. “We lost brilliant people who went to other countries to do their work,” May said. Thomas Pedersen, the chair of the Canadian Climate Forum, told me that he has already been approached by one senior American scientist who is considering leaving the United States for Canada. “Why would you want to be slowed down by some bureaucratic wrangle that is a result of perverse, anti-science ideology?” he said. “It’s usually the crème de la crème of scientists who will say, ‘I don’t need to put up with this stuff.’ ”\n\nIn the United States, the spectre of a brain drain was recently made more real by the Trump Administration’s de-facto ban on immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries, which will obstruct the flow of, and appeal for, talented scientists and students from abroad. Visas issued to people in the affected countries were cancelled by the State Department after Trump’s executive order, which has been temporarily stayed by a federal judge in Seattle and is the focus of a fierce legal battle likely to reach the Supreme Court. It is doubtful that any international science organizations would risk holding a conference here now, or that the affected visa holders will feel comfortable attending professional events or visiting family outside the country, lest they be barred from reëntering. Last week, a photograph of a doctor named Mazin Khalid went viral. Khalid, who went to medical school in Sudan, is shown in a linoleum-floored corridor at Brooklyn’s Interfaith Medical Center, holding a sign that reads, “I am taking care of your mom . . . but I can’t go see mine.”\n\nIf the Canadian experience can teach U.S. scientists anything, it’s that not only their future research but also their past work is at risk. “Watch your libraries,” May said. “Stuff was taken away in dumpsters. Raw data and archives were lost.” There is enough collective anxiety about U.S. climate data being destroyed, altered, or lost that several groups of concerned citizens spent the months before Trump’s Inauguration copying federal data and moving it to other servers. “Within weeks of Harper becoming Canada’s Prime Minster, the climate-change information was scrubbed from the Web site of Environment Canada and researchers were muzzled,” May said. “That took weeks. Trump is a lot faster.”",
  "latent_15414": "One hundred and twenty five kilometers from Riga on the Vidzeme highway, just before the turning for the town of Smiltene is the little 'Jautrais ods' ('Merry mosquito') cafe. The food there is good, fresh and cheap.\n\nIn the cafe car park is an information board displaying the various tourist attractions of the surrounding area. This contains many of the usual things one sees on such boards in Latvia: manor houses, guest houses, parks, nature trails and places to swim, ride horses or camp. Each comes with a brief description.\n\nAmong this list is one attraction that immediately arrests the attention for the simple reason that it lacks any supplementary information at all. \"Colourful pole\" GPS [X: 617279, Y:6353993] is all it is willing to reveal. An accompanying map shows the location of said \"Colourful pole\" to be in remote forest about 9 kilometers south of where you are standing. It is irresistible.\n\nLocation of colourful pole\n\nDuring the journey from the cafe in the direction of the \"Colourful pole\" (We shall stick with the UK spelling on the info board) , the mind conjures up all sorts of images of what a \"colourful pole\" might be. If the information board is to be taken at face value, it will be a pole of some sort, colourful in character and worthy of being recorded on a map of regional tourist attractions.\n\nBanishing the cheap pun that suggests it might be no more than a flamboyant visitor from Warsaw, a natural assumption would be that it is a maypole bedecked with ribbons, around which local maidens frolic during springtime. This idyllic vision becomes a little more sinister as the forest thickens and darkens, and you remember the map showed that the road actually ends at the very location of the \"Colourful pole\". Thoughts turn to The Wicker Man and the fact you didn't tell anyone where you were going or what time you expected to return.\n\nYet perhaps this \"Colourful pole\" is a soaring antenna that flashes an iridescent bronze in the rays of the setting sun and can be seen for many a mile? Or a large-scale art installation by a reclusive genius who lives somewhere nearby in a remote woodland studio? A relic of the Soviet era, part of an abandoned array from their nuclear warning system? Excitement mounts as you see the roadsign telling you of the imminent disappearance of the asphalted surface. The \"Colourful pole\" must be somewhere hereabouts, peering over the tops of the lofty trees! How tall? How thick? Above all, how colourful?\n\nIs that it?!\n\nThere to your left, standing somewhat sheepishly in the shadows is what - in the absence of any other candidates - must be the \"Colourful pole.\"\n\nTo give credit where it is due, it is certainly a pole or, to be more precise, a post. To be more precise still, it is a signpost.\n\nAs regards its make-or-break claim to be \"colourful\", that is perhaps legally accurate but fans of colours other than red, white and black (two of which pedants might not consider to be true colours) may be disappointed by the restricted range of hues on offer. The first thing that springs to mind is a barber's pole.\n\nProviding some solace for the less-than-spectacular initial impression made by the pole, it does at least offer up some consolatory information in the form of distances to two highways and two places of human habitation you're probably not particularly interested in visiting unless you live there - in which case you already know the way and how far it is.\n\nYet around the Colourful pole's base are neatly tended flowers. There's a tiny wooden bridge to lift you over what might become a tiny puddle on a wet day which allows you to inspect the Colourful pole up close. It looks exactly as it does from far away i.e. a signpost.\n\nHowever, retracing one's steps and taking stock of the Colourful pole a final time, it suddenly makes sense. There is no gift shop, no admission fee, no coach party sniffing through the grass verge, no electronic shutter click and no Instagram filter being applied. The information board 9 kilometers to the north told you to expect a \"Colourful pole\". You are looking at a Colourful pole; a neat, tidy little signpost where the road runs out, with forest all around, wild strawberries for the picking, birds having dust-baths in three tracks to nowhere and the quietness that comes from being a long way from the highway.\n\nYou may not know why, but you do know where: [X: 617279, Y:6353993] to be precise.",

If you’re not satisfied, your relationship is going to suffer. I assume you’ve talked to your guy about this, but if you haven’t, DO. Just make sure you approach it with a focus upon what he’s doing or done right, not what’s going wrong.

By the time you get home, you won’t be tired.\n\nSame goes for if he gets home after you; think deeply about what you will do to him when he walks in the door. I don’t care how tired he is when he arrives, if he’s greeted by you, barely buttoned and biting your lip, things are going to happen! After a few days of this, you’ll get turned on merely by the sound of his car in the driveway.\n\nIf, after this, things aren’t up to your speed, write us back… The guy who truly doesn’t want to have sex with his girl is a whole other can of worms.\n\n♦◊♦\n\nHe Said: Do you have a date book?

If you’ve already discussed it (and chances are you both want more sex), then the secret’s already out. Swallow your pride, and start scheduling your sex.

  "latent_15642": "AccuWeather chief executive Barry Myers testifies at a House Science Committeee Hearing, June 8, 2016.\n\n(This story has been updated.)\n\nBarry Myers, the chief executive of the private weather forecasting company AccuWeather, is President Trump’s pick to run the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\n\nThe appointment of Myers, a businessman and lawyer, breaks from the recent precedent of scientists leading the agency tasked with a large, complex and technically demanding portfolio. Every past NOAA administrator but one, attorney Richard Frank who served from 1977-1981, held science degrees.\n\nThe agency oversees the National Weather Service, conducts and funds weather and climate research, and operates a constellation of weather satellites as well as a climate data center. It also has critical responsibilities in monitoring and protecting the nation’s coasts, oceans and fisheries.\n\nMyers’s supporters say he brings valuable experience from the private sector that will help NOAA advance its capabilities.\n\n“[I]n an Administration that places high value on business acumen, Barry brings a strong track record in growing one of the most successful companies in the weather industry,” said Ray Ban, co-chair of the Weather Coalition, an advocacy group for strengthening America’s weather industry across sectors.\n\nVice Adm. Conrad Lautenbacher, NOAA administrator under George W. Bush, said Myers is an “ideal fit” for the position. “Barry brings with him an outstanding record as a leader and manager as well as many years of experience in all aspects of meteorology,” he said.\n\nBut others are concerned about his potential conflicts of interest and lack of science background.\n\nAs NOAA administrator, Myers would be in charge of the Weather Service whose data are heavily used by his family business, based in State College, Pa.\n\nAccuWeather has, in the past, supported measures to limit the extent to which the Weather Service can release information to the public, so that private companies could generate their own value-added products using this same information. In 2005, for example, Myers and his brother Joel gave money to then-Sen. Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who introduced legislation aimed at curtailing government competition with private weather services.\n\n“Barry Myers defines ‘conflict of interest,'” said Ciaran Clayton, who was communications director at NOAA in the Obama administration. “He actively lobbied to privatize the National Weather Service, which works day in and day out to protect the lives and livelihoods of millions of Americans, to benefit his own company’s bottom line.”\n\nMyers’s appointment is strongly opposed by the labor union for the National Weather Service, the NWS Employees Organization, for this same reason. “As NOAA administrator, he would be in a position to fundamentally alter the nature of weather services that NOAA provides the nation, to the benefit of his family-owned business,” said Richard Hirn, a spokesperson for the union.\n\nSen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) called Myers a “questionable choice” to lead NOAA. “Mr. Myers will have to work very hard to persuade me that he will run NOAA for the public good,” Schatz said. “[H]e will also need to explain why his service as NOAA Administrator will not violate conflict of interest rules and regulations.”\n\nSen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.) expressed a similar sentiment. “We can’t afford to have someone in this position that might be tempted to feather their own nest by privatizing the National Weather Service,” he said.\n\nIn January, when he was first rumored to be a candidate for administrator, Myers expressed strong support for the Weather Service and its mission. He has a long history of working with the Weather Service, having advised five directors, according to his biography, and won an award from the American Meteorological Society for “fostering strong cooperation between private sector and government weather services” in 2014.\n\nHis supporters believe he will be able to apply his business savvy to help NOAA better leverage assets in the commercial sector.\n\n“Myers will bring that Big Data acumen to NOAA and likely accelerate a process that has slowly been underway: more private-sector collaboration with satellite data, weather models and other information services,” said Ryan Maue, a weather model product developer for Weather.us, in an interview with the Associated Press.\n\nRichard Spinrad, NOAA’s chief scientist in the Obama administration, expressed some reservations about Myers’s lack of science background but said his business background “could serve him well” since NOAA is housed in the Department of Commerce. Spinrad said Myers can position himself to succeed if he is able “to bolster his leadership team with scientifically competent, and technically experienced experts.”\n\nWhile very familiar with challenges facing the weather industry, Myers lack of experience managing ocean issues has emerged as a particular concern. “If confirmed, it will be [Myers’] duty to champion all facets of NOAA from the deep sea to outer space. Myers has had nearly forty years in the private weather industry but the stakes at NOAA are different,” said Janis Searles Jones, CEO of the Ocean Conservancy.\n\nPerhaps allaying such concerns, some scientific leadership is already in place to help Myers navigate challenging oceanic and atmospheric issues. In recent weeks, Trump announced selections for two deputies to support the NOAA administrator: former Navy oceanographer Rear. Adm. Timothy Gallaudet and Neil Jacobs, chief atmospheric scientist at Panasonic Avionics Corporation.\n\nGallaudet’s confirmation sailed through the Senate and reactions to his appointment have been glowing, including from officials of the previous administration.\n\n“[Gallaudet] has a proven track record of outstanding service, and is a terrific nominee,” said Jane Lubchenco, who headed NOAA during President Barack Obama’s first term, in an email.\n\nNews releases from the Consortium for Ocean Leadership and University Corporation for Atmospheric Research, a consortium of academic institutions, focused on scientific research, also lauded Gallaudet’s expertise and record of service.\n\n“Mr. Myers’ knowledge of the weather and climate enterprise will be complemented by Admiral Gallaudet’s extensive scientific and operational expertise in oceanography and meteorology,” said Rear. Adm. (Ret.) Jonathan White, president of the Consortium for Ocean Leadership.\n\nJacobs, the second deputy, is best known for developing a weather forecast model at Panasonic that has, at times, outperformed the National Weather Service’s main model.\n\n[The best forecasts for Hurricane Irma came from a computer model few people know about]\n\nJacobs could help Myers in improving NOAA’s weather forecast modeling, integrating private sector knowledge and methods.\n\n“From my years of working with Barry, I know he appreciates the importance of re-establishing U.S. preeminence in weather prediction,” said Antonio Busalacchi, president of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research. Busalacchi has supported Myers ever since he emerged as the front-runner for the NOAA job in May.\n\nEven with the prospect of Myers advancing NOAA’s technology, some are still uncomfortable with a businessman running an agency whose mission is public service-focused.\n\n“The tendency to place corporate leaders in charge of public agencies is ill-advised because the measure of success do not translate well from private organizations to public institutions,” said Susan Jasko, an expert in communication theory specializing in weather at California University of Pennsylvania.\n\nAndrew Rosenberg of the Union of Concerned Scientists and former NOAA scientist wrote in a blog post: “Some say that bringing a business approach to government is essential. I am not one of them.”\n\nLubchenco put the task in front of Myers this way: “The new NOAA administrator must be a strong champion for and steward of all of NOAA — its integrated mission of science, services, and stewardship. This means nurturing its research, climate, weather, ships and planes, satellites, ocean and coasts, fisheries, sanctuaries, trust resources, and other units. If some of these units wither, the ability of the others to function well is compromised. Strong science underpins both the service and the stewardship functions.”\n\nOne of the big unknowns about Myers is his position on climate change. He has made no known public statements on the politically charged issue.\n\nAccuWeather’s stated position on climate change, while not inconsistent with existing scientific assessments, is vague. “Global climate change is a matter of intense concern and public importance,” it begins. “There can be little doubt that human beings influence the world’s climate. At the same time, our knowledge of the extent, progress, mechanisms and results of global climate change is still incomplete.”\n\nMarshall Shepherd, a past president of the American Meteorological Society, said he is willing to give Myers “the benefit of the doubt” if he is “a stronger leader on climate change and an advocate for the National Weather Service.”\n\nThe jury is out.",
  "latent_15692": "47 Pages Posted: 22 Nov 2015 Last revised: 17 Nov 2017\n\nDate Written: November 20, 2015\n\nAbstract\n\nScholars have examined the lawmakers’ choice between rules and standards for decades. This paper, however, explores the possibility of a new form of law that renders that choice unnecessary. Advances in technology (such as big data and artificial intelligence) will give rise to this new form – the micro-directive – which will provide the benefits of both rules and standards without the costs of either.\n\nLawmakers will be able to use predictive and communication technologies to enact complex legislative goals that are translated by machines into a vast catalog of simple commands for all possible scenarios. When an individual citizen faces a legal choice, the machine will select from the catalog and communicate to that individual the precise context-specific command (the micro-directive) necessary for compliance. In this way, law will be able to adapt to a wide array of situations and direct precise citizen behavior without further legislative or judicial action. A micro-directive, like a rule, provides a clear instruction to a citizen on how to comply with the law. But, like a standard, a micro-directive is tailored to and adapts to each and every context.\n\nWhile predictive technologies such as big data have already introduced a trend toward personalized default rules, in this paper we suggest that this is only a small part of a larger trend toward context-specific laws that can adapt to any situation. As that trend continues, the fundamental cost trade-off between rules and standards will disappear, changing the way society structures and thinks about law.",
  "latent_15785": "Sony's Shuhei Yoshida has 3 PSN IDs. Do you?\n\nDo you have multiple PlayStation Network IDs so you can access the PlayStation Store in different countries?\n\nLots of PlayStation 3 owners do. And so does Sony worldwide studios boss and avid gamer Shuhei Yoshida.\n\nOne of the most long-standing complaint against Sony's PlayStation Store set up is that the content differs by region. Because Sony Computer Entertainment divisions operate independently, what's released on the US Store may not be released on the European Store, and vice versa.\n\nSometimes content that appears on the US Store fails to turn up on the European Store in a timely fashion or not at all. Recent high-profile examples include the disparity between release dates for the superb Walking Dead series, Retro City Rampage, and the mysterious case of the missing-in-action Valve FPS Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.\n\nThere are a number of reasons for these delays. Sony's regional approach means games must be submitted to SCEA and SCEE separately. Each has their own QA and certification process and each signs their own contracts with publishers and developers. It means games can pass certification in the US and fail in Europe, for whatever reason.\n\nLocalisation often causes delays, too. Europe suffers here, because of the sheer number of languages that must be dealt with. But Sony fans point to Microsoft and Xbox Live Arcade, which does not appear to suffer similar issues. Microsoft's global system means games almost always launch day and date in the US and Europe.\n\nYoshida, who has impressed PlayStation fans with his honest approach to interviews and willingness to engage fans on Twitter, took to the comments section of the PlayStation Blog to answer concern on this subject from gamers.\n\n\"In light of ever-increasing globalization of the (gaming) world, do you see a future for the current regionalized approach to digital distribution, or do you anticipate one global distribution network (including one PS Store, a global SEN account etc)?\" asked chrisboers. \"I understand there are (legal and contractual) regional restrictions right now, but in five years maybe? Is this something Sony actively pursues?\"\n\n\"It's a great question!\" Yoshida replied. \"There are both positives and negatives in the current regional approach, and I admit I have 3 PSN IDs for Japan, US and Europe...\"\n\nThen, in response to Skookie30's questions on the subject (including \"Why do you need to use the so called unfair muti-region system that 5 years EU haven't got the same love as SCEA & SCEJ when it comes to content?\"), Yoshida suggested gamers be careful what they wish for.\n\n\"Managing multiple small countries with multiple languages is much more inefficient than managing a large single country,\" he said. \"You should be careful what you wish for.

(Photo Courtesy Marathon Oil) Here's an aerial view of a Marathon Oil drilling rig in the Eagle Ford. (Photo Courtesy Marathon Oil) Image 1 of / 4 Caption Close Texas is on its way to being 'Saudi Texas' 1 / 4 Back to Gallery\n\nThe Lone Star State is earning a new moniker: Saudi Texas.\n\nOil production in Texas is soaring, so much so that production jumped to an average 2.139 million barrels a day in November — the best showing in more than 25 years.\n\nAnalysts are chalking up Texas' booming production to shale plays, especially South Texas' Eagle Ford Shale where production was minuscule just five years ago, along with a revival of West Texas' Permian Basin.\n\nAnalysts are tossing around the words “phenomenal,” “amazing” and “unprecedented” when discussing the numbers.\n\nSince production began in the Eagle Ford Shale, the state's oil output has doubled and Texas' share of domestic oil output “has reached new all-time record high levels,” said Mark J. Perry, a professor of economics and finance at the University of Michigan-Flint and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C.\n\nTexas' oil production has jumped by 71 percent in the last two years, Perry said, based on data from the Energy Information Administration, the Energy Department's statistics arm.\n\n“It's a huge, unbelievable increase,” said Perry, who has used the term “Saudi Texas” in his blog, called Carpe Diem. “It's amazing how fast it has happened. It's just phenomenal.”\n\nTo put Texas' oil production in perspective, Perry compared it to North Dakota, the nation's No. 2 oil-producing state. In November, Texas produced almost three times as much oil as North Dakota, home to the productive Bakken Shale.\n\nTexas logged a 654,000-barrel-a-day increase in oil production in a 15-month period ending in November. “That's like adding another Bakken formation to the U.S. oil supply,” Perry said.\n\nAnd the Permian Basin, once thought to be nearly played out, has reclaimed its status as a strong contributor to the state's production, experts said.\n\nAnalysts credit the oil boom in Texas and across the country to improvements in horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracturing. Improvements in efficiency are helping, too.\n\nThe oil boom “has significant implications — both in terms of the economic base for jobs and employment and for the revenue base of state government,” said Bruce Bullock, director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University's Cox School of Business in Dallas.\n\nTexas is benefiting from the high salaries paid to workers in oil- and gas-related industries, whose annual pay averaged $112,000 in 2011, more than twice the average of $47,000 for all Texas workers, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.\n\nOil and gas workers represent just 4 percent of all workers in the state, but “when you have a salary that's approaching three times the average, that shows you the impact on the state's economy,” Bullock said.\n\nAlso, oil-field-related jobs have a relatively high multiplier effect, creating four jobs for every petroleum-related one. That doesn't even count service jobs, such as restaurant employment, created to handle oil-field workers, he said.\n\nSeverance taxes — Texas' tax on oil and gas production — “are back up as a significant source of revenue,” Bullock said, as well as local property taxes.\n\nOil and gas deposits in the state's rainy day fund were almost $1.9 billion in fiscal 2013 — representing almost one-fourth of the fund's $8 billion. They're estimated to be $1.7 billion in fiscal 2014 and $1.8 billion 2015.\n\n(While oil and gas contributions to the fund have fluctuated, this year's contribution dwarfs 2011's deposit of $451 million. Eagle Ford production was just starting to make an impact that year.)\n\nWhether the state can get a firm grip on the “Saudi Texas” handle is a matter of dispute. Experts differ on the expected longevity of Texas' black gold boom.\n\nTexas comptroller Susan Combs noted last month that the “continued lack of vitality” in major world economies “will ultimately affect Texas ... regardless of how salutary the current oil and natural gas related activity is to our state.”\n\nSMU's Bullock, though, is optimistic that oil prices will remain relatively high and that will continue to encourage drilling.\n\n“Prices will go up and down for oil, but as long as the world economy maintains some modicum of growth in China and India and other developing countries, oil prices aren't going to dip too far.”\n\nThe Dallas-based petroleum consulting firm, Turner, Mason & Co., noted in a report last week that the “shale oil revolution is accelerating.” More crude oil is being tapped than was projected just a year ago, the firm said.\n\nSenior consultant John Mayes at Turner, Mason said the general expectation is that shale plays such as the Eagle Ford won't be as productive for as long as reservoirs like the Permian Basin have been.\n\nYet the Eagle Ford's production is expected to last “a couple of decades more,” he said. “And remember that the way technology evolves, the life of the field could extend longer than originally anticipated.”\n\nvvaughan@express-news.net",

Richard Durbin (D-IL), Sen. John McCain (R-AZ), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Sen. Charles Schumer (D-NY) still used the phrase “illegal immigrant” at a press conference Monday touting their plan.\n\nAlso, McCain did not correct Fox News host Eric Bolling when he used the word “illegals” during a separate interview on Monday.\n\nThe memo also contained tips on criticizing President Barack Obama on his own immigration reform, which he is scheduled to reveal Tuesday afternoon.\n\n“Do acknowledge that President Obama broke his promise and failed to propose any immigration reform for five years, while using this issue as a political wedge,” it said.\n\nHowever, Obama was pushing for such reforms as recently as two years ago, accusing Republicans of “moving the goal posts” on the issue. In the wake of the defeat of the DREAM Act, Obama also authorized a two-year deferred-deportation program for younger immigrants last year.\n\nColorlines also pointed out that another lawmaker behind this week’s bipartisan plan, Sen. Jeff Flake (R-AZ), seemed to follow a more concilatory line of thinking in an interview with PBS host Gwen Ifill Monday.\n\n“I think you’ll see a different tone all the way around,” Flake said. “I’m from ground zero in this issue in Arizona and you’ve seen a different tone in the last year or so and you’ll continue to see a different tone moving ahead across the entire country.”\n\nWatch Flake’s remarks to Ifill, posted online on Tuesday by Colorlines’ Jorge Rivas, below.",

  "latent_16135": "(CNN) Gavin Long, the man who killed three law enforcement officers in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, before a SWAT team officer shot him dead -- told friends and relatives that he suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, a source involved in the investigation told CNN's Chris Cuomo.\n\nLong joined the Marine Corps in 2005, worked as a data network specialist and served in Iraq before being discharged as a sergeant in 2010, according to the U.S. military.\n\nLong had filled a prescription for Ativan, an anti-anxiety drug, as recently as June, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. He also had prescriptions for Valium and the sleep aid Lunesta, the source said.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear whether anyone had diagnosed him with PTSD.\n\nCNN has filed a Freedom of Information Act request with the military to obtain records about Long's service. Under Defense Department rules, health records that might include any information on Long's mental health are considered protected, even though he is dead. The records are part of the criminal investigation.\n\nValium, like Ativan, is a benzodiazepine -- a class of medication with sedative properties that are prescribed for anxiety, insomnia and other conditions.\n\nSymptoms of PTSD can include, but are not limited to, feelings of anxiety, insomnia and nightmares.\n\nSunday's ambush of police by Long, a 29-year-old black man, came nearly two weeks after a police officer shot and killed Alton Sterling, a black Baton Rouge resident, outside a convenience store in the city on July 5.\n\nGunman advocated 'fighting back'\n\nof Kansas City, Missouri, stalked Baton Rouge officers on Sunday before shooting six officers in an ambush, Police say Long,of Kansas City, Missouri, stalked Baton Rouge officers on Sunday before shooting six officers in an ambush, killing three -- Baton Rouge police Officers Montrell Jackson and Matthew Gerald and East Baton Rouge sheriff's Deputy Brad Garafola -- and wounding three others.\n\nA SWAT team rifleman subsequently shot and killed Long with a shot from 100 yards, police said.\n\n\"There is no doubt whatsoever that these officers were targeted and assassinated,\" Louisiana State Police Col. Michael D. Edmonson said Monday.\n\nOne of the three injured officers, Deputy Nicholas Tullier, was critically wounded and \"fighting for his life,\" Sheriff Sid Gautreaux said Sunday.\n\nEdmonson told CNN on Wednesday that Long was seen \"riding around\" the area in the days before the attack. The shooter stayed at several locations, according to Edmonson. State police have interviewed people who interacted with Long.\n\nLong apparently visited Dallas after the shootings there, posting a YouTube video July 10 in which he said he was in the Texas city and spoke of the recent protests and officer-involved shootings.\n\nIn the video, Long mentions the July Fourth holiday as a celebration of an uprising against oppressive forces. Without mentioning Micah Xavier Johnson -- the Dallas shooter -- by name, he questions why some violent actions are perceived as criminal while others are celebrated.\n\nHe also said that victims of bullying need to resort to brute force.\n\n\"One hundred percent have been successful through fighting back. Through bloodshed,\" he said in the video. \"Zero have been successful just over simply protesting. It has never worked, and it never will.\"\n\nIn another video, Long is in Baton Rouge driving around with a man he apparently recently met and offering people copies of a self-published self-help book. Long talks almost the entire time, lecturing one young man about life, telling him to develop multiple job skills and not strictly depend on income from his rapping. Long also tells him not to trust people of other races.\n\nHe says if he had been there when Sterling was killed he would have done something.\n\nLong left a trail of writings, videos and social media posts describing his thoughts, ideas and worldview under the pseudonym Cosmo Setepenra. He legally changed his name to Setepenra last year.\n\nLong rented a car in Kansas City after the Dallas shootings and eventually drove it to Baton Rouge, two law enforcement sources told CNN.\n\nCarl Woodley, Long's stepfather, said he was in \"total shock\" about the Baton Rouge shootings. He said he was sorry about what happened to the officers and about losing his stepson.\n\nWoodley said Long was about 7 when they met and he remembered him as a good, quiet and intelligent boy.\n\n\"I never had ... problems with him,\" he said. \"He wasn't my biological son, but he was a son to me. ... We were real close.\"\n\nLong never talked to him about anger toward the police or the way they treated blacks, said Woodley, who added he never saw his stepson with a weapon.\n\nBaton Rouge, Dallas shooters were military veterans\n\nDuring his five years in the Marine Corps, Long served in Iraq from June 2008 to January 2009, and also spent some time in California and Japan.\n\nHe received a handful of awards, including the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal.\n\nA research report on the department's website says that \"although PTSD is associated with a risk of violence, most people with PTSD have never engaged in violence.\"\n\nLike Long, Dallas shooter Johnson had military ties, having been an Army reservist. Dallas police Chief David Brown said Johnson, a black man, had expressed that he was upset about recent police shootings, wanted to kill white people and white police officers, and \"expressed anger for Black Lives Matter.\"\n\nJohnson was killed by a bomb delivered by a police robot on the night of the Dallas attack after failed negotiations, police said.\n\nIn an interview this month with The Blaze , Johnson's parents and stepmother said he changed after military service, which included deployment to Afghanistan from late 2013 to mid-2014. Before joining the military, he'd wanted to become a police officer, said his mother, Delphine Johnson.\n\n\"The military was not what Micah thought it would be,\" she said. \"He was very disappointed, very disappointed. But it may be that the ideal that he thought of our government, what he thought the military represented, it just didn't live up to his expectations.\"",
  "latent_16162": "Many have now heard rumblings of the “amero”, a proposed North American currency to replace the Canadian loonie, dollar and peso. However, most of the mentions of this concept, when discussed in the mainstream media tend to focus on suggesting that talk of an “amero”, and in effect, the accompanying North American Union, is nothing but a conspiracy theory created by deluded xenophobes afraid of immigration and globalization. The Boston Globe recently wrote such a story, titled, “The Amero Conspiracy”, which stated, “The SPP [Security and Prosperity Partnership] does exist, and its tri-national task forces continue to meet, but its members consider it a way for the United States, Canada, and Mexico to collaborate on issues such as customs, environmental and safety regulations, narcotics smuggling, and terrorism. The amero, on the other hand, appears to be purely theoretical.”1\n\nHowever, despite being conveyed as “purely theoretical”, a recent article in the national Canadian newspaper, the Financial Post, referred to the amero, not as a theoretical idea or conspiracy theory, but as a potential reality. The article entitled, Fix the Loonie, lays out the process to be undertaken before the adoption of a continental currency known as the Amero.\n\nThe article was written as a response to a previous article written in defense of Canada’s flexible exchange rate system, to which it states, “David Laidler's recent defence of Canada's flexible exchange rate system misses completely the point made by Nobel Prize winning economist Robert Mundell in his famous article on optimum currency areas. Mundell's article has been widely credited with providing the intellectual base for the European Monetary Union and merits attention.”2 The article continued elaborating on the previous point made by Mundell, stating, “If flexible exchange rates are best for Canada on the grounds presented by Laidler, why would flexible rates not be best also for Alberta, Ontario or New Brunswick?” It continued, “Milton Friedman's response to Mundell was that he would not advocate flexible rates for every possible region.”\n\nThe article contends that Canada is currently suffering from what the author refers to as the ‘Dutch Disease’, “which is named after the problems that developed in the 1960s when the Netherlands sold natural gas that had been discovered on its coast. The increases in Dutch exports of resources, like those of Canada in recent years, resulted in a strong appreciation of exchange rates, which was reinforced by interest rate policies of central banks and currency speculators.” It further states that, “The disease manifests itself through the loss of domestic manufacturers' ability to compete abroad and with imports.” The author then contends that, “The disease manifests itself through the loss of domestic manufacturers' ability to compete abroad and with imports,” and that, “The Bank of Canada can keep interest rates low to discourage capital inflows and thus exchange rate increases, but at the cost of fuelling inflationary pressures.”\n\nThe author then states that there is only one true cure for Canada’s ‘Dutch Disease’, “inoculation of the system by fixing the exchange rate at a level that allows manufacturers to be competitive, perhaps at the rate the Bank of Canada research identifies as the long-run equilibrium, around US90¢.” The author goes on to explain the reasoning behind this by giving the example that, “The Netherlands and Austria in the years before the introduction of the euro successfully operated such a system and enjoyed near perfectly stable exchange rates against the German currency. The essential ingredient in this success was the official commitment of the central banks of these two countries to maintain the same interest rate as that of the German central bank.”\n\nSo if Canada were to do the same in relation to the US dollar, then Canadian interest rates would be subject to the rates set by the US Federal Reserve, with our Bank of Canada lock in step. The author goes on to say, “An analogous commitment by the Bank of Canada with respect to U.S. interest rates may not be credible, tested by speculators and therefore ultimately doomed to failure.” Then the article continues, and makes a startling announcement:\n\n“However, there is a solution to this lack of credibility. In Europe, it came through the creation of the euro and formal end of the ability of national central banks to set interest rates. The analogous creation of the amero is not possible without the unlikely co-operation of the United States.\n\nThis leaves the credibility issue to be solved by the unilateral adoption of a currency board, which would ensure that international payments imbalances automatically lead to changes in Canada's money supply and interest rates until the imbalances are ended, all without any actions by the Bank of Canada or influence by politicians.\n\nIt would be desirable to create simultaneously the currency board and a New Canadian Dollar valued at par with the U.S. dollar. With longer-run competitiveness assured at US90¢ to the U.S. dollar. [Emphasis added].”\n\nIn summation, what the author is proposing is to fix the Canadian loonie to the US dollar at US$0.90, create a currency board, which would be an unelected, unaccountable, group of people to handle our monetary policy, creating a route around using the publicly owned Bank of Canada, to ensure the creation of a ‘New Canadian Dollar’, which would be a prelude to the Amero. The author then explains that, “Fluctuations in global demand for natural resources will always result in competition for labour and capital among Canadian manufacturers and producers of resources. But, at least, the firms in these sectors would no longer have to concern themselves with exchange-rate fluctuations and policies of the Bank of Canada.” The article finishes by stating, “There will also always be changes in the U.S. (and Canadian) dollar exchange rate against the euro and other major currencies. But these changes would have minor effects on the Canadian economy because 80% of the country's trade is with the United States.”\n\nThe author of this article is Herbert Grubel, a professor of economics emeritus at Simon Fraser University, who also happens to be a Senior Fellow at the Fraser Institute, one of Canada’s largest and most prominent pro-big business think tanks.3 Other senior fellows at the Fraser Institute include Eugene Beaulieu, who sits on the Academic Advisory Council to the Deputy Minister of International Trade in the Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade for the Government of Canada, Martin Collacott, former Canadian Ambassador, Tom Flanagan, ho is known as the “man behind Stephen Harper”, and is a member of what is known as the ‘Calgary School’, which is an unofficial group of like minded thinkers who espouse neo-conservative views, and hold significant influence in the current Conservative government, even referring to Flanagan as the “Godfather of Canada’s conservative movement.”4\n\nFlanagan also used to work for Preston Manning, who is also a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, a former Member of Parliament, and former leader of the opposition, and other senior fellows include Gordon Gibson, a former Assistant to the Minister of Northern Affairs and later Special Assistant to the Prime Minister, Wilf Gobert, former Director and Vice Chairman of Peters & Co. Limited, “an independent, fully integrated investment firm which has specialized for 35 years in investments in the Canadian oil, natural gas, and oilfield services industries,” Michael Harris, former Conservative Premier of Ontario, Jerry Jordan, former President and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, Ralph Klein, former Premier of Alberta, Rainer Knopff, a professor and also a member of the ‘Calgary School’, and Brian Tobin, a former Industry Minister.5\n\nThe author of the Financial Post article which mentioned the amero, Herbert Grubel, wrote a paper for the Fraser Institute in 1999, entitled, “The Case for the Amero: The Economic and Politics of a North American Monetary Union”, in which he laid out the case for the creation of a regional currency for North America.6 In this paper, Grubel wrote that, “The plan for a North American Monetary Union presented in this study is designed to include Canada, the United States, and Mexcio,” and that, “The North American Central Bank, like the European Central Bank, will have a constitution making it responsible only for the maintenance of price stability and not for full employment.”7\n\nIn discussing the issue of sovereignty related to a monetary union, Grubel stated that he thinks that, “sovereignty is not infinitely valuable. The merit of giving up some aspects of sovereignty should be determined by the gains brought by such a sacrifice.”8 He continued in saying, “It is important to note that in practice Canada has given up its economic sovereignty in many areas, the most important of which involve the World Trade Organization (formerly the GATT), the North American Free Trade Agreement,” as well as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.9 Despite admitting to several agreements and organizations of which strip Canadian sovereignty, Grubel suggests that losing sovereignty in these areas is still worth the benefits.\n\nThe introduction of the Amero is an integral aspect of the process of creating a North American Union, much like the European Union. This process is being undertaken through the implementation of the Security and Prosperity Partnership of North America (SPP), which was signed by the leaders of the three North American governments in March of 2005. This agreement is orchestrating the bureaucratic “harmonization” among the three North American nations to pave the way for a North American Community, akin to the previous European Community, and ultimately, a North American Union.\n\nThe push for this agenda is being driven by the US-based Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), the preeminent American think tank, and the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, as well as the Mexican equivalent, Consejo Mexicano de Asuntos Internacionales. In May of 2005, the three groups, as a result of their joining forces in a Task Force, released a report entitled, “Building a North American Community,” in which they state that, “The Task Force offers a detailed and ambitious set of proposals that build on the recommendations adopted by the three governments at the Texas summit of March 2005. The Task Force’s central recommendation is establishment by 2010 of a North American economic and security community, the boundaries of which would be defined by a common external tariff, and an outer security perimeter.”10\n\nThomas P. D’Aquino was the Canadian Co-Chair of the Task Force report and is also the President and CEO of the Canadian Council of Chief Executives, other Canadian members of the Task Force report include Allan Gotleib, former Canadian Ambassador to the United States, Pierre Marc Johnson, former Premier of Quebec, John Manley, former Deputy Prime Minister of Canada, and after 9/11, negotiated the Smart Border Agreement with the US Secretary for Homeland Security Tom Ridge, and Wendy Dobson, former President of the C.D. Howe Institute, another one of Canada’s most prominent think tanks, and former Associate Deputy Minister of Finance in the Government of Canada.11\n\nThe C.D. Howe Institute has on its board of directors, individuals from Imperial Oil Canada, a subsidiary of Exxon Mobil, General Electric Canada, BMO Financial Group, TD Bank Financial Group, Nortel Networks, Manulife Financial, Bank of Nova Scotia, Enbridge Gas Distribution, EnCana Corporation, Ford Motor Company of Canada, HSBC Bank of Canada, Astral Media, Merrill Lynch Canada, CIBC World Markets, and N M Rothschild and Sons Canada.12\n\nIn 1999, the C.D. Howe Institute published a report entitled, From Fixing to Monetary Union: Options for North American Currency Integration.13 In the paper, it is argued that, “The easiest way to broach the notion of a NAMU [North American Monetary Union] is to view it as the North American equivalent of the European Monetary Union (EMU) and, by extension, the euro.”14 It continued in discussing the issue of sovereignty, stating, “That a NAMU would mean the end of sovereignty in Canadian monetary policy is clear. Most obviously, it would mean abandoning a made-in-Canada inflation rate for a US or NAMU inflation rate.”15\n\nThe concept of a North American currency has not only been the object of discussion within powerful big-business think tanks, but has, in fact, been discussed in government positions. In May of 2007, Canada’s then-Governor of the Bank of Canada, David Dodge, said that, “North America could one day embrace a euro-style single currency,” the Globe and Mail reported. Further, the article stated that, “Some proponents have dubbed the single North American currency the ‘amero’,” and further, “Answering questions from the audience after a speech in Chicago, Mr. Dodge said a single currency was ‘possible’.”16\n\nIn November of 2007, the Globe and Mail reported that, “Canada should replace its dollar with a North American currency, or peg it to the U.S. greenback, to avoid the exchange rate shifts the loonie has experienced, renowned money manager Stephen Jarislowsky told a parliamentary committee yesterday,” and quoted Jarislowsky as saying, “I think we have to really seriously start thinking of the model of a continental currency just like Europe.”17 The article continued, “Mr. Jarislowsky, a former Canfor Corp. director, said the loonie's rise to above par with the U.S. dollar is destroying manufacturing and could devastate the forest sector,” and that, “Mr. Jarislowsky said Canada could either aim for a common North American currency or peg the loonie to the U.S. greenback at about 80 cents (U.S.), allowing it to float within a small band.” Jarislowsky, a billionaire often considered to be Canada’s Warren Buffet, is a member of several corporate boards, and is also a member of the board of directors of the C.D. Howe Institute.18\n\nAppearing on Larry King Live recently, former Mexican President and initial signatory to the Security and Prosperity Partnership, Vicente Fox, when asked a question about whether or not it was possible to see a common currency for Latin America, responded by stating, “Long term, very long term. What we propose together, President Bush and myself, it's ALCA, which is a trade union for all of the Americas. And everything was running fluently until Hugo Chavez came. He decided to isolate himself. He decided to combat the idea and destroy the idea,” to which Larry King interjected, “It's going to be like the euro dollar, you mean?” and Fox responded, “Well, that would be long, long term. I think the processes to go, first step into is trading agreement. And then further on, a new vision, like we are trying to do with NAFTA.”19\n\nSo clearly, there is a move on toward a regional currency for North America, in conjunction with the formation of a North American Union. Monetary sovereignty, and especially the power to create and issue money, is perhaps more central to the idea of a free, democratic and sovereign nation than the right to vote. If we do not have the power over the issuance of money, it does not matter whom we vote for. It’s the Golden Rule: he who has the gold, makes the rules. We, as Canadians, and other peoples of their respective nations should never relinquish this sovereignty over to regional boards, private banks, or other unaccountable individuals. It is our right, not a privilege, and giving up such a right is akin to giving up the right to vote; it is anathema to democracy and a free society.\n\n1 Drake Bennett, The Amero Conspiracy.

  "latent_16246": "It's the end of September. My boyfriend and I are walking down Derrynane Beach in County Kerry when two things occur to us: 1) that we are completely alone; 2) that we are not going to see the ocean again in 2016. I roll up my jeans, waddle in and shriek with the cold. A wave laps above the hem of my jeans and the denim tightens around my leg. My jumper gets a splash of water on it and I know its going to take ages to dry.\n\nI look around; there are no dog walkers.\n\nI run back out, take off all of my clothes, stash them behind a rock and race back into the sea. Within seconds, Gavin has done the same thing. We swim for 20 glorious minutes, then race around the beach, totally starkers, to dry off. A couple appear at the edge of the beach, a few years older than us and mortified to have stumbled across us, naked as babies and kicking sand at each other. I dive under his coat, and whisper, \"Are they gone?!\" frantically, until he assures me that, yes, they are.\n\nIt's my happiest moment of 2016. It might even make my top five moments of all time. Giddy, naked, breathless under the icy Atlantic water and rewarded quickly afterwards with a pint of Guinness and a packet of Tayto. And grateful, so grateful, to be in a relationship with someone who also grew up in a Naked House.\n\nDid you grow up in a Naked House? I did. I had the great fortune of having a mother who was pro-nudity, and the misfortune of having a father who was obsessed with recording everything. There are hours – days maybe – of footage of me and my brother wandering around naked. The back garden, the living room, the beach – if we were there, we were naked. We’re fighting naked; we’re being read to naked. We’re three, four, five, six years old and perpetually nude. Most people have a snapshot of them and their sibling laughing in the bath to contend with – my parents have more nude footage in the can than Terrence Malick has of long grass. They weren’t naked themselves, mind – just big celebrators of the wholesomeness of childhood nudity.\n\n“But you were beautiful,” says Mum defensively, whenever we scream at our father to stop presenting our romantic partners with filmic evidence of our young genitals. “You were so free.”\n\nThere are pros and cons to all of this. Pro: this early comfort with nudity has made me profoundly comfortable in my own skin throughout my life. I don’t worry about my body or what it’s doing half as much as other women my own age, and I’m enormously glad of that fact. When clothes look bad on me, I am far more likely to blame the clothes than myself. Con: no one in my family knocks. Ever. Or, if they do, it’s that weird “courtesy knock” when someone taps lightly on the door and walks in anyway. Pro: I can talk about my body and what it’s doing. Con: I am very likely to announce to the whole office that I have thrush – and not everyone cares for thrush chat at 11am. Pro: my parents talked to me openly about sex as a teenager and I think that ultimately lead to a rich and fulfilling sex life. Con: I have seen my dad’s butt way, way too many times.\n\nIf I’m in a bikini, or in a tiny dress, I feel self-conscious. If I’m nude, I’m delighted with life. Who cares if the people in the opposite apartment can see? I don’t know them! Sure, it’s only a nipple!\n\nApparently, the big, cheery grin I had on my face the day Gavin and I turned a deserted public beach into a nudist one is to be expected – according to a study from Goldsmith’s University, people who engage in “naturalist” tendencies are far happier. This is the first study that examines whether taking off your clothes around non-intimate others actually makes you happier with your body. The study found that the longer and more frequently participants engaged in naturalism, the happier they were long-term. \"It's a pretty cheap way to be happy,\" says Dr Keon West, senior lecturer in the psychology department. \"In that, everyone can take their clothes off.\"\n\nI want to state here I think there’s a big difference between being naked and being “almost naked”. It’s a funny paradox: if I’m in a bikini, or in a tiny dress, I feel self-conscious; if I’m nude, I’m delighted with life. Who cares if the people in the opposite apartment can see? I don’t know them! Sure, it’s only a nipple!\n\nMy friend Jen, who has been to a fair few nudist beaches in her time, agrees with me. “When a woman is naked, she’s just a woman. When she puts on a bikini, she becomes a product.” She becomes someone who is wearing something correctly or incorrectly. Someone who has to worry about stray hairs and side boob and weird material suddenly becoming transparent. When you’re naked, the lack of window dressing is freeing. “I’m just a dumb animal!” I felt like screaming on the beach that day. “I’m not a sex thing! I’m a dumb, stupid, fleshy animal!”\n\nAnd that’s what growing up in a Naked House will do to you – it gives you a little bit of a sense of humour about things. Even if you do dive under a coat when the dog walkers come.\n\n@Czaroline",
  "latent_16263": "Trump speaks to supporters on election night, November 9, 2016. (Reuters photo: Mike Segar)\n\nHe had the wind at his back.\n\nHow did Donald Trump win the presidential election? In Part 1 of this four-part series, I showed how Trump had performed historically poorly by the standards of challengers in post-incumbent elections (i.e., elections with no incumbent on the ballot following the reelection of an incumbent). In Part 2, I applied the same analysis to show that Trump also didn’t do especially well in the battleground states but won because the handful of states he flipped narrowly from the Democrats were almost all large states. In Part 3, I looked at turnout — specifically, what percentage of the voting-eligible population voted for each candidate — and concluded that, while Trump did better than past GOP nominees in some states, he still underperformed and depended heavily on declining Democratic turnout.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nToday: why it’s reasonable to believe that another Republican nominee in 2016 would have collected more of the votes Trump left on the table, and some conclusions about the relative importance of trends, candidates, campaigns, and demographics.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhere Trump Left Republican Votes on the Table: The Senate\n\nWe can’t directly compare Trump to another Republican presidential nominee. He’s the only one who won the nomination, and the whole environment of the campaign would have been different with a different nominee. The only head-to-head comparisons we have are from the polls conducted during the primary, in which Trump ran terribly against Hillary Clinton, while Ted Cruz ran even with her and Marco Rubio and John Kasich ran consistently ahead, not just nationally but in the critical battleground states. Those polls are one useful apples-to-apples data point, but they also ended up badly underestimating how many Republican voters who opposed Trump in the primary ended up coming home to support him in November. So while we can conclude that Trump came out of the primaries with higher unfavorable ratings, and he appealed to a smaller potential universe of voters than his main rivals did, we can only make an educated guess about how a different nominee would have performed.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut what we can conclude is that Trump failed to win the votes of quite a lot of people who were at least open to voting for Republicans for important positions. The next best thing we have to a comparison at the presidential level is a comparison of Trump to down-ticket Republican candidates in Senate, House, and governorship races (one of whom, Rubio, had run in the primary). None of these are perfect comparisons, either: Each candidate was running in a single state or district against a different opponent, and many ran with the advantage of incumbency, or against an incumbent. The governors are the weakest parallel, as the ability to separate the race from national dynamics is probably why the Republican candidate won the Vermont governor’s race, while the Democrat won the West Virginia governor’s race.\n\nHouse Republican candidates as a whole ran ahead of Trump, winning the popular vote by 1.38 million votes, 49.1 percent to 48.0 percent. Republican candidates also ran ahead of Trump in most of the contested Senate races, although California had no Republican in its Senate race, and in the second-largest state with a Senate race, New York, Trump ran 800,000 votes ahead of Wendy Long, Chuck Schumer’s hapless opponent. Let’s look at the Senate comparison, excluding California but including Louisiana’s Election Day “jungle primary” featuring nine Republican and seven Democratic candidates. The first set of columns compares Trump’s popular vote to that of Senate Republican candidates; the second compares them by the two-party vote:\n\n1\n\nMost of the winning candidates ran ahead of Trump, especially in swing-state races, although Republicans in two contested races (Nevada and Colorado, the latter a race against a Democratic incumbent) ran a bit behind Trump, and in two others (Indiana and Missouri), they ran significantly behind. The fact that Indiana and Missouri GOP Senate candidates won but did so running well behind Trump is best explained as a result of Trump’s popularity in those states and of having Democratic candidates who were better suited to their state’s electorate than Hillary was. Trump ran behind the Republican candidate in popular-vote percentage in 23 states, and he ran behind the Republican candidate in the two-party vote in 21 states. Overall, he ran 1.1 percent behind Republican Senate candidates, 0.2 percent behind in the two-party vote. Outside New York, that widens to a two-point split in the popular vote and a one-point split in the two-party vote.\n\nThat looks like a small difference at the margins. But the statewide vote actually conceals the fact that Trump and conventional Republicans running for Senate and House seats had different coalitions that didn’t entirely overlap. When you drill down to the county level, Trump left a lot of potential Republican votes on the table — while winning a significant number of voters who didn’t usually support statewide Republicans.\n\nUsing the county-level data for the presidential and Senate races from David Leip’s U.S. Election Atlas, I compared Trump’s vote totals in each county to the vote totals for the Republican Senate candidate in that same county, in order to isolate the counties where Trump got fewer (or more) total votes than the Republican candidate for Senate. We can consider the extra votes for the Senate candidate to be potential Republican voters that a different presidential nominee might have won, or at least contended to win. On the flip side, we can consider the extra votes for Trump to be a sign of his own appeal to voters who weren’t attracted to more traditional Republicans.\n\nI left off Louisiana, since the county-level data that was available was for the runoff, and California, with no Republican Senate candidate. It’s important here to mention that there are almost always more votes cast in the presidential election than in the Senate or House races conducted the same year. While some disgruntled voters might leave the presidential line blank (in Michigan, there were significantly more of these than the margin separating the two candidates), it’s more common for people who followed the presidential race to ignore the rest of the ballot. The “P Overvote” column on this chart illustrates that 1.8 million more votes were cast in the presidential race than in these Senate races. Thus, if Trump simply ran even with down-ticket Republicans on a percentage basis, we’d expect him to be somewhere in the neighborhood of 900,000 votes ahead of them. For example, Trump got 19,031 more votes than Pat Toomey, but there were 111,156 more votes cast on the presidential line in Pennsylvania than in the Senate race. That’s why Toomey’s margin of victory was still bigger than Trump’s.\n\nInstead, if you look at the “net” column, you will see that Trump wasn’t ahead: He was 23,662 votes behind, and more than 800,000 behind outside of New York. Six Republican Senate candidates drew at least 100,000 more votes than Trump, and three (Rob Portman, Marco Rubio, and Mike Lee) drew over 200,000 more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut that’s just the statewide totals. At the county level, Trump drew more votes than the Republican candidate for Senate in 1,211 counties, and fewer in 765 counties. Trump drew more votes than the Republican candidate for Senate in every county in four states. One was Missouri, the other three were states with Senate candidates with little money or name recognition who got massacred: Oregon, Connecticut, and Hawaii. Trump also got more votes than Wendy Long in 61 of New York’s 62 counties, the sole exception being Trump’s home of Manhattan. On the other end of the scale, Trump got fewer votes than Mike Lee in every county in Utah, and fewer votes than John Hoeven in every county in North Dakota. Trump also got more votes than John Thune in just one of South Dakota’s 66 counties and more votes than Chuck Grassley in just three of Iowa’s 99 counties.\n\nBut in states where there was more variation between counties, we see the same pattern over and over: Trump won a larger number of votes in more counties, but that’s outweighed by the Republican candidate for Senate getting a larger number of votes in the larger, more populous urban and suburban counties. All told, across the 765 counties in 28 states where Trump got fewer votes than the Republican candidate for Senate, he received 2.176 million fewer votes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump ended up winning more than his share of the states where the presidential election was relatively close. He won ten of the 17 states decided by less than 10 points, six of the ten states decided by less than 4 points, four of the six states decided by less than 2 points, and three of the four states decided by less than a point. The only really close states he lost were New Hampshire (by 0.37 percent, or 2,736 votes); Minnesota (by 1.52 percent, or 44,765 votes); Nevada (by 2.42 percent, or 27,202 votes); and Maine (by 2.96 percent, or 22,242 votes). But had things gone a little differently, those 2 million votes could have made a decisive difference in a number of states. The column marked “% of State) divides the “SEN R+” column (how many fewer votes Trump received than the Republican Senate candidate in the counties where he got fewer votes) into the state’s presidential electorate. Thus, for example, the 296,541 more votes for Portman than Trump in the 63 counties where Portman got more votes equals 5.36 percent in the Ohio presidential contest. I highlighted in yellow every state where the missing Republican Senate votes cost Trump at least 2 percent of the vote. It’s not hard to picture a future election in which Trump could use an extra 4.7 points in Arizona, or 3 points in Wisconsin, or 2.8 points in Florida, or 1.6 points in Pennsylvania. Already, the margin by which Trump trailed Kelly Ayotte’s vote in six counties in New Hampshire was three times the size of Hillary Clinton’s margin of victory in the state.\n\nThe numbers above, however, are before we factor in the overvotes, below:\n\n924,712 more votes were cast on the presidential line in those 765 counties. If we arbitrarily assigned half of the overvotes to Trump (a highly variable assumption by state and county, but this is a back-of-the-envelope measure, so using something more tailored would give us a false impression of precision), the actual net number of Republican Senate votes in these counties by people who didn’t vote for Trump would be closer to 2.6 million.\n\nThe flip side of that, of course, is the counties where Trump drew more votes than the Republican Senate candidate. There were 884,545 overvotes in those counties, so using the same “haircut” reduction of half of the overvotes, Trump still drew somewhere in the neighborhood of 1.7 million more votes in these mostly rural counties. For all his weaknesses as a candidate, it’s not hard to locate evidence of a meaningful number of Trump voters who are not otherwise Republican voters.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe irony is that Trump is probably the most urban candidate ever to run for president; he’s lived his whole life in New York City and made his living building apartment buildings, hotels, and casinos, almost exclusively in urban areas. Yet, the places where he ran better than other Republicans were almost entirely in rural and small-town America. Florida is a perfect example: Marco Rubio won 200,000 or more votes in eight counties and drew at least 13,000 more votes than Trump did in seven of the eight, including 86,064 more votes in Miami-Dade County alone. Trump got more votes than Rubio in 44 counties, to Rubio’s 23, but Trump netted 52,966 more votes from those counties compared to Rubio’s extra 270,271 votes from half as many counties. Arizona is even more dramatic: John McCain’s margin over Trump was almost ten times as many extra votes from half as many counties. One rare exception was Clark County, Nev. (Las Vegas), where Trump ran 16,323 votes ahead of Joe Heck. Heck won every other county in Nevada, including Washoe County (Reno, which Trump lost), but his 82,445-vote margin of defeat in Clark County was his undoing in a race he lost by 26,915 votes.\n\nThere were 24 counties where Trump received at least 20,000 fewer votes than the Republican Senate candidate:\n\nThis list is dominated by cities: Miami, Phoenix, Orlando, Chicago, Seattle, Milwaukee, Atlanta, Salt Lake City, Des Moines, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus, Charleston, Tuscon, Provo, Raleigh, Overland Park. There are also some big suburbs, such as Montgomery County in the suburbs of Philadelphia. More than 13 million votes were cast in these counties, and Trump won 979,082 fewer votes than the Republican Senate candidates below him on the ballot.\n\nMost of these counties, outside of Illinois and Washington, were in states Trump won. Trump carried six of the 24 counties, compared to ten for the Senate candidates. Portman won Hamilton County (Cincinnati) 54–42; Trump lost it 53–24. Grassley won Polk County (Des Moines) 52–44; Trump lost it 52–40. Tim Scott carried Charleston County 56–41; Trump lost it 51–43. But even where the county-level outcomes were the same, the margins were very different. Rubio lost Miami-Dade 54–43; Trump lost it 63–34. McCain won Maricopa County (Phoenix) 55–40; Trump won it 48–45. Johnny Isakson lost Fulton County (Atlanta) 59–37; Trump lost it 68–27.\n\nIf we expand our view to counties Trump lost by 10,000 or more votes, we get a much longer list of 52 counties, in which more than 21 million votes were cast and Trump got 1,377,179 fewer votes than Republican Senate candidates:\n\nThere are a few more counties here that Trump lost while the Republican Senate candidate was winning, including Cobb County. Georgia in the Atlanta suburbs (Isakson won it 53–42; Trump lost 48–46), Chester and Bucks Counties, Pennsylvania in the Philadelphia suburbs (Toomey won Chester 49–47 and Bucks 52–47; Trump lost Chester 52–43 and Bucks 49–48), and others in Iowa, Florida, and Ohio.\n\nBy contrast, few of the counties where Trump got more votes than the Republican Senate candidate were large enough for him to outdistance them by 10,000 votes, let alone 20,000. Trump ran 20,000 or more votes ahead of the Republican Senate candidate in just 13 counties, ten of them in New York State (the others were New Haven and Hartford Counties in Connecticut and Honolulu County in Hawaii; Trump ran 39,274 votes ahead in New Haven). However, his single largest advantage over a Senate candidate was even larger than his deficit in Maricopa: He ran 103,127 votes ahead of Wendy Long in Suffolk County on Long Island, and another 80,376 votes ahead in neighboring Nassau County, as well as 70,000 votes in Erie County (Buffalo), 57,000 in Kings County (Brooklyn), 50,000 in Queens, and 38,000 in Richmond (Staten Island). That is partly explained by Trump’s standing as a hometown candidate, but more powerfully explained by how uncompetitive Long was with Chuck Schumer.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump ran 10,000 to 20,000 votes ahead in another 22 counties, nine of them in New York and six others in Oregon and Connecticut. The rest were four in Missouri plus Luzerne County in Pennsylvania (12,137 votes, Trump won 58–39 compared with 51–43 for Toomey); Madison County, Ill. (13,825 votes, Trump won 55–39, Kirk lost 50–44); and Clark County, Nev.\n\nWhere Trump Left Republican Votes on the Table: The House\n\nSixteen states didn’t have Senate races, including some hotly contested presidential battleground states (Michigan, Minnesota, Maine, Virginia) and the two states where Trump won his largest total popular-vote margins (Texas and Tennessee). Then there’s California, where there was no Republican Senate candidate. To supplement the lessons from the Senate races, let’s consider how Trump’s vote haul compared to the House races in those states. I looked at all the presidential battlegrounds and every state large enough to cast at least 2.5 million votes in the presidential contest, a total of 30 states. The results:\n\nHouse races are even harder to compare to the presidential race because we don’t yet have comprehensive data at the district level, and there were 47 uncontested races in these states (31 unopposed Democrats and 16 unopposed Republicans). But overall, there were almost 6.4 million more votes cast in the presidential race than in House races across these states, yet Trump received 204,495 fewer votes than the Republican House candidates. That number quadruples outside of Massachusetts, where Democrats won all nine House seats, five of the nine unopposed. In 18 of these 30 states, Trump received fewer votes than the Republican House candidates; in 22 of 30, he got a lower percentage of the vote. Trump got 1,394,441 fewer votes than Republican House candidates across just eight states: California, Texas, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Georgia, and Washington.\n\nIn some states, the absence of Republican candidates from the ballot makes the disparity even more dramatic. Trump got 73,567 fewer votes than House Republican candidates in Virginia even though there were 201,183 more votes cast in the presidential race in Virginia than in the House races, and even though there was no Republican candidate in Virginia’s eleventh district. There were 282,003 votes cast in the VA-11 House race.\n\nIn California, Trump got 198,223 fewer votes than House Republicans even though there were nine districts with no House Republican candidate (in which 1.7 million votes were cast) and 767,577 more votes cast in the POTUS race than in House races.\n\nThe picture from the battleground states (the ones decided by fewer than 10 points) is mixed. Trump ran significantly behind House Republicans in Georgia, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Texas, Florida, Colorado, Virginia, New Mexico, North Carolina, Arizona, Maine, and Iowa, behind in Minnesota, and behind in popular-vote percentage but barely ahead in vote totals in Nevada and Michigan. He did, however, run ahead of House Republicans in Wisconsin (where there was no Republican candidate in two of the state’s eight districts) and New Hampshire.\n\nWhere Trump Left Republican Votes on the Table: The Hispanic Vote\n\nThe demographics of voters who pulled the Republican lever in 2016 but did not vote for Trump is a broader question; the most obvious example is the Mormons, a reliable Republican-base voter group that abandoned Trump in droves. But it’s impossible to pass this topic without noticing that one of the specific ways in which Trump seems to have run behind other Republicans was with Hispanic voters.\n\nThere’s a huge methodological debate over how to count Hispanic voters and whether exit polls in particular captured them accurately. For example, the widely cited Latino Decisions polls, which had Trump doing a lot worse with Hispanic voters than the exit polls showed, are conducted in both Spanish and English, and they select Hispanic voters by looking for Hispanic surnames rather than self-identification. But even if the exit polls aren’t necessarily the last word, they offer an apples-to-apples comparison of Trump to down-ticket Republicans among the same sample of self-identified Hispanic voters. What they show is that Trump ran well behind several Republican candidates for the Senate or the governorships:\n\nAll things considered, 2016 was not the extinction-level event for Republicans among Hispanic voters that many people had expected. But while there were variations from state to state, it seems apparent that Hispanic voters were willing to draw distinctions between Trump and other Republican candidates. None of the candidates for whom we have exit-poll data actually won the Hispanic vote, but Rubio, Richard Burr, and Utah governor Gary Herbert were highly competitive. Others, such as McCain, Isakson, and Mike Lee also did respectably by running double digits ahead of Trump. In Burr’s case, he also ran double digits ahead of Pat McCrory. If you’re looking for voters who were open to a Republican message and a Republican vote in 2016 but didn’t vote for Trump, this is one group to examine more closely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nConclusion: What We Learned\n\nMany election analysts and pundits predicted that Hillary Clinton would swamp her Republican opponent, especially once it proved to be Donald Trump, because of the demographic trends that had provided Barack Obama with his margin of victory over Mitt Romney in 2012. Some of us saw things differently and predicted that the historical post-incumbent trend would make Republicans competitive or even the favorites in 2016. Of all the predictions I made in the course of this election cycle, the very first — my original September 2014 study of post-incumbent elections — stands up the best.\n\nBut like many people who were hopeful about Republican prospects entering the primaries, I was also emphatic from the beginning of the race until almost the end that Donald Trump could not possibly win it. I put my faith in the importance of candidates, and Trump’s historic and well-earned unfavorables made him look for all the world like the kind of candidates who routinely get destroyed in winnable statewide races. Even at the very end, when the polls showed enough tightening that I was warning that a Trump victory was possible, I still didn’t think it would actually happen, largely because I believed that campaigns mattered — that Trump’s lack of a get-out-the-vote operation and the Democrats’ presumed and widely reported superiority in the ground game would make the difference in a close race. This, too, proved wrong, perhaps because outsiders couldn’t see the scope of the RNC’s stand-in for the campaign ground game; outsiders also failed to see the hubristic ineptitude of the Hillary camp, especially its neglect of the Midwest in pursuit of a national wave and elusive pickup opportunities in Georgia, Arizona, and Texas.\n\nIn the end, the historic trend away from the incumbent party was the most powerful factor of all. That doesn’t mean that demographics, candidates, and campaigns didn’t matter: When placed in proper context, we can see that Trump ran well behind the historic averages and down-ticket Republicans, losing more votes from the Republican tent than he brought in.\n\nWould another Republican, or another Democrat, have done better? Trump won every single state carried by Ted Cruz or John Kasich except for Maine, where Trump carried one of the two House districts and greatly improved on past Republican performance. The only state he lost in both the primary and the general election was Minnesota. Hillary Clinton, by contrast, lost twelve of the Bernie Sanders states (Bernie also won Maine), including crucial swing states Wisconsin and Michigan, and she probably lost the popular vote to Bernie in Iowa before losing Iowa in November.\n\nHillary was clearly a bad fit for hard-to-poll white working-class voters in Michigan, where she was surprised by Bernie after leading him in the polls, and was surprised again by Trump after leading him in the polls. That may or may not have mattered as much against a Republican who didn’t sound like an economically populist Democrat. The declining turnout for both parties in November in Wisconsin may have been a sign that both nominees were bad fits for the state, where each lost the primary by 13 points.\n\nThe primaries were also an early warning of Trump’s weakness in urban and educated suburban areas: He lost Manhattan to Kasich; Kansas City, Milwaukee, and Raleigh-Durham to Cruz; and Atlanta, Charleston, Minneapolis, Little Rock, Miami, and the D.C. area to Rubio. They were also a warning that Trump would probably not run as strongly in the western half of the country compared with the eastern half, although the contested portion of the primaries ended before Trump got to the three West Coast primaries.\n\nI suspect that Trump’s unconventional campaign was the only one that could have swung Michigan for the Republican ticket, but I can’t prove this conclusively. He ran only slightly behind House Republicans there.\n\nBut there are signs that another Republican could have won the other states that decided the election, quite possibly by a wider margin, and maybe could have won other states such as Minnesota, Colorado, Virginia, or New Hampshire. Iowa, Ohio, and Wisconsin all swung hard to the Republican side in 2010, 2014, and 2016 across the board. In Ohio, that reflected a resurgence of the state’s Republican tradition and recovery from scandals of the 2005–2008 years, as well as the collapse of the Ohio Democrats. Kasich has built a powerful Republican machine there. In the Upper Midwest, demographic trends have lent a hand: In 2004, Iowa, Wisconsin, and Minnesota were among the few states in which the oldest white voters were the most liberal, and the generation born of the Great Depression has been dying off. Trump won none of those states in the primaries (Wisconsin and Minnesota were both double-digit losses, to Cruz and Rubio), and Rubio polled particularly well head-to-head in both Wisconsin and Minnesota. And, unsurprisingly, Rubio ran well ahead of Trump in November in Florida.\n\nIf Trump wants a second term, he’ll need to figure out how to win over urban, suburban, and Hispanic voters who voted for other Republicans in 2016.\n\nPennsylvania is another story: Trump really did catch fire in the rural parts of the state, both in the primaries and in November, running far ahead of Toomey, and he outdistanced Bush, Romney, and McCain in the state. But a Republican less repellent to upscale suburbanites might have matched Toomey’s much stronger showing in the Philadelphia suburbs. Unlike Arlen Specter, who ruled that region, Toomey showed that a conservative, pro-life Republican could win there in the right year. Rubio, Kasich, and possibly Cruz could have done the same.\n\nOn the other hand, it seems highly likely that any of the other Republican candidates would have run stronger in Texas, Georgia, and Arizona. But Trump’s bleeding in those states didn’t end up affecting the outcome.\n\nWe will never know for sure. What we do know is that Donald Trump had the wind at his back and did some things Republicans had not done for a long time. In the final analysis, though, he did less than the historical trends suggested were possible. If he wants a second term, he’ll need to figure out how to win over urban, suburban, and Hispanic voters who voted for other Republicans in 2016. If he wants to hand the White House to a successor, he’ll need to expand his coalition enormously.",

In few places does a visit to the land of nod seem more appealing. Is there any state more catatonic than being air-side when your flight has been delayed for eight hours until gone midnight? Or when you have a lengthy layover halfway through a mammoth journey? There are only so many times you can stroll around the shops vacantly staring at leather belts; there are only so many Bloody Marys you can sup by yourself at the bar. Yet, few places are less conducive to getting some shut-eye. First there is the noisy stream of people. Then there are the ear-splitting tannoy announcements. But more than these, there is the rock-hard seating with razor-sharp armrests, whose only purpose is to stop you sprawling out and escaping the horror. In some countries sleep deprivation is a method of torture. At JFK it is civil engineering.It has always been a mystery why airports seem so keen to stop you dozing off. (A few take things to extremes: Reykjavik even puts up signs explicitly forbidding flyers from attempting some shut-eye.) Perhaps they worry that the moment people stop moving they also stop buying duty-free. Maybe they think that a sprawling, snoring passenger will be a nuisance to those around him. They may just have never considered tired passengers’ needs. But Gulliver suspects that, like many in the commercial aviation business, they are merely sadists.\n\nI was grateful, therefore, to be pointed in the direction of “The Guide to Sleeping in Airports”. The website has just released its 2015 ranking of the best airports around the world in which to get some sleep. The bar for inclusion is pretty low: “Features likely to help boost an airport's sleep-ability factor include things like designated rest zones, comfortable couches, courtesy blankets and quiet corners in the post-security section. That, and staff sympathetic to the sleeper's cause.” That doesn’t seem too much to ask, does it? Yet remarkably few make the grade.\n\nSingapore Changi International comes out top. The website cites Singapore's free lounge chairs, low-lit relaxation zones, armrest-free seating at the gates, free massage chairs and easy chairs. Gulliver can’t quibble. It is, undoubtedly, one of the most pleasant airports that I have passed through—even when on one of those aforementioned long layovers. Others in the top five are Seoul Incheon, Helsinki, Munich and Vienna. To no one’s surprise, given its zero-tolerance policy, Reykjavik is rated the world’s most sleep-unfriendly. As if visiting the land of the midnight sun weren't tiring enough already.",
  "latent_16353": "Fashion mogul Donna Karan is apologizing after praising Harvey Weinstein following his firing from his film company amid allegations of sexual harassment lasting decades.\n\nIn a statement Monday, Karan said her remarks were taken out of context and don't represent her feelings. She says she believes \"sexual harassment is NOT acceptable and this is an issue that MUST be addressed once and for all regardless of the individual.\"\n\nKaran on Sunday suggested to The Daily Mail that Weinstein’s alleged victims may have been ‘asking for it’ in a rambling interview that questioned the way women dressed and how they present themselves to the world.\n\nThe DKNY designer was in Los Angeles for the CineFashion Film Awards and told a reporter that, “'To see it here in our own country is very difficult, but I also think how do we display ourselves? How do we present ourselves as women? What are we asking? Are we asking for it by presenting all the sensuality and all the sexuality?\n\nMeanwhile, among those weighing in were his longtime allies and beneficiaries Meryl Streep, Kate Winslet, Kevin Smith and Judi Dench. They spoke up with a combination of disgust over his alleged behavior and remorse or defensiveness over their own business entanglements with him. Even the actors’ labor union SAG-AFTRA joined the chorus in condemning the disgraced movie mogul, calling reports of his alleged conduct “abhorrent and unacceptable.”\n\nDirector Kevin Smith, whose movies “Clerks” and “Chasing Amy” were produced by Weinstein, noted on Twitter that the producer financed the first 14 years of his career.\n\n“Now I know while I was profiting, others were in terrible pain,” Smith wrote. “It makes me feel ashamed.”\n\nWeinstein, 65, was fired Sunday by the Weinstein Co., the studio he co-founded, three days after a bombshell New York Times expose alleged decades of crude sexual behavior on his part toward female employees and actresses, including Ashley Judd. The Times said at least eight settlements had been reached with women.\n\nStreep, who once called Weinstein “God” while accepting the Golden Globe for “The Iron Lady,” condemned his alleged conduct as “inexcusable” while also saying she did not know about it before.\n\n“The disgraceful news about Harvey Weinstein has appalled those of us whose work he championed, and those whose good and worthy causes he supported,” Streep said in a statement.\n\nStories of his behavior, she said, were not universally known in Hollywood.\n\n“Harvey supported the work fiercely, was exasperating but respectful with me in our working relationship, and with many others with whom he worked professionally,” Streep continued. “If everybody knew, I don’t believe that all the investigative reporters in the entertainment and the hard news media would have neglected for decades to write about it.”\n\nSimilarly, Dench, whose awards and nominations have been inextricably linked for two decades to Weinstein, first at his company Miramax and then at the Weinstein Co., said in a statement that she was “completely unaware” of the “horrifying” offenses.\n\n“I offer my sympathy to those who have suffered and wholehearted support to those who have spoken out,” she wrote.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report",

This grants you the following benefits: • You ignore difficult terrain. • You have advantage on initiative rolls. • On your first turn during combat, you have advantage on attack rolls against creatures that have not yet acted. In addition, you are skilled at navigating the wilderness. You gain the following benefits when traveling for an hour or more: • Difficult terrain doesn’t slow your group’s travel. • You have advantage on survival checks to stop you getting lost. • You have advantage on perception checks even when you are engaged in another activity while traveling (such as foraging, navigating, or tracking), you remain alert to danger. • If you are traveling alone, you can move stealthily at a normal pace. • When you forage, you find twice as much food as you normally would. • While tracking other creatures, you also learn their rough number, their different sizes, and how long ago they passed Fighting Style At 2nd level, you adopt a particular style of fighting as your specialty. Choose one of the following options. You can’t take a Fighting Style option more than once, even if you later get to choose again. Archery You gain a +2 bonus to attack rolls you make with ranged weapons. Defense While you are wearing armor, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. Dueling When you are wielding a melee weapon in one hand and no other weapons, you gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with that weapon. Two-Weapon Fighting When you engage in two-weapon fighting, you can add your ability modifier to the damage of the second attack. Spell Casting By the time you reach 2nd level, you have learned to use the magical essence of nature to cast spells, much as a druid does. See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the ranger spell list. Spell Slots The Ranger table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your spells of 1st level and higher. To cast one of these spells, you must expend a slot of the spell’s level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest. For example, if you know the 1st-level spell animal friendship and have a 1st-level and a 2nd-level spell slot available, you can cast animal friendship using either slot. Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher You know two 1st-level spells of your choice from the ranger spell list. The Spells Known column of the Ranger table shows when you learn more ranger spells of your choice. Each of these spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots. For instance, when you reach 5th level in this class, you can learn one new spell of 1st or 2nd level. Additionally, when you gain a level in this class, you can choose one of the ranger spells you know and replace it with another spell from the ranger spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots. Spellcasting Ability Wisdom is your spellcasting ability for your ranger spells, since your magic draws on your attunement to nature. You use your Wisdom whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability. In addition, you use your Wisdom modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a ranger spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one. Spell save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Spell attack modifier = your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier Primeval Awareness = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier= your proficiency bonus + your Wisdom modifier You have an innate ability to communicate with beasts, and they recognize you as a kindred spirit. Through sounds and gestures, you can communicate simple ideas to a beast as an action, and can read its basic mood and intent. You learn its emotional state, whether it is affected by magic of any sort, its short-term needs (such as food or safety), and actions you can take (if any) to persuade it to not attack. You cannot use this ability against a creature that you have attacked within the past 10 minutes. Additionally, you can attune your senses to determine if any of your favored enemies lurk nearby. By spending 1 uninterrupted minute in concentration (as if you were concentrating on a spell), you can sense whether any of your favored enemies are present within 2 miles of you. This feature reveals which of your favored enemies are present, their rough numbers, and the creatures' general direction and distance from you. If there are multiple groups of your favored enemies within range, you learn this information for each group. Ranger Conclave At 3rd level, you choose to emulate the ideals and training of a ranger conclave: the Beast Conclave, the Hunter Conclave, or the Stalker Conclave, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 5th, 7th, 11th, and 15th level. 2\n\nAbility Score Improvement When you reach 4th level, and again at 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level, you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. As normal, you can’t increase an ability score above 20 using this feature. Greater Favored Enemy At 6th level, you are ready to hunt even deadlier game. Choose a type of greater favored enemy: aberrations, celestials, constructs, dragons, elementals, fiends, or giants. You gain all the benefits against this chosen enemy that you normally gain against your favored enemy, including an additional language. Your bonus to damage rolls against all your favored enemies increases to +4. Additionally, you have advantage on saving throws against the spells and abilities used by a greater favored enemy. Beginning at 8th level, you can use the Dash action as a bonus action on your turn. Hide in Plain Sight Starting at 10th level, you can remain perfectly still for long periods of time to set up ambushes. When you attempt to hide on your turn, you can opt to not move on that turn. If you avoid moving, creatures that attempt to detect you take a −10 penalty to their Wisdom (Perception) checks until the start of your next turn. You lose this benefit if you move or fall prone, either voluntarily or because of some external effect. You are still automatically detected if any effect or action causes you to no longer be hidden. If you are still hidden on your next turn, you can continue to remain motionless and gain this benefit until you are detected. Vanish Starting at 14th level, you can use the Hide action as a bonus action on your turn. Also, you can’t be tracked by nonmagical means, unless you choose to leave a trail. Feral Senses At 18th level, you gain preternatural senses that help you fight creatures you can’t see. When you attack a creature you can’t see, your inability to see it doesn’t impose disadvantage on your attack rolls against it. You are also aware of the location of any invisible creature within 30 feet of you, provided that the creature isn’t hidden from you and you aren’t blinded or deafened. Foe Slayer At 20th level, you become an unparalleled hunter. Once on each of your turns, you can add your Wisdom modifier to the attack roll or the damage roll of an attack you make. You can choose to use this feature before or after the roll, but before any effects of the roll are applied. Credit: unknown (damn you pinterest) 3 Credit: unknown (damn you pinterest)\n\nRanger Arche-type At 3rd level, a ranger gains the Ranger Archetype feature. Here is the Revised Monster Slayer. Monster Slayer Revised Rangers of the Slayer Conclave seek out vampires, dragons, evil fey, fiends, and other powerful threats that would do harm in this world. Trained in a variety of arcane and divine techniques to overcome such monsters, slayers are experts at unearthing weaknesses and defeating mighty foes. Slayer’s Mysticism You learn an additional spell when you reach certain levels in this class, as shown in the Slayer Spells table. The spell counts as a ranger spell for you but doesn’t count against the number of ranger spells you know. Slayer Spells Ranger Level Spell 3rd Protection from Evil and Good, Slayers Mark 5th Zone of Truth 9th Magic Circle 13th Banishment 17th Planar Binding Slayers Mark Starting at 3rd level, you gain the ability to study and unravel a creature’s defenses. To learn their inate weaknesses you must first witness the foe in combat, and then spend a short rest to disect the body to unravel their inner workings. On a successful investigation check on a dead foe, they are added to you known foes list. Slayers Mark 1st-level divination Casting Time: 1 bonus action\n\n1 bonus action Range: 120 feet\n\n120 feet Components: Verbal\n\nVerbal Duration: Concentration up to 1 hour You choose a known creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Perception (Wisdom) or Survival (Wisdom) checks you make to find or recall information on it. When the target is a known foe the damage is increased to an extra 2d6. If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature. Extra Attack When the target is athe damage is increased to an extra 2d6.If the target drops to 0 hit points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn of yours to mark a new creature. Beginning at 5th level, you can attack twice, instead of once, whenever you take the Attack action on your turn. Supernatural Defense At 7th level, you gain extra resilience against your prey’s assaults on your mind and body. Whenever the target of your Slayer’s Mark forces you to make a saving throw, add 1d6 to your roll. Relentless Slayer At 11th level, you gain the ability to foil your foe’s ability to escape. Your study of folklore and arcane knowledge gives you a key insight to keep your prey cornered. If the target of your Slayer’s Mark attempts to teleport, change its shape, travel to another plane of existence, or turn gaseous, you can use your reaction to make a Wisdom check contested by a Wisdom check made by the target. To use this ability, you must be able to see the target and need to be within 30 feet of it. If you succeed, you foil its attempt, causing it to waste the action, bonus action, or reaction it used. Slayers Counter At 15th level, you gain the ability to counterattack when your prey tries to sabotage you. If the target of your Slayer’s Mark forces you to make a saving throw, you can use your reaction to make one weapon attack against it. You make this attack immediately before making the saving throw. If the attack hits, your save automatically succeeds, in addition to the attacks normal affects. 4",

  "latent_16476": "Famed Bay Area punk trio Green Day returned Friday with their tenth studio album, Revolution Radio. Clocking in at a mere 44 minutes, the collection of down-and-dirty cuts reels in the grandiosity that defined 2009’s 21st Century Breakdown and 2012’s triology of ¡Uno!, ¡Dos!, and ¡Tré! — and frontman Billie Joe Armstrong, 44, says the reception so far has been astounding.\n\n“Without any exaggeration, it’s been the most positive response that we’ve ever had,” he tells EW. “I would even say more than American Idiot, because this record is probably more anticipated — where I think Idiot was more unexpected.”\n\nAs with all Green Day music, punk dominates Revolution Radio‘s aesthetic. But other styles — from vintage rhythm and blues to classic rock — periodically cut through the rebellious squall the band has perfected since their days as teenagers performing at Berkeley’s legendary 924 Gilman Street club.\n\nArmstrong connected with EW to discuss the music that has most influenced him throughout his life.\n\nTHE FIRST ALBUM I WAS OBSESSED WITH AS A KID: The Sun Sessions, Elvis Presley\n\nThere was a lot of Elvis in my house, because my mom is of that generation. All of his movement, the way he played guitar… I was attracted to it right away. I picked up that record and the first song I heard was “Mystery Train” and just how spooky it felt.\n\nTHE FIRST ALBUM I BOUGHT WITH MY OWN MONEY: The Monkees Greatest Hits, the Monkees\n\nI got it on eight-track at Fiat Music Company in Pinole, Calif. I remember singing “Pleasant Valley Sunday.” We watched the syndicated Monkees television show after school every day. It was pretty cool.\n\nTHE FIRST SONG I LEARNED TO PLAY: “Johnny B. Goode,” Chuck Berry\n\nI got my first guitar when I was 8 years old. It was a Hohner Les Paul. I had a guitar teacher back then; he’s the one that showed me how to play that song. It was the first song [where] I realized, “Oh, I’m playing something!” It shaped everything I did after that, subconsciously, for the rest of my life.\n\nTHE MUSIC THAT INSPIRED ME TO BECOME AN ARTIST: “Don’t Want to Know if You Are Lonely,” Hüsker Dü\n\nI’ve been playing music ever since I can remember, but when I first started getting into alternative music, I picked up [1986’s] Candy Apple Grey by Hüsker Dü, because I was watching the video for “Don’t Want to Know if You Are Lonely” on 120 Minutes on MTV. I was immediately blown away by that song. I started a long love affair with Hüsker Dü. I wanted to be like Hüsker Dü when I started Green Day.\n\nTHE CONCERT THAT CHANGED MY LIFE: The Replacements at the Fillmore in San Francisco, 1987\n\nMy sister took me. That was my first time at the Fillmore. It changed my attitude toward playing rock & roll. It humanized it, watching the Replacements, sort of half drunk but playing. They were [having] a good night, so it was great.\n\nTHE CONCERT I’D GO TO IF I HAD A TIME MACHINE: The Who at University of Leeds, 1970\n\nJust to see them play “A Quick One, While He’s Away,” with all the original members. And seeing [drummer] Keith Moon—he was poetry in motion.\n\nTHE MUSIC I LISTEN TO BEFORE PERFORMING: Bikini Kill\n\n[Frontwoman] Kathleen [Hanna] is one of my favorite singers. Bikini Kill embody everything that I love about music: They’re full of power, there’s a vulnerability about them, and obviously there’s the political side. It’s great to listen to before a gig, because it totally gets me jacked up and ready to play. Kathleen Hanna makes me drunk.\n\nMY ALL-TIME FAVORITE MUSICIAN: Joey Ramone\n\nJoey is the Jesus of punk. He has this endearing quality where his voice matches the way he looked. He’s incredibly handsome, in a praying-mantis kind of way. He’s just gangly and long-legged and his voice [sounds like] that—it’s like a really insecure kid that’s become empowered through rock & roll music.\n\nTHE MUSIC I ENJOY PLAYING WITH MY FAMILY: Songs by our own band, the Boo\n\nWe wanted to start a dysfunctional Partridge Family kind of band. We came up with a bunch of songs and I convinced [my wife] Adrienne to sing. She just sounds like a total girl-group diva.\n\nTHE MUSIC I ENJOY LISTENING TO WITH MY KIDS: The Who, Dog Party\n\nJust the other day, my youngest son, Jakob, was suddenly going through a Who phase. I was all over it, to the point where I was probably the annoying dad. They’ve got great taste in music, and then they turn me onto new music all the time. Even the band Dog Party that’s out with us [on tour], I heard about them through my sons.\n\nTHE ARTIST CURRENTLY MAKING THE BEST BOUNDARY-PUSHING MUSIC\n\nGreen Day, duh!\n\nTHE MUSIC I WANT PLAYED AT MY FUNERAL: “Waiting on a Friend,” the Rolling Stones\n\nIt’s one of the best songs they’ve ever written. When you’re up in heaven, or wherever you’re at, you’re just waiting for friends to come along. For something dark like a funeral, it’s a bit more positive.\n\nTHE MUSIC I LISTEN TO BEFORE I GO TO SLEEP: Cannibal Corpse\n\nI’m just goofing around! [Laughs] I have too much music going on in my brain. If I listened to anything else before I went to bed, it’d drive me crazy.",

  "latent_17089": "AutoGuide.com\n\nAhead of its debut at the Frankfurt Auto Show in just a few weeks Ferrari has released a new selection of images of its upcoming 458 Italia – the successor to the F430. Previous photos were just computer generated images, but this latest selections show the 458 in the flesh and driving at speed.\n\nWhile you’re likely to spend time staring at the dynamic track photos, Ferrari is more interested in the interior pics. The reason for this is that Ferrari engineers and designers worked hand in hand to create the interior of the 458 Italia, inventing ways to make the cockpit a more driver-focused environment. To do this all of the steering-column mounted stalks have been eliminated with items like the turn signals, high-beams and wiper functions now located on the steering wheel. Even the button to select the different shock settings has been moved onto the wheel, directly next to the Engine Start button.\n\nWith all main commands on the steering wheel, all secondary items have been moved to one of two satellite pods on either side of the dash. The pod on the right side now includes all infotainment, Bluetooth, satellite and back-up camera items, while the left side pod includes items like cruise control.\n\nThe idea is to allow the driver to focus more on the road, both enhancing safety and increasing the driving experience.\n\nPowering the 458 is a 4.5-liter V8 that puts out an incredible 570hp at 9000 rpm and 398 ft-lbs of torque at 6000 rpm – 80 percent of which is available at just 3250 rpm.\n\nThe new engine it a typically high compression Ferrari V8 rated at 12.5:1 and uses direct-injection technology. This means it gets better fuel economy that otherwise might be expected with a combined city/highway rating of 17.2 mpg. In comparison, the F430 only got 16 mpg on the highway.\n\nUsing an aluminum chassis and plenty of other light weight metals and materials the 458 Italia weighs an astonishingly low 3,043 lbs in its dry form (expect an extra 100 to 200 lbs with all fluids in place).\n\nCombining these factors with a new smooth-shifting dual-clutch 7-speed transmission (that Ferrari claims is faster than the current F1 tranny), the 458 Italia can hit 62 mph in just 3.4 seconds and blast on to a top speed of 202 mph.\n\nAs expected, however, the 458 is about far more than straight line speed and so Ferrari has worked hard at applying its racing technology to improve the E-Diff differential and F1-Trac traction control systems to allow the newest prancing horse to put down 32 percent more power out of the corners.\n\nGALLERY: 2010 Ferrari 458 Italia\n\nOfficial release:\n\nPress Release\n\nMaranello, 26 August 2009 – In the run-up to the official unveiling of the Ferrari 458 Italia at the Frankfurt Motor Show on the 15th of September, enthusiasts can find out more about the car on www.ferrari.com. There they will find the first photographs of the 458 Italia’s interior and of the steering wheel and instrument binnacle which represent a significant step forward in the concept of the ergonomic interface between driver and car. In fact the main commands are now grouped on the steering wheel, the secondary commands are handily set in two satellite pods either side of the dash and there are now comprehensive instrument displays on the panel ahead of the driver. These solutions represent an important safety aspect, enabling the driver to concentrate fully on driving. Similarly this layout ensures maximum control of the car in high- performance driving, an uncompromising approach that derives directly from Ferrari’s F1 experience. Working closely with the Ferrari Styling Centre, the engineers have thus reinterpreted the positioning of the major commands to provide a truly driver-oriented cockpit. All steering-column mounted stalks have been eliminated, with the indicators, full beam, flash and windscreen wiper functions now being activated by buttons on the steering wheel boss. The button to select the shock absorber setting is now positioned next to the ‘Engine start’ button where it falls readily to hand. Behind the wheel are a number of secondary functions, such as the stereo, while the gearbox paddles are now longer making shifts even easier from any steering angle. The right-hand satellite pod on the dash incorporates controls for the infotainment, the Bluetooth connection, sat-nav, digital speedo and rear parking camera. Clustered on the left-hand satellite pod instead are the optional cruise control, buttons for choosing the video setting of the left-hand dash TFT screen and the on-board computer interface. The latter controls the trip computer, the Vehicle Dynamic Assistance and the display of the car’s set-up.\n\nThe Vehicle Dynamic Assistance monitors the operating parameters of the most important areas of the car – engine/gearbox, tyres and brakes. The VDA is enabled in the following manettino settings – Race, CT off and CST off – and provides visual confirmation of the status of each component based on an algorithm from parameters reading lateral and longitudinal acceleration, revs and speed. This enables the driver to assess the ideal operating conditions for the car. There are three status settings: WARM-UP (operating temperature too low), GO (ideal operating conditions) and OVER (one or more components are no longer at their optimum level and need cooling).\n\nAlong with the photos now on-line, the Ferrari site also includes an exclusive video- interview with Paolo Pininfarina, Chairman of Pininfarina S.p.A., who provides in- depth insight into the 458 Italia’s design philosophy and exterior styling. The next release on www.ferrari.com will include an analysis of the car’s performance characteristics with an interview with seven-times F1 World Champion Michael Schumacher.",
  "latent_17118": "Constitution Violated by Senate President in Veto Override\n\nAnyone who has followed Maryland politics knows that the Senate President has long ignored the Maryland Constitution, much to the chagrin of the citizenry. There is no accountability under law because no one is willing to challenge him in court. Instead, he has been given full reign to abuse his authority to the detriment of Marylanders.\n\nIn pushing through an override of the Governor’s vetoes today, he made 3 major Constitutional violations of a section that was created solely to “guard against hasty or partial legislation and encroachment of the Legislative Department”.\n\nThe Constitution: Background\n\nSEC. 17. (a) To guard against hasty or partial legislation and encroachment of the Legislative Department upon the co-ordinate Executive and Judicial Departments, every Bill passed by the House of Delegates and the Senate, before it becomes a law, shall be presented to the Governor of the State. If the Governor approves he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it with his objections to the House in which it originated, which House shall enter the objections at large on its Journal and proceed to reconsider the Bill. Each House may adopt by rule a veto calendar procedure that permits Bills that are to be reconsidered to be read and voted upon as a single group. The members of each House shall be afforded reasonable notice of the Bills to be placed on each veto calendar. Upon the objection of a member, any Bill shall be removed from the veto calendar. If, after such reconsideration, three-fifths of the members elected to that House pass the Bill, it shall be sent with the objections to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if it passes by three-fifths of the members elected to that House it shall become a law.\n\nTrending: Maryland Democratic Official Crosses the Line\n\n(d) Any Bill vetoed by the Governor shall be returned to the House in which it originated immediately after the House has organized at the next regular or special session of the General Assembly. The Bill may then be reconsidered according to the procedure specified in this section.\n\nThe key word is “proceed,” which is an immediate action. There is no allowance for a delay of any type except that vetoed bills can be lumped together and that notice is provided.\n\nThe Maryland Manual stresses the immediacy because it is undeniably stated in the Constitution:\n\n“The power to override a veto rests with the General Assembly. If the Governor vetoes a bill during a regular session, the General Assembly immediately considers the Governor’s veto message. If the Governor vetoes a bill presented after the session, the veto message must be considered immediately at the next regular or special session of the legislature. The General Assembly may not override a veto during the first year of a new legislative term since the bill would have been passed by the previous legislature (Const., Art. II, sec. 17). A three-fifths vote of the elected membership of both chambers is necessary to override a veto.”\n\nToday’s Violations\n\nThere were four violations that took place today in the State Senate:\n\n1. The Senate President postponed the voting of an override for the veto of 2015’s SB 340 until today, February 9, 2016. Session began on Wednesday, January 13, which makes it the 27th day following the date that the vote on the veto was to take place. That is 30% into the 90 day session.\n\n2. The delay allowed for Delegate Craig Zucker to vote on the measure in the House of Delegates then vote on the measure in the State Senate after receiving an appointment to the Senate. The intent of the Constitution was to decrease the ability for the legislature to abuse its authority, yet the violation of the Constitution above was committed to allow for a legislator to receive two votes on the issue.\n\nAdditionally, the language is that “three-fifths of the members elected to that House” and not “three-fifths of the members of that House.” An appointment is not an election. This choice of language is clear because the appointment process is discussed elsewhere in the Constitution, and it is intended to ensure that the citizens, and not a legislative officer, have the authority to determine who can vote on a veto override. See Article III on the difference between “elected” and “chosen” and how some language specifies those “members elected” (Sect. 14), “members” (Sect. 15), and “whole number of members elected” (Sect. 28).\n\n3. There was a double vote on a veto override today. The official journal lists the activity as “Motion Reconsider vote (Senator Klausmeier) Adopted (29-18).” At no time does the Constitution allow for a reconsideration of a vote for a veto override.\n\n4. The list of names required under the Constitution to be immediately entered into the public journal were immediately entered into the public journal for the multiple veto override votes the State Senate took. Official vote counts were released late by each house. This list of names was withheld to prevent citizen activism to put pressure on those who voted on the measure.\n\nConclusions\n\nThere have always been questions as to the constitutionality of many activities pushed by the Senate President, including running multiple “days” of the session on the same calendar day to get around the Constitution’s requirement that each bill be heard on three different days (Art. III, Sect. 27 (a)) or the addition of expenditures to the budget without Gubernatorial consent (Art. III, Sect. 52).\n\nThese activities could constitution as a break from what he swore in the Oath of Office, “I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to the State of Maryland, and support the Constitution and Laws thereof” (Art. I, Sect. 9).\n\nViolating aspects of the State Constitution as an elected official is a serious offense with serious consequences: “and any person violating said oath, shall, on conviction thereof, in a Court of Law, in addition to the penalties now, or hereafter, to be imposed by Law, be thereafter incapable of holding any office of profit or trust in this State” (Art. I, Sect. 11).",
  "latent_17167": "Calm down, it’s not that funny!\n\nWhen you’re trying to understand a complex phenomenon, a sensible approach is to pare things back as far as possible. For a new study, published recently in the Journal of Memory and Language, psychologists have applied that very principle to test a popular theory of humour.\n\nThe theory states that, fundamentally, we are most often amused when we are surprised by, and then resolve, an apparent incongruity: a word that didn’t mean what we originally thought, say, or a person not being who we first expected and so on (also known as expectancy violation). It can be difficult to test this theory because in real life jokes and funny situations so many other factors come into play (such as cultural knowledge or people’s reputations), layered atop this fundamental mechanism. To test the theory in its purest terms, Chris Westbury and his colleagues have explored the possibility that some nonsense words are inherently funnier than others at least in part because they are simply just less expected.\n\nThe researchers first established that some nonsense words are consistently rated as funnier than others. To do this, they used a computer programme to generate thousands of random nonsense words and then asked nearly a thousand students to rate them for funniness. To make sure the nonsense words were viable and pronounceable, the programme was computed to make sure that every three letters in each nonsense word actually appeared in a real English word. Any words that sounded the same as actual real words (but spelt differently) were removed.\n\nThe first key finding was that there was a significant amount of consistency in the students’ ratings – that is, some nonsense words were consistently rated as funny (such as blablesoc), while others were consistently rated as unfunny (such as exthe). This was true even after all the rude-sounding nonsense words were removed, an important step since the researchers didn’t want implied meanings to contaminate the results. Among the rude-sounding words were whong, dongl, focky, and clunt, which consistently attracted the highest humour ratings before being removed.\n\nNext, to specifically test the theory that humour is often based on resolved incongruities, the researchers created a new list of nonsense words and calculated the entropy of each – this essentially means quantifying how unlikely each word was; that is, how far removed it is from being a real word. The researchers predicted that the less entropy in a nonsense word (i.e. the less “wordy” it was), the funnier it would be, because it would more strongly challenge people’s expectation for what counts as a real word. Among the lowest entropy words used in the study included subvick, quingel, and probble, while among the highest entropy words were tatinse, retsits and tessina (rude-sounding words were again removed).\n\nTwo experiments supported the researchers’ predictions: when comparing the humorousness of pairs of nonsense words, 56 participants consistently gave higher funniness ratings to the lower entropy word, and also when simply rating the nonsense words for their humour value, lower entropy words tended to receive higher ratings. The researchers said these results are entirely in line with the expectation violation theory: “Nonwords [are sometimes] funny because they violate our expectations of what a word is,” they said. As to why we find unexpected events, including nonsense words, funny, perhaps even chuckling a little out loud, Westbury and his team said their findings can be interpreted in line with a recent evolutionary account of humour:\n\n“… it has proven adaptive across evolutionary time for us to be structured in a way that makes us involuntarily let conspecifics [friends and family] know about anomalies that we have recognised are not at all dangerous, since anomalies are generally experienced as frightening.”\n\nThe researchers added that as well as supporting the resolved incongruity theory of humour, their results also have some potential applied uses. For example, testing patients reactions to nonsense words could provided a very sensitive and subtle measure of their sense of humour, which can be impaired by brain damage or illness. “The effect may also have practical effects in product naming,” they said. “If it can be shown that the computable funniness of a name is a relevant factor in consumer behaviour. We predict that consumers will strongly prefer (funny nonsense words) ‘whook’ or ‘mamessa’ to (unfunny nonsense words) ‘turth’ or ‘suppect’ for a new product name.”\n\n_________________________________\n\nWestbury, C., Shaoul, C., Moroschan, G., & Ramscar, M.

  "latent_17219": "Eurogamer has received multiple reports of Diablo 3 accounts being hacked.\n\nOver the weekend Eurogamer writer Christian Donlan saw his account hacked and transferred to the control of the mysterious Anna. Her conversation with Eurogamer reviews editor Oli Welsh is documented below.\n\nA quick glance online shows multiple reports of Diablo 3 accounts being hacked, suggesting it is a growing issue. Players have seen the loss of items stored in character inventory and stash, and gold removed as their accounts are stripped bare. Blizzard has been working to \"roll back\" affected characters to a point before accounts were compromised, but some progress is lost.\n\nThe reports coincided with the EU Diablo 3 servers going offline on Sunday afternoon for around four hours, preventing players from logging in (error 33). It has been suggested that the EU servers were taken offline following a SQL injection attack, but this remains unconfirmed.\n\nBlizzard offers an Authenticator designed to provide extra security to your account. Donlan did not have the authenticator before the hack, but reports suggest accounts have been compromised even with this enabled.\n\nOne theory suggested by players on the Battle.net forum revolves around hijacking session identifiers, which would allow hackers to take over accounts without alerting Blizzard's authentication server. Again, this remains unconfirmed.\n\nWhatever the cause, Blizzard will be keen to address the situation quickly, especially in light of the upcoming release of the real money auction house and the growing complaints from players. Blizzard said last week it was set for release at the end of the month.\n\nEurogamer has requested comment from Blizzard, which is yet to address the issue.",

  "latent_17359": "For some time now I’ve speculated about the Oregon Ducks’ defense. I’ve had my concerns about it but I was having a difficult time picking on a team that was 13-0. I also couldn’t pinpoint the issue. If any at all. Perhaps I need to up my criticism game? But since winning their lucky thirteenth, the Ducks have stopped exactly no one from scoring.\n\nWithout the advantage of having watched a ton of Oregon basketball and with the advantages of having a social life and a highly analytical mind (which behooves me in sports and torments me in dating), I’ve come to the following conclusion about Oregon’s defense: they’re the perfect storm of bad. I’ll explain.\n\nOn Dana Altman’s roster, there are just a shade under two million guards. Loyd, Artis, Joseph, Calliste, and Dotson make up one of the most formidable back courts I’ve ever heard of. Offensively that is. Otherwise they’re a group contributing to the nation’s 152nd best defense. My assumption has been that the guards aren’t carrying their weight considering four of their top five players in terms of %min are guards. So I don’t think they’ve done their light front court any favors.\n\nI’ll begin anecdotally and tell you that, certainly in their conference games, this perimeter group hasn’t done much to limit dribble penetration. It’s what my Buffalo friends told me. My Cal friends told me it had to do with an inability to protect the paint. Even my Oregon compatriots confirmed.\n\nPorous perimeter defense theory confirmed anecdotally? Check.\n\nBut anecdotal tales of a perimeter defense lost at sea aren’t going to cut it here. This is PacHoops and while I talk to some of the most brilliant and trusted minds in Conference of Champion theory – seriously, my g-chat windows are to Pac-12 thought what Cafe Trieste was to the Beatniks – we need more than perception. This is some Ginsberg, Kerouac shit.\n\nLet me begin by saying we’re going to go ahead and agree and assume that Oregon’s front court is already not the best defensively. They’re undersized and undermanned with Mike Moser (6’8″) and Richard Amardi (6’8″) getting the lion’s share of big man tick. Size doesn’t dictate defensive prowess but sometimes being the 11th worst defensive rebounding team in the conference (and 230th worst in the nation) while combining to commit more than 11 fouls per forty minutes can support that assumption. Ben Carter was expected to have a bit more impact but he sold his shoes and so he’s just now getting to lace them back up. Let’s move on.\n\nHere is what Oregon’s defense breaks down to:\n\nI’ll get this started with the jump shooting defenses and leave the rim stuff for later. The rim stuff is my favorite so we’ll call it dessert. The shooting D is slightly below average. The yellow indicates they allow an average amount of twos and threes as well as an average 3FG% against (158). That’s fine. Average defense masked by a superior offense can get things done. But that’s only on threes which is generally not the most exciting defense to discuss because, as KenPom explains, sometimes taking a three is like playing the lottery. Thus, three point defense becomes an interesting point of defensive philosophy. For the Ducks it seems to be a shot they’ll let opponents take a comfortable amount of, letting them gamble a little but not a lot.\n\nSo with regards to my porous perimeter theory, I’m left to see that against that very average number of two-point jumpers, teams are hitting a very un-average percentage of them. Opponents are shooting 37.3% in the two-point jumper range and that ranks 251st in ‘Murica. To me, and in an effort to support my theory, this suggests that the already undersized and undermanned front court is being confronted with the defensive challenge of stopping dribbling guards. To stop the same guys who’ve just blown past a Duck guard and who are now able to do one of two things:\n\nHit a relatively uncontested two point jumper that teams are doing at a relatively high level, OR Getting to the rim!\n\nOregon is allowing 39% of shots against them to come at the rim which ranks 205th in the nation and 11th in the Pac-12. Now this doesn’t necessarily mean they do a poor job of defending the rim so we can cite their opponents’ FG% at the rim. This is 59.1%, 186th in the nation and 9th in the conference. Those powers combined – high percentage of shots at the rim and high percentage being made – and you have the perfect storm of bad defense. Penetration leads to easy jumpers or a shot at the rim.\n\nFurthermore – and this might be the toughest part of it all – the Ducks are allowing the 226th highest free throw rate in the nation meaning – and this is a very loose description – opponents are getting to the line on about 43.1% of their possessions. This of course isn’t taking into account all of the factors that define a game’s possessions but it’s how I’ve chosen to explain FT rate in this context. It gives us an idea not a fact, chill out.\n\nBut why it further contributes to this poor Duck defense is that Oregon is playing with the 18th most possessions per game in the nation. Ipso facto, Duck opponents are getting more possessions too and if they’re getting fouled on those – or easily to the rim – then they’re going to score more points. More points = bad defense.\n\nPorous perimeter defense theory confirmed quantifiably ? Meh.\n\nDefense is so difficult to quantify and it’s really tough to pinpoint a single weakness without watching all of their games, breaking down tape. I’m not going to watch all of their games. And I won’t soon tell you Oregon is a good defensive team. We’ve gone pretty extensively into a few reasons why they struggle. Areas in which they can and need to improve.\n\nI can say that Oregon is an average defensive team. Their defensive efficiency ranks just a few tenths of a point above average (103.3 vs. 104.1) and prior to entering Pac-12 play, Oregon had played a very average schedule. Their non-conference strength of schedule ranked 211th. Average opposition + average defense + elite offense = 13-0. Note that the Ducks’ three conference losses are to 3 of the 4 highest KenPom rated teams they’ve played. It’s why the Duck SOS was on my Fourteen Things to Watch list (#5).\n\nThis isn’t a Duck death certificate. As good friend and Duck fan Matt told me, “Altman’s defense is a process, not a formula.” I love this concept and believe he’s right. There were going to be growing pains with such turnover and Altman should be applauded for what he’s done. A season ago he was coaching a top-10 defense and a season later he’s coaching a top-10 offense. He’s done both successfully. Their current slide perhaps supports the adage that defense wins championships. The Ducks, after all, did win the 2013 Pac-12 Tournament.\n\nThe best part about defense, however, is it can often be a simple test of fortitude. Sometimes you can just choose to be a better defender. With Arsalan Kazemi not soon to walk into Matt Knight, I wonder what direction these Ducks will take?",

legalised.\n\nOrganisers of the demonstration say they are prepared to flout current laws – and smoke the banned drug in front of police.\n\nThey claim at least 200 supporters will attend the event which has much support in across the West Midlands where one house in every three streets grows cannabis .\n\nBirmingham Cannabis Club says so far 134 people have confirmed that they will be joining them in Birmingham’s most popular park, which is next door to West Midlands Police training headquarters Tally Ho!\n\nAnd many more have pledged support on the club’s Facebook page for the protest on Saturday August 31 from 1pm.\n\nOrganiser Matt Towers said: “The whole point of doing this is to raise awareness that cannabis does have significant therapeutic values for medical conditions, but also we believe strongly that people shouldn’t be made into criminals for something that is a personal choice.\n\n“We’re not asking to be allowed to go walking down the street smoking a big joint, we’re just asking to be left alone in the privacy of our own homes.\n\n“Cannabis has been used during the past 10,000 years for clothing, paper, food, plastics... and there is significant research to suggest it can help with lots of medical conditions, including cancer, HIV, depression and more.\n\n“People are welcome to come and smoke, but we’re adamant that there will not be any dealing.\n\n“We don’t promote cannabis use, we promote freedom of choice.”\n\nBut Birmingham City Councillor Deidre Alden (Con, Edgbaston) is among those opposing the campaign.\n\nShe said: “There are quite a few dangers surrounding this drug.\n\n“Firstly, cannabis use can lead users on to other drugs, including some of the most harmful Class A illicit substances.\n\n“Secondly, people can have mental health issues as a result of using cannabis and thirdly, because it is illegal it brings people into contact with drug dealers and that whole underground world.\n\n“I hope that police will take the strongest action possible at this protest.”\n\nWest Midlands Police have set up a specialist Cannabis Disposal Team, dedicated to dismantling drugs farms.\n\nSince its launch in October 2010, the team has recovered more than £22 million worth of the drug in the West Midlands.\n\nSuperintendent Alison Telford said “We are aware that this event is being advertised online – however we haven’t been contacted by the organisers to notify us of their plans.\n\n“We are currently working with the council and the park to gather as much information as possible and we are also trying to trace the organisers to discuss our concerns about this event with them.\n\n“Possessing these kinds of recreational drugs is illegal and anyone found to be breaking the law will be dealt with accordingly.”\n\nBirmingham City Council, which owns Cannon Hill Park, has previously said that to earlier cannabis protests planned at the venue were ‘inappropriate’.\n\nBut the local authority has declined to comment on the latest event.\n\nThe organisers have already held protests on the Malvern Hills and in Colwick Park in Nottingham, this year.\n\nThey are hoping to lure in more supporters handing out information leaflets about the alleged medical benefits of taking cannabis on the day, guest speakers, music and merchandise giveaways.\n\nThey said the event is part of a wider ‘normalisation movement’ being led by the United Kingdom Cannabis Social Club, which has around 40 off-shoot groups including Birmingham Cannabis Club.\n\nBut previous pro-cannabis events in Cannon Hill Park have proven a bit of a damp squib.\n\nA planned protest inviting people to smoke cannabis at the city’s most popular park in 2007 failed to take place.\n\nIt was originally listed on the council’s What’s On Page under the alias ‘Smokey Bear’, but embarrassed bosses swiftly removed it after being told what it stood for by a newspaper reporter.\n\nA council spokeswoman said at the time: “We do not consider this unauthorised gathering to be an appropriate use of a public park and have not agreed for it to take place at Cannon Hill.”\n\nAnd a festival which was expected to draw crowds of more than 200 to Cannon Hill Park in 2004 was said to have gone to pot when just one person showed up.\n\nCannabis and the law\n\nCannabis is the most widely used illegal drug in Britain, according to NHS Choices.\n\nIt is also known as marijuana, weed, hash, draw, blow, puff, ganja, spliff, skunk, pot, herb and black grass.\n\nIt was downgraded to a Class C drug in 2004 under Tony Blair’s Labour government but was reclassified as a Class B drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971 in 2009 when Gordon Brown was Prime Minister.\n\nThe maximum penalty for supplying [dealing] or producing cannabis is 14 years imprisonment and/or an unlimited fine.\n\nAnyone found with the drug in their possession could face jail sentences from two to five years.\n\nA new ‘escalation’ penalty system for cannabis possession means that the penalty issued is directly related to the number of times an individual has previously been caught in possession of the drug.\n\nIf an adult is caught in possession of cannabis:\n\n1. for the first time – they will be issued with a cannabis warning.\n\n2. for the second time – they will receive a Penalty Notice for Disorder (PND) for cannabis possession, which carry an £80 on-the-spot fine.\n\n3. for the third time – police officers will consider further action, including release without charge, caution, conditional caution or prosecution.\n\n4. any additional times – According to government statements ‘all subsequent offences are likely to result in arrest’.\n\nRecreational drugs are illegal in the Netherlands, but there is an official policy of tolerance and thousands of tourists visit Amsterdam each year to sample cannabis in the city’s famous coffee shops.\n\nCannabis is legal in some states in America for medicinal purposes.",

Both insisted \"this is not a partisan issue.\"\n\n\"What we are saying the Constitution is being violated,\" said Racine.\n\nThe suit alleges that Trump has violated the Emoluments Clause in the Constitution which states that \"no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State.\"\n\nRelated: Trump Failing to Track Foreign Cash at His Hotels\n\n\"President Trump's continued ownership interest in a global empire, which renders him deeply enmeshed with a legion of foreign and domestic government actors, violates the Constitution and calls into question the rule of law and the integrity of the country’s political system, “ the suit, which was filed in U.S. District Court in Greenbelt, Maryland, states.\n\n“And irrespective of whether such benefits affect the President’s decision-making or shift his foreign or domestic policy, uncertainty about whether the President is acting in the best interest of the American people, or rather for his own ends or personal enrichment, inflicts lasting harm on our democracy.\"\n\n“The emoluments clauses are a firewall against corruption,” said Frosh. “We understand the president understands the value of walls. This is one thing he can’t climb over and he can’t dig underneath.”\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump signs Executive Orders in the Hall of Heroes at the Pentagon on Jan. 27, 2017 in Arlington. File Olivier Douliery / EPA File\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Sean Spicer insisted Trump's \"interests do not violate the Emoluments Clause\" and said partisan politics in behind this lawsuit.\n\n\"It’s not hard to conclude that partisan politics may be one of the motivations behind this,\" Spicer said Monday. \"The suit was filed by two Democratic attorney generals. The lawyers driving the suit are advocacy group with partisan ties.\"\n\nThe Republican National Committee called the lawsuit \"absurd\".\n\n“From day one, President Trump has been committed to complete transparency and compliance with the law,\" RNC spokeswoman Lindsay Jancek said in a statement. \"The actions of the attorneys general represent the kind of partisan grandstanding voters across the country have come to despise. The American people elected President Trump to lead this country, and it is time Democrats end their efforts to delegitimize his presidency.”\n\nIn the past Trump has said he would put their reins of his businesses in the hands of his sons and that nobody cares about his taxes.\n\nThis is the first lawsuit filed by government entities against Trump's business interests. It has been assigned to Judge Peter Messitte, an appointee of former president Bill Clinton.\n\nCitizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a nonprofit activist group, has separately sued Trump in U.S. District Court in Manhattan alleging \"countless conflicts of interest\" in violation of the Constitution's so-called emoluments clause.\n\nIn January, Trump promised to track and donate all profits from foreign government travel and commerce at his companies to the U.S. Treasury. But NBC News and MSNBC reported last month that the Trump Organization hasn't been tracking all possible payments it receives from foreign governments.\n\nCompany policy detailed in a new pamphlet suggests that it is up to foreign governments, not Trump's hotels, to determine whether foreign governments self-report their business dealings.\n\n\"To attempt to individually track and distinctly attribute certain business-related costs as specifically identifiable to a particular customer group is not practical,\" the pamphlet states.",

Congressional Research Service Summary Title I: Strengthening National Preparedness and Response for Public Health Emergencies Amends the Public Health Service Act (PHSA) to require the Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) to submit the National Health Security Strategy to the relevant congressional committees in 2014. Revises the Strategy's preparedness goals, in part to specify that the drills and exercises included in periodic evaluations of federal, state, local, and tribal preparedness and response capabilities also include drills and exercises to ensure medical surge capacity for events without notice. Requires the Strategy to include: (1) provisions for increasing the preparedness, response capabilities, and surge capacity of ambulatory care facilities, dental health facilities, and critical care service systems; (2) plans for optimizing a coordinated and flexible approach to the medical surge capacity of hospitals, other health care facilities, critical care, and trauma care and emergency medical systems; (3) provisions taking into account the unique needs of individuals with disabilities in a public health emergency; and (4) strategic initiatives to advance countermeasures to diagnose, mitigate, prevent, or treat harm from any biological agent or toxin or any chemical, radiological, or nuclear agent or agents, whether naturally occurring, unintentional, or deliberate. Requires the Secretary to: (1) monitor emerging issues and concerns as they relate to medical and public health preparedness and response for at-risk individuals in the event of a public health emergency; (2) disseminate and update novel and best practices of outreach to and care of at-risk individuals before, during, and following public health emergencies in as timely a manner as is practicable, including from the time a public health threat is identified; and (3) ensure that public health and medical information distributed by HHS during a public health emergency is delivered in a manner that takes into account the range of communication needs of the intended recipients, including at-risk individuals.\n\nTitle II: Optimizing State and Local All-Hazards Preparedness and Response Allows the Secretary to authorize a state or tribe to temporarily reassign state and local public health department or agency personnel funded through PHSA programs to immediately address a public health emergency in the state or tribe. Requires such reassignments to be voluntary. Requires GAO to evaluate such temporary reassignments. Terminates this temporary reassignment authority on September 30, 2018. Reauthorizes the Emergency System for Advance Registration of Health Professions Volunteers (ESAR-VHP) for FY2014-FY2018, which provides a single national interoperable network of systems to verify the credentials and licenses of health care professionals who volunteer to provide health services during a public health emergency. Reauthorizes for FY2014-FY2018 the Medical Reserve Corps to provide for an adequate supply of volunteers in the case of a public health emergency. Requires training exercises to incorporate the needs of at-risk individuals in the event of such an emergency. Revises and reauthorizes appropriations for FY2014-FY2018 for a program of grants and cooperative agreements to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness.\n\nTitle III: Enhancing Medical Countermeasure Review Amends the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to revise requirements for special protocol assessments to include agreements on the design and size of animal and any associated clinical trials which, in combination, are intended to form the primary basis of an effectiveness claim for a countermeasure or epidemic or pandemic product when human efficacy studies are not ethical or feasible. Revises the Secretary's authority to allow the use of unapproved medical products or the unapproved use of an approved product. Authorizes the Secretary to make a declaration that the circumstances exist justifying such an authorization and base the determination on: (1) a (general) threat (rather than a specific threat as under current law), (2) a significant potential for a public health emergency, (3) the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad, and (4) the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security. Eliminates the one-year expiration date for such an authorization (thus allowing it to continue). Authorizes the Secretary to permit deviations from good manufacturing practice requirements when the circumstances of a domestic, military, or public health emergency or material threat so warrant. Authorizes the Secretary to waive prescription requirements during an emergency and create and issue emergency use instructions to inform health care providers or individuals to whom an eligible product is to be administered concerning the product's approved, licensed, or cleared conditions. Authorizes the Secretary to waive requirements for a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy in the event of a domestic, military, or public health emergency (currently, such waiver authority applies only to a public health emergency) or the identification of a material threat sufficient to affect national security or the health and security of U.S. citizens abroad.\n\nTitle IV: Accelerating Medical Countermeasure Advanced Research and Development Authorizes the Secretary to enter into contracts and other agreements that are in the government's best interest in meeting identified security countermeasure needs, including reimbursement of the cost of advanced research and development as a reasonable, allowable, and allocable direct cost of the contract involved. Reauthorizes appropriations for FY2014-FY2018 for the Special Reserve Fund for procurement of security countermeasures and for countermeasure advanced research and development under Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority (BARDA). Prohibits the Secretary from utilizing more than 50% of such amount for research and development. Requires the Secretary to report to the appropriate congressional committees if the amount in the Fund falls below a specified threshold. Revises and reauthorizes for FY2014-FY2018 the Biodefense Medical Countermeasure Development Fund used to support BARDA to accelerate countermeasure and product advanced research and development. Authorizes the Secretary to support innovation under BARDA by promoting dose sparing technologies, efficacy increasing technologies, and platform technologies. Requires the Secretary to provide a clear statement of defined government purpose related to BARDA activities for the awarding of contracts, grants, and cooperative agreements for a qualified countermeasure or qualified pandemic or epidemic product. Extends the antitrust exemption to permit meetings and consultations to discuss the development of security countermeasures, qualified countermeasures, or qualified pandemic or epidemic products. Reauthorizes the Strategic National Stockpile for FY2014-FY2018.\n\nNote: Much more detail provided at Congressional Research Service Summary link above. CBO Estimate, dated 2/21/13.\n\nH.R. 307 would amend the Public Health Service Act and the United States Code to authorize funding for certain activities carried out by the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Veterans Affairs (VA) that would support the readiness of the public health system to address public health and medical emergencies. Based on information provided by HHS and VA, CBO estimates that implementing the act would cost about $11 billion over the 2014-2018 period, assuming the appropriation of the authorized amounts. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2012, included funding totaling about $2 billion in fiscal year 2012 for activities similar to those that would be authorized by H.R. 307. CBO assumes that amounts appropriated through the Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2013, for those activities are similar to 2012 levels. H.R. 307 also would change the terms for Project Bioshield contracts, which would result in a change in direct spending. Assuming H.R. 307 is enacted this spring, it would decrease direct spending by $58 million over the 2013-2018 period, but would result in no net change in direct spending over the 2013-2023 period.

  "latent_17407": "“Existence without self-exploration is torture, and not the good kind.” That could easily be the text on a BDSM-themed inspirational poster, but it’s a written response from New Jersey grind collective Pink Mass. If you’ve caught any of their live rituals since the release of their SLVT KVLT EP, you’ve seen Pink Mass banging out their uncompromising grind/punk in leather gear and gimp masks. Despite titles like “Bestial Sodomizers” and “Craving Asphyxiation,” Pink Mass aren’t some shock rock shit-stirrers content with offending delicate sensibilities. Pink Mass promote complete “freedom and liberation” through a lens of hedonism and progressive thought.\n\nNecrosexual —their debut LP out on Halloween— bludgeons with hardcore punk vitriol after its horror soundtrack intro. “Dismal Violator” teases with a melodic riff before erupting into blastbeats and breakdowns that scorch the earth. Before you can gang-shout “nail-impaled phallus,” the relentless sludge of “Crypt Perversor” relents to a fiery thrash passage. Necrosexual‘s bombast reaches nearly every corner of extreme music, from raw death (“Extinction of the Breeders”), to blackened doom (“FOAD NSBM”), and even macabre synthwave. But ultimately it’s Necrosexual‘s grindcore propulsion that fuels the record’s momentum up to the haunting outro.\n\nBuckle your bullet belt and tighten your sex harness before streaming Necrosexual below. Also check out the band’s thoughts on hedonism, Satanism, and how “feeble-minded alt-Righters” react to their live performances. But first, it’s time for some Necrosexual healing.\n\nPink Mass and Necrosexual focus primarily on sexual liberation. How closely do you think sexual repression and destructive/self-destructive behavior are linked?\n\nPink Mass: Extremely! Sexual oppression leads to defense mechanisms, and unhealthy coping with feelings of shame and guilt. Religious sects who practice forms of sexual repression have repeatedly had members act out in harmful ways to themselves and others. For example, a person who represses their sexual desires due to their own religious beliefs or societal pressures can feel self-hate or a need to hide their true self. Pink Mass aims to free people of those burdens through self-revelation and a sexual awakening. We support that pursuit of pleasure as long as it doesn’t harm themselves or others.\n\nIf there was a Venn diagram showing shared values of Hedonism and Satanism, I think it would center on pleasure, satisfaction, and indulgence. To you, what are the most important components of Hedonism and Satanism as philosophies?\n\nPM: In a Biblical sense, Satanism, at its core, is defiance. Defiance and blasphemy are key components of our pansexual agenda. In its political manifestation, Satanism has given an alternative to the social norm, which we, as Pink Mass, try to present through defiling the constraints of the modern-day metal movement. Individualism, or respecting oneself as an individual, no matter how you label yourself, is another radical component that we admire heavily.\n\nAs for hedonism, it connects to Satanism’s individualism based on the pursuit of your pleasure with the removal of any guilt or judgment. These feelings are not fueled by us as individuals, they are internalized from the societal and religious indoctrination of our larger society. Participation in Satanism and Hedonism, then, is blasphemous at its core in its rejection of norms.\n\nThe modern-day Satanic movement advocates for the mockery of religion and cult mentality in general. When we say Slvt Kvlt, we don’t see ourselves as a cult hailing to any tyrannical rule or authority because being a slut is being free, partaking in whatever consensual satisfaction you desire.\n\nNecrosexual has some interesting departures from your grind/punk attack, like the synth intro and outro, and an interlude that reminds me of something that would be on a Dystopia record. Together, they give the record a horror vibe. What personally scares you or makes you uneasy?\n\nPM: Existence without self-exploration is torture, and not the good kind. There is a plethora of things that scare us, but not experiencing any of them is even scarier. On a lighter note, plenty of other things scare us, the usual… heights, small spaces, STD test results… big penises, little penises, most human contact. Being fake. I’m sure there is more but we’re scared to reveal them in case our enemies are reading this.\n\nI know you’ve played a bunch of shows in NYC and elsewhere. How do crowds seem to react before the music starts, and after? Have you been confronted by any squares who aren’t ready to get shredded by a group of Militant Necrosexual Satanic Hedonists?\n\nPM: We thrive off the look of repugnance and shock from the typical knuckle-dragging death metal fan to the discomfort of the reclusive black metal elitist having their first sexual awakening. But we usually win the crowd over after their first waves of shock. On the other hand, there have been occasions where feeble-minded alt-Righters fall too far down the rabbit hole of idiocy to be smitten with us, but even they dream of us in their darkest desires, so we have ultimately conquered that ignorant and unworthy bunch with our hymns of sonic filth and perversity. There are still the occasions where people misread what agenda we put forth due to the representations of sex in metal. They see a bunch of burly men squeezed into too-small latex and leather and expect us to sing songs about the typical sex, drugs, and rock and roll that has lost all sense of rebellion in this day and age. We stand for freedom and liberation and are prepared to despoil and mince all that stand in our path to sexual apotheosis.\n\nDo you have upcoming shows scheduled to support the release? What else is planned for the rest of 2017 and beyond?\n\nPM: 2018 is looking like it’s going to be huge. We’re going to head out west for Famine Fest in Portland in March and probably have short tour with our butt-buddies GUN (definitely check them out if you’re into raw hardcore punk). After that we’re looking to get on Obscene Extreme in Czech Republic with New Jersey’s other premier grind band, and our childhood friends, Organ Dealer! Hopefully we’ll have a tour attached to that as well. As for back home, we’ve gotten our first show post-digital release at Matchless in Brooklyn with Organ Dealer and Brain Famine. We’re definitely going to set up a proper release show once we have the vinyl in our filthy hands.\n\nJoin the Pink Mass slvt kvlt over on Facebook HERE.\n\nAnd go spend your bad habit money on the Pink Mass discography over on Bandcamp HERE.",

They're looking for something really unique and fun.\"\n\nAnd while there are a number of exceptions, including the company's Maple Leaf Gardens store in downtown Toronto, \"a lot of their other stores are . . . kind of looking and feeling a bit dated.\"\n\n\"There (also) seems to be a current trend in Canada and in the United States for smaller, neighbourhood stores and I think Loblaws is kind of stuck with a few too many superstores,\" he added.\n\nOn the Toronto Stock Exchange, Loblaw shares were up 78 cents, or 2.3 per cent, at $34.66 in early afternoon trading Tuesday.",

Granted, Sprint and T-Mobile have themselves to blame for the outcome of that hugely important spectrum auction since they didn’t make bids in it, but it’s also the case that the smaller carriers are financially outgunned by the wireless industry’s two biggest players. Now the two carriers are teaming up with Dish, several rural wireless carriers and public interest groups such as Public Knowledge to make sure history doesn’t repeat itself with the upcoming auction for spectrum on the 600MHz band.\n\nRELATED: Sprint and T-Mobile have no future unless the FCC changes its approach to spectrum auctions\n\nThe coalition of carriers has launched a new website called Save Wireless Choice where they advocate that the government take steps to make sure AT&T and Verizon don’t once again grab all the most valuable 600MHz spectrum. In essence, here are their demands:\n\nNo more delays for the spectrum auction . Both AT&T and Verizon recently spent big on the AWS-3 spectrum auction and they’re hoping for some delays to the 600MHz auction so they can reload their budgets to spend more on spectrum.

We relive that evening 18 years ago, through the eyes of goalscorer David Kelly, Republic of Ireland manager Jack Charlton, former England defender Gary Pallister, Irish Times football correspondent Emmet Malone, Ireland fan Dennis O'Connor and Bernard O'Byrne, who was in charge of security on the night.\n\nBUILD-UP\n\nDavid Kelly (DK): \"I was so pleased, not only to be in the squad, but to be actually starting. We had such good strikers, so playing time was at a premium for me. And to play against England at Lansdowne Road was absolutely brilliant.\n\nThey had such a strong team and we had some fantastic players in our squad, so it was a super fixture. Obviously everything connected with England and Ireland added a little bit more spice to the game.\n\nThe political situation wasn't mentioned within the squad though. Jack Charlton was purely all about the football. He won the World Cup with England, but was our national manager and wanted to win. The team bus was the usual jovial place to be. On the way through the streets, we had tremendous support as normal. I don't recall anyone mentioning the potential for trouble.\"\n\nJack Charlton (JC): \"My son Peter had travelled over on the boat from Liverpool for the game, and I remember him telling me he'd had trouble with England fans who had found out who he was. It was an ugly incident and he'd been frightened. That wasn't nice and it wasn't normal for something like that to happen before a game. So I suppose there had been a bit of an unpleasant atmosphere around.\"\n\nGary Pallister (GP): \"We were up to speed with things that were happening in Ireland at the time. We were aware of the environment that existed and the fact it was a powder keg. We didn't expect anything to happen in the game though, because you always think the police and security will be able to keep things under control. The journey over to Ireland and the stay at the hotel were all pretty normal and there wasn't any abuse as we travelled from the hotel to the stadium. When we got to Lansdowne Road, I was just concentrating on the game and my own performance. Ireland had caused England a lot of problems in the past and we knew a lot of their players from the Premier League. We were also coming up to a big tournament in our own country and everyone was desperate to be in the squad for Euro '96. I just wanted to impress and try to get a place in that squad. I thought the boss, Terry Venables, was one of the best managers we ever had - a great man-manager, tactician and coach - and the England squad was a very enjoyable place to be at that time. We all wanted to be involved.\"\n\nEmmet Malone (EM): \"It would have been foolish to assume there wouldn't be trouble, with the history of the games between the teams and everything that went with it, in terms of the political situation and the profile of the fans that were travelling. There had been a lot done on the British police's part in terms of looking at who was travelling to games. The Gardai [Irish police] would have been absolutely briefed and I think the general expectation would have been that it was a serious possibility. There were large numbers of police, significantly more than would have been present at a normal friendly game.\"\n\nDennis O'Connor (DOC): \"I was 12 years old at the time and was quite excited about the game. I had been going to Lansdowne Road for about six years, but it was the first time I'd been at a floodlit game there, so that added to the atmosphere.\"\n\nBernard O'Byrne (BOB): \"We had a lot of meetings with the Gardai and English FA before the match. We expected a small amount of dubious fans to come from England and we had three or four times the amount of meetings and preparations and rehearsals that we would have had before any other match. There had been some tension before - we expected some kind of incident - but we still expected a good sporting occasion.\"\n\nCLOSE TO KICK-OFF\n\nEM: As I arrived in the stadium, the atmosphere in the place wasn't great. There was a sense that the English fans that came over were a little more hard core. They were all corralled into an upper part of the West Stand, which was a strange place for them to be. It certainly wasn't the friendliest of atmospheres. \"\n\nDOC: We got into the ground about 15 minutes before kick-off. It was extremely noisy. It was the best atmosphere I had experienced. I went with my dad and he had said to me that there might be trouble, so it was in the back of my mind. But there were no incidents on the way to the ground.\"\n\nDK: \"We went out and warmed up. It was a very vociferous greeting for both teams. You could see the section of England fans over in that top block and we were all aware of where they were sitting, but I didn't feel like there were going to be any problems. I was aware that there was booing throughout the anthems, but never did I think that (trouble) would kick off as it did.\"\n\nGAME STARTS\n\n1995 teams Republic of Ireland: Alan Kelly, Denis Irwin, Terry Phelan, Alan Kernaghan, Paul McGrath, Eddie McGoldrick, Andy Townsend (captain, inset), David Kelly, Niall Quinn, John Sheridan, Steve Staunton\n\nAlan Kelly, Denis Irwin, Terry Phelan, Alan Kernaghan, Paul McGrath, Eddie McGoldrick, Andy Townsend (captain, inset), David Kelly, Niall Quinn, John Sheridan, Steve Staunton England: David Seaman, Warren Barton, Graeme Le Saux, Paul Ince, Tony Adams, Gary Pallister, David Platt (captain), Peter Beardsley, Alan Shearer, Matt Le Tissier, Darren Anderton\n\nThe match kicks off at 18:15 and the atmosphere in the stands is tense, after some of the home and travelling fans drown out the national anthems with boos and whistles. Some of the England fans chant: \"No surrender to the IRA\".\n\nDK: We started the game very brightly. I remember I had a couple of half chances I thought I could have done a little better with.\n\nGOAL:John Sheridan picks the ball up in midfield and threads it through to Wolves striker Kelly, who runs onto it on the left hand-side of the box and shoots across England goalkeeper David Seaman into the far corner of the net.\n\nDK: \"It was a bit of a miss-hit, but fortunately it bounced along the side of the goal and went just across the top of David Seaman's arm. I was absolutely delighted it had gone in and I remember celebrating in the far corner with the lads.\"\n\nTROUBLE BEGINS\n\nDK: As we were jogging back, we quickly realised there were a few things going on. Very quickly it became apparent that lots of things were being thrown onto the pitch.\n\nJC: \"I didn't realise there was any trouble at first, because I had my back to what was going on. Then I stood up and looked back at the stand behind me. There were people standing up and throwing bottles, seats, anything they could get hold of, and the people in the tier below were pouring forward to avoid being hit.\"\n\nEM: \"When I tried to walk around to where the English fans were, there were a considerable number of police there. They were embroiled in what was already developing into a pitched battle and were trying to establish more of a presence on the upper deck of the stand. There were Irish fans coming out looking a bit battered and very frightened. There were some English fans coming out too, but a hard core of English fans were in full flight at that stage.\"\n\nDOC: \"It was mayhem, just carnage really. I was numb and in shock watching it. You were wondering if seats were going to hit people. You didn't know if people were being assaulted. A bit of fright set in then. There were about 100 England fans down our end, who were penned in at the side of the North Terrace towards the West Stand, and I could hear people around me saying they were rushing towards us.\"\n\nGAME STOPPED AND PLAYERS TAKEN OFF THE PITCH\n\nMissiles were thrown down from the West Stand at Lansdowne Road\n\nGP: \"After going one-nil down, I saw seats being thrown onto the pitch, which is something that lives long in your memory. I could see trouble just escalating after that. Pretty soon the referee decided it was in the best interests of everyone to take the teams off. Someone could have been seriously hurt and it was not a very nice sight or situation.\"\n\nDK: \"By then, lots of seats were being thrown and we were very quickly ushered into the dressing rooms. It was purely a case of getting off the pitch and hoping that the Gardai could contain the situation and calm everything down.\"\n\nMATCH ABANDONED\n\nAbout 12 minutes after the game was stopped, it is announced it has been abandoned.\n\nGP: \"Security and police came in to inform us what was happening. They asked whether we would feel happy going back out into that kind of environment. The general consensus among the players was that it probably wasn't the best thing to do. That would have probably caused more trouble and made things even worse.\"\n\n\"They were acting in animal-like behaviour and couldn't have cared less if they'd killed someone that night\" - Bernard O'Byrne\n\nJC: \"People were coming forward onto the pitch to get away from the trouble, some of them with bloodied heads. The scenes reminded me of the Hillsborough disaster at first, if I'm honest. I'd been at that game and the people pouring onto the pitch reminded me of that terrible day. It was chaos, mayhem, and I feared the worst. The referee called the game off. He had no other option.\"\n\nDK: \"In the dressing room, there was a reaction of shock, because this type of thing happens very rarely in football. It was definitely the first time it had happened to me. We were then told that the game was abandoned and to get showered and that we were all going back to the hotel. At no stage did any of the players think it was going to be as bad as it was. From the moment we were back in the dressing room, nobody thought that it was going to end up with iron bars being thrown onto the pitch and people being injured.\"\n\nDOC: \"There was quite a lot of panic. As soon as the stadium announcer said the game had been called off, we just left straight away. As we were leaving, there was pandemonium and extreme panic in the tunnel at the back of the terrace. My dad and I just ran through the tunnel. There were shouts and screams from people trying to get out of there. We just kept running until we were well clear of the ground. There were at least a couple of hundred other people sprinting out as well.\"\n\nBOB: \"I remember thinking my family was sitting up in the West Stand where this was happening - my daughter, my wife, my sister, my nephews. I remember some very brave individual Gardai and some security guys who were confronting what I described at the time - and I think it's still appropriate - this kind of sub-species of people who were acting in animal-like behaviour and couldn't have cared less if they'd killed someone that night. And there were some very brave individuals who maintained a barrier until the riot squad eventually arrived and half-retrieved the situation.\"\n\nAFTERMATH\n\nJC: \"My feelings turned from concern to anger. I was furious about what had happened. It was a game of football and a few silly buggers had turned it into this. I remember getting on the pitch and telling the troublemakers to 'get home' and telling the police 'get them home'. I was furious, but there was nothing I could do about it.\"\n\n\" I remember getting on the pitch and telling the troublemakers to 'get home'\" - Jack Charlton\n\nDK: \"When we got back to the hotel, we put the news on and saw exactly what was going on. We reacted with bewilderment, disbelief and sadness that these fools had caused the stoppage of the game.\"\n\nGP: \"You go there and train and prepare and expect to play 90 minutes. But there was hardly time to get a sweat on, all because of a few idiots. I was disappointed and gutted that a game of football could turn into that kind of environment. To be honest, I'd felt more disappointed than frightened. In the end I didn't make the Euros because of injury, which was a massive blow, as I felt we had a real shot.\"\n\nEM: \"What was striking was how badly organised it was. The England fans weren't in any way contained. Many of the Irish fans were shocked and very frightened by what happened. The fact that the English fans were placed over Irish supporters meant that there were very fundamental mistakes made and I found that really surprising. The FAI (Football Association of Ireland) seemed happy enough to put it down to the English fans. [Their] attitude was very much that the Gardai had been responsible for the security arrangements. The Gardai certainly didn't see that they were to blame, so there was just this attitude that English fans were uncontainable and that Irish governing bodies and security forces just weren't used to that sort of thing.\"\n\nDOC: \"I'll never forget it. I've been to well over 100 Ireland games and that one sticks out in my mind. It's awful to think back on it. There were obviously a large number of England fans involved, but I'm sure there were also genuine England fans who ended up getting caught up in it.\"\n\nBOB: \"We were very lucky to get away with it. As bad as it was, we're very, very lucky that no-one was killed that night.\"\n\nIn April 1995, a public inquiry by former Irish chief justice Thomas Finlay concluded the violence had been caused by English fans without provocation. He also said, however, the trouble could have been avoided had the Irish police acted on information about Combat 18 travelling to Ireland and accepted assistance from the National Criminal Intelligence Service in Britain.\n\nWEMBLEY 2013 MATCH\n\nEM: \"It has taken a long time for the two countries to face each other again. These are special games. Even in the most sporting sense, England are 'the old enemy' and that's why we hope that - despite the fact that our team is relatively lowly ranked and have far less ability than the England team on the face of it - our players will rise to the occasion. I would be surprised if there was significant difficulty at a game like this in Wembley. Having said that, it's impossible to rule it out.\"\n\nGP: \"A lot has changed since 1995 and I don't foresee the same thing happening again. This is a great game to be involved in. Ireland have made England come unstuck a few times and it will be a good test for Roy Hodgson's men, different from playing most other European teams.\"\n\nDK: \"The Irish supporters will support the team vociferously, as they should do, and we all hope and pray that there are no unsavoury scenes. There's always a slight concern though. We'd be foolish to think there might not be certain issues, but I'm sure the police in Ireland and the UK will have a huge dossier, and we hope that there will be no difficulties and it's a good game of football.\"\n\nDOC: \"I'm going to Wembley with my Dad again. It's 18 years since we've played each other and I miss the fixtures between the two sides. Even though it was a horrible night looking back, there is still a big rivalry and any time we're playing England, it's a massive occasion.\"",
  "latent_17546": "This article originally appeared on VICE Canada.\n\nWhen Jon Bernthal returns to Netflix later this month in The Punisher, he'll be walking down a well-worn path. The superhero-movie industry likes to paint itself as risk-averse, but somehow the Marvel antihero has been given room to fail on the big screen three times before his well-received supporting role in Daredevil. Now that he's the headliner again, it's worth looking back on one of those failed attempts, one of Marvel Studios' best and most under-appreciated films: 2008's Punisher: War Zone.\n\nComing out the same year as the inaugural Avengers titles Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk, War Zone was part of the first batch of Marvel films made in-house (unlike those two, however, the Punisher character rights belonged to Lionsgate, which financed the movie in partnership with Marvel).\n\nWho owns what in Marvel's stable of characters is an ongoing source of convoluted relationships between films; rather than being part of Marvel's \"Phase One,\" War Zone was produced as part of an aborted side project called Marvel Knights. Like the whole Marvel Knights imprint, War Zone was quietly written out of canon after terrible reviews and subpar box-office earnings. Its fate was all but cemented when Marvel recast titular actor Ray Stevenson in the Thor films before the Punisher's official reboot in Daredevil.\n\nLooking back, War Zone has all the hallmarks of the kind of movie superhero fans are always asking for. It's still the only Marvel film helmed by a woman, Lexi Alexander, making its casual dismissal all the more annoying.\n\nWhat's more, War Zone has the hard R-rating of Deadpool and Logan, with the pitch-black humor of the former. These are important points of comparison. Marvel's in-house productions are overseen by Disney, and their kid-friendly lightheartedness doesn't hide their provenance.\n\nFOX got a lot of attention with its edgier, adult-oriented X-Men spinoffs. The two films are already fan favorites in the superhero genre, and that little capital R on the posters is at least partially to than—Deadpool was especially successfully, briefly holding the record for the biggest single-day opening of an R-rated film. Marvel has been cagey about the prospect of R-rated Avengers titles, but this success can't have gone unnoticed. Kevin Feige, president of Marvel Studios, has recently become publicly more open to the idea, marking a change from earlier Disney statements.\n\nWar Zone's nostalgia and playful sense of (dark) humor similarly taps into some of what makes more recent Marvel titles feel fresh and exciting, in that peculiarly contemporary recycled way. It's a throwback to 80s action movies—maybe more violent than Guardians of the Galaxy, but playing in the same ballpark of nostalgic references. That's a strategy that seems to be working, with the most recent film Thor: Ragnarok getting praise for its Flash Gordon-y sense of classic sci-fi adventure (and 80s comic-book color palette).\n\nBut War Zone's tongue-in-cheek outdatedness and gallows humor seem to have been missed by critics who called it a \"monstrosity\" and an \"inane bloodfest.\" It's a film that shouldn't be read straight, but instead with an openness to lines like \"Fuck you, Castle, you fucking fuck!\"\n\nAdmittedly, Frank punching through a guy's face or driving a chair leg into someone's eye aren't the most whimsical of images, but you have to admire the absurdity of it all. It's the kind of ultra-violence that goes so far as to be funny. Even the coke-sniffing Italian mobsters standing in Frank's way are a trope so outdated as to feel like some kind of anarchic statement. Again, the parallels to Deadpool are important. Had War Zone been marketed with an emphasis on its comedy, like Deadpool, it may have paved the way for a more receptive audience.\n\nIn all fairness, there are plenty of valid reasons why people wouldn't love Marvel's bastard child, not least of which is that the character is always hard to root for. In short, Frank Castle is a simple character. His family was murdered, leaving him broken but with a mission to use his military training to take out criminals as the Punisher whenever he sees the justice system fail. Unlike other heroes, though, Frank is fine with just killing his marks (and those around them), removing a lot of the nuances and moral complexities of the superhero job.\n\nThat simplicity makes it hard to get Frank right, too, as was illustrated by the painfully awful Punisher films that preceded War Zone. The Punisher (1989), starring Dolph Lundgren in the title role, feels like an action B-movie cashing in on the successes of the bigger stars of its time, like Arnold Schwarzenegger and Bruce Willis. Thomas Jane (and his kitchen-sink dye job) is OK in 2004's The Punisher, but none of the supporting actors seem like they're acting in the same movie, making the whole thing feel tonally incoherent.\n\nDolph Lundgren and Thomas Jane, missing the mark in their own ways\n\nOf course fleshing out Frank's personality and motivations is a big risk. Frank's a monster who is sort of sometimes barely a good guy. The murder of his family is all the character development he ever needed, so thought bubbles and drawn-out monologues feel forced and function as hugely problematic justifications of his brutal vigilantism—they tend to spoil otherwise interesting comic-book iterations of the character and don't work any better when adapted to the screen.\n\nPunisher: War Zone, more than any other superhero movie, seems to get that this is the problem with the Punisher, if not every other superhero too. It doesn't waste any time giving us a glimpse into his mind, because what's the point? Frank is like the shark from Jaws. We need him to keep the tension up and the story moving forward, but it's how the characters around him react to him that really determines if a Punisher movie works or not.\n\nThat's what War Zone understands. It's not the most memorable film, and it's ridiculous on so many levels, but it doesn't stray from its purpose, namely having a one-man army take on New York's criminal underworld. Between shootouts, we see bumbling cops and cartoonishly evil mobsters try to figure out how to deal with Frank.\n\nThe moralizing that we usually find on the surface of other superhero movies is only implied here, and it's so much more compelling than elsewhere. There's little doubt that Frank is going about this the wrong way, so we're forced to question why he doesn't seem like more of a villain. And how different is he from the cops who more or less accept his MO? How broken is our system that when Frank scoffs at the idea of rehabilitation, he sounds just like a politician or police chief, albeit more direct about his scorn for the slow process of justice?\n\nThere's something almost refreshing about Frank's honesty, in a fucked-up way. He's a hopeless shell of a man who has given in to despair and is now defined by his compulsive need to lash out. He should be easy to dismiss as a villain, but the fact that both cops and the general public are on the fence about him is oddly believable. No other Punisher film, comic, or series that I've come across has managed to distill Frank as perfectly as War Zone has in this regard, and it does so while still being a fun shoot 'em up film.\n\nThe closest we come to Frank growing as a person is when he accidentally kills an undercover cop. This could have led to a hokey redemption arc, but it doesn't. Seeing the effect on the man's family leaves Frank questioning his mission, not because what he does is wrong but because he has become what he hates. It's a revealing bit of self-reflection that calls into question everything about the Punisher. His motive is absurd and selfish, and his reason for almost quitting is just as stupid. The simplicity of this broken man is suddenly laid bare.\n\nBernthal's take on Frank, to its credit, did work similarly well in Daredevil. Unlike Matt Murdock's horned hero, Frank isn't tormented by guilt or questions of right and wrong. Pitting the two of them against each other and pairing them as unlikely allies cranks up the drama without forcing the Punisher to get introspective or grow as a person.\n\nNow that he's going solo, things might get muddy again. Trailers give the impression that the Punisher series will focus on surveillance state overreaches and a conspiracy to silence Frank, who saw and participated in war crimes. These are interesting issues, but is the Punisher the right character for unpacking them? If he's morally torn when breaking the rules of war, how will he justify killing strangers without due process? And can any of us trust Marvel to know how to approach this?\n\nThe release of The Punisher was wisely pushed back after a heavily armed gunman opened fire on a crowd in Las Vegas last month. But the underlying philosophical problem with Frank Castle doesn't get any less complex after a few weeks' delay.\n\nThe Punisher should be a difficult character. In a broken system, he solves problems efficiently, but certainly, not justly, nor without innocent casualties. He's a good guy only insofar as his heart is in the right-ish place. It doesn't excuse him. As soon as we get too close, things start to get ugly. Let's hope he's kept at a safe distance now that he's the star again.\n\nFollow Frederick Blichert on Twitter.",

He surrendered his WBO welterweight title to Jeff Horn, in a controversial decision in Australia. He is considering a return to fighting in 2018.\n\nPacquiao told AFP that a fight between him and McGregor would be \"OK with both of us.\" That said, Pacquiao indicated talks have not progressed very far at this point.\n\n\"Initially, but we have not yet had any follow-ups,\" said Pacquiao, when asked if there has been communication between the two camps.\n\n\"It depends who they can finalize as my opponent by April.\"\n\nMcGregor's camp did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nManny Pacquiao, who serves as a senator in his native Philippines, said he would be able to fight in April when he has a break from his legislative duties. John Gurzinski/Getty Images\n\nAn April fight between Pacquiao (59-7-2, 28 KOs) and McGregor (21-3) would seem like a long shot -- although the same was said about McGregor's fight against Floyd Mayweather.\n\nMcGregor, 29, hasn't defended his UFC lightweight championship since winning it in November 2016, and UFC president Dana White repeatedly has stated he's looking forward to McGregor getting back into the Octagon.\n\nThe Irish star is still under exclusive UFC contract, however the two sides have been in talks recently to restructure his deal, per multiple sources.\n\nOn Saturday night after UFC Fight Night in Fresno, California, White was puzzled by Pacquiao's statements and even threatened legal action.\n\n\"That would be weird, because [Conor's] under contract with us,\" White said. \"If that's true, I will be suing Manny Pacquiao and whoever's representing him. So, I'm assuming that's not true.\"\n\nAt a previous media appearance in Las Vegas, White said there is still no guarantee McGregor ever will fight again -- in boxing or the UFC.\n\n\"We were working on a fight for him at the end of the year, and he's just not ready,\" White said.\n\n\"We're still in that 'Conor might never fight again' [phase]. The guy's got a f---ing $100 million,\" he said. \"I've got guys who have made less than that, who were lawyers their whole lives and quit working ... And fighting is the worst.

  "latent_17848": "\"The important thing to realize is that we're demonstrating quantum entanglement in an operational computer, not some lab experiment,\" said Colin Williams. \"It's a computer running software you'd be familiar with.\"\n\nWilliams is Director of Business Development at quantum computing company D-Wave Systems, as well as an author, researcher, and noted thinker in the field in his own right.\n\nThere's been a fair bit of quibbling among physics professionals as to whether D-Wave's computers are truly \"quantum,\" but experimental evidence discussed in a new paper seals the deal: D-Wave's computers are so quantum that they display \"entanglement,\" a weird characteristic of the subatomic world in which pairs of particles become \"related\" to each other — changing one of them instantly changes the other, even though they're separated by some distance.\n\n\"For the longest time people said entanglement was the gold standard — 'Until you show this, you don't have a quantum computer.' So this is a major step for the field as a whole,\" said Williams. \"I like to describe it in the context of the memory register of a [classical] computer. Whatever operation you perform doesn't have a side effect on the bits you don't touch, but quantum bits affect each other even though you didn't touch them.\"\n\nQuantum computers are those that draw their computational power from the quirks of the quantum world. Rather than using classical computer bits, which represent either a one or a zero and enable every single thing your computer does today, they use quantum bits (called qubits) that can represent a one, zero, or any value in between, all at once. This key difference grants quantum computers staggering capabilities to solve some of the stupid-hardest problems that would stump other computers.\n\nA qubit's ability to represent multiple values at the same time sounds counterintuitive, but it's completely scientific. The subatomic world plays by rules that are totally alien to us — particles disappear and reappear in different places, the same particle might exist in multiple places simultaneously, and it's hypothesized that quantum entanglement might soon have us sending and receiving information instantaneously across any distance. A qubit's curious properties are simply an extension of these quantum quirks.\n\nQuantum computers will prove themselves most useful in the arena of optimization. The go-to example of an optimization problem is that of a hypothetical traveling salesman who needs to visit several cities while traveling as short a distance as possible. Classical non-quantum computers can solve this quite inefficiently by way of brute force, chugging away for the optimal solution by manually checking every possible route configuration, then returning the shortest one. But a quantum computer can solve this problem as operationally as you might solve a basic addition problem — some speculate that the reason for this computational ease is because quantum computers are running calculations in alternate universes (!!!).\n\nMany fields need new ways of solving optimization problems. In pharmacology, researchers need to find drugs that can best bond with a complex molecule. With regard to artificial intelligence, a robot planning its path around a room is simply engaging in an optimization problem.\n\nAs Williams puts it, D-Wave is \"tapping into the fabric of reality to use quantum physical effects to computer in new ways.\" Now that the company's computers exhibit entanglement, it dramatically shortens the amount of time needed before quantum computing makes an impact on our lives.",
  "latent_18024": "As the parent of three daughters under the age of five, I've had growing anxiety about how to navigate our educational options.\n\nI live a few blocks from the Bishop Arts District in Oak Cliff, and there are several Dallas public elementary schools within a mile or so from my house. Rosemont Elementary is the popular choice, but we are a block outside the attendance boundary area, in the James Hogg Elementary zone.\n\nThe middle-class families in my neighborhood have for years exclusively chosen Rosemont, and those outside of the Rosemont boundary simply transferred. As a result, 76 percent of Rosemont's student body is low income, quite a bit lower than the district average of 89 percent. Hogg's student body is 95 percent low income.\n\nBut Bishop Arts' popularity in the past decade lead to an explosion of middle class families with young children. Suddenly Rosemont is unable to accommodate transfers, and families like mine must explore other options.\n\nWhile doing so, I came across research that concluded the one thing schools can do that has made a consistent difference in improving performance, that actually cut the achievement gap in half, was integration. Specifically, income integration. And yet it is rarely discussed or attempted.\n\nBut DISD leaders are aware of this and trying to do something about it. Last spring the district, led by Chief of Transformation and Integration Mike Koprowski, started some public conversations to actively woo the middle class back to Dallas public schools.\n\nI realized that the best thing I could do to support the elementary school in my neighborhood is to enroll my kids there. Not everyone thinks this is a good idea. If you think I'm experimenting with my children's future, you and my mother have that in common. But the research I've read in the past year indicates that my children will have success in life regardless of the schools they attend. Both my wife and I are college educated and we are comparatively upwardly mobile. And regrettably, those two factors are the biggest indicators of educational achievement in America today.\n\nSo with my oldest turning four in early June, we looked at registering for pre-kindergarten at Hogg. But it turns out that pre-K in DISD is only available to low-income or military families. The rationale for this is sound: with the current levels of funding, kids that are the most at-risk are given the highest priority. And yet Hogg is currently under 70 percent capacity, which means there will be empty seats in the pre-K classroom this year.\n\nSo I reached out to my trustee and to a few other DISD staff members to inquire about paying for a pre-K spot that would otherwise go unused. This had not been an option in DISD in the past, but given the rapid growth in our neighborhood, our proximity to downtown, and the amount of excess capacity at the school, Hogg seemed an ideal test case.\n\nA month later DISD rolled out a pilot program to test paid pre-K at five elementary school campuses, all north of Interstate-30. Two of the five have capacity ratings higher than 100 percent.\n\nClosing pre-K to middle class families poses a significant challenge to DISD, in my opinion. Most families I know with working parents need child care, and pre-K is a natural transition from daycare to school. If the most effective solution to DISD's underperformance is to attract the middle class back to public school, leaving them out of the on-ramp to elementary school seems like a significant oversight.\n\nThe problem is funding. The State of Texas has cut education funding to critical levels, and DISD has been forced to make cuts accordingly. There isn't enough money to do everything that the district needs to do, yet given the opportunity to present voters with the choice to raise property taxes to expand early childhood education and two other proven programs, the DISD board voted no.\n\nThere are good things happening at DISD. Schools are improving, and educational outcomes for kids who desperately need every opportunity are moving in the right direction at many schools. But only four out of 225 schools in the district are truly diverse in terms of socio-economic status (between 40 percent and 60 percent low-income) primarily because the middle class has abandoned DISD.\n\nI hope we can invest more time as a city understanding the impact concentrated poverty is having on our neighborhoods and our kids' education, and begin making conscious decisions to make it as easy for middle class families to opt back in to Dallas public schools.\n\nRob Shearer is a parent living in Oak Cliff.

  "latent_18250": "WITNESS Media Lab Videos of violence against transgender and gender nonconforming people is being filmed, shared and engaged with as entertainment.\n\nBy Karen Stevenson, program manager for the WITNESS Media Lab\n\nAgainst the backdrop of arguably the most noxious political cycle in U.S. history -- with a potential outcome that could undo decades of human rights progress -- November 1st marked the start of events and observances that will culminate this month with the Transgender Day of Resilience on the 19th and Transgender Day of Remembrance on the 20th.\n\nTo say that people who identify outside the gender binary are being targeted for abuse is an understatement. There has been a marked rise in hate violence with 23 transgender murders so far in 2016. The controversial trial for the 2013 brutal murder of Islan Nettles in New York City this year -- in which her assailant cited a “threat to his manhood” as the motivation for beating her to death on a Harlem street -- ended in a plea bargain. Not to mention the uncounted and unnamed transgender people who survive sexual assault, harassment, stalking, discrimination and bullying every day.\n\nCompounding these political, institutional, and social biases, is the fact that understanding and addressing the needs of transgender and gender nonconforming communities has been understudied because federal and other general population surveys that determine policy, social services and funding do not include questions about gender identity beyond the binary.\n\nAnd, being uncounted means being overlooked.\n\nIn response to this dearth of data, WITNESS -- an international organization that trains and supports people using video in their fight for human rights -- has released a report that explored the untapped potential of eyewitness video as a way to fill that gap.\n\nThe project, “Capturing Hate”, studied eyewitness videos of transphobic violence and the viewer engagement with them as a new and arguably more compelling source of data. The study found hundreds of videos made not with the intention of exposing or prosecuting abuse, but rather, content that is captured, shared, and engaged with as entertainment.\n\nShockingly, the 329 videos analyzed were viewed over 89 million times, shared over half a million times and rated favorably by 99% of the people who viewed them. Major brands have advertising adjacent to the content and 39% of videos found on YouTube were labeled as entertainment or comedy. Most alarming are the vitriolic comments and the ongoing engagement with the videos years after their original posting.\n\nWITNESS Media Lab Some of the startling engagement statistics on eyewitness videos of transphobic violence uploaded as entertainment.\n\nThe comments by viewers show a widespread sentiment of transphobia that not only condones violence, but actively encourages violent attacks against gender nonconforming people. In many of the videos bystanders can be heard cheering on the fights and shouting hate-filled epithets.\n\nThe goal of the report is to raise awareness of not only the videos, but to expose the social conditions that encourage these violent acts and bring accolades to filmers and commenters. Many of the videos include audio shout outs for the platforms that host them suggesting an accepted practice of bystander disregard and the presumed esteem in which capturing and sharing these videos is held.\n\nA trans friend of mine once told me that nearly every time they leave the house, they wonder if they’ll make it home alive. No one should have to live like that.\n\nI was moved to pursue this project, an initiative that started as a Media Lab Fellowship here at WITNESS, because I don’t think our country, our community, our colleagues fully understand the superhuman courage it takes for transgender people to be themselves in this world. I am humbled by their strength and resiliency. A trans friend of mine once told me that nearly every time they leave the house, they wonder if they’ll make it home alive. No one should have to live like that.\n\nWe believe this study tells the story of abuse suffered by transgender and gender nonconforming people in a unique and compelling way. Just as eyewitness video of police brutality in communities of color in the U.S. removed plausible deniability and launched a worldwide movement demanding transparency and change, it is our hope that our findings raise greater awareness and spark discussion of the cultural and political climate that is fostering discrimination and encouraging violence against transgender and gender nonconforming people. Most importantly, we hope it helps create a sense of urgency in making laws and policies to protect them.\n\nTRIGGER WARNING\n\nThe report contains text and images that are racist, transphobic, homophobic, and portray acts of physical violence involving transgender and gender non-conforming people\n\nDownload Full Report:\n\nOnline Executive Summary: https://lab.witness.org/projects/transgender-violence/executive-summary/\n\nTo find out more about how you can participate in Trans Awareness Month:",
  "latent_18254": "For months, rumours and conspiracy theories have swirled around the dark corners of the internet about the safety and whereabouts of Julian Assange, the founder and editor-in-chief of whistleblowing website WikiLeaks who currently lives in London under political asylum. Or does he?\n\nSince late-October, when Assange's internet connection was cut off by Ecuador – his host nation – for a slew of leaks that were perceived as influencing the US presidential election, the speculation has intensified. It has now reached the point where every WikiLeaks social media post is met with a barrage of demands for 'proof-of-life'.\n\nAccording to the unfounded theories – of which there are many – Assange is missing, perhaps renditioned by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) or another three-letter agency. Some claim he is in Russia. Others say he remains in the Ecuadorian embassy but is \"compromised\" in some way.\n\nHashtags #proofoflife and #whereisassange are littered by demands for video evidence that Assange is alive and well. Some conspiracy-minded followers have produced images appearing to show mysterious 'white vans' on routes around London. Others claim a recent blackout in the city was related to WikiLeaks.\n\nIs there any truth to the claims?\n\nWell, while the speculation has reached fever pitch, WikiLeaks has continued to publish documents, Assange has given lengthy telephone interviews and close confidantes have visited him in person.\n\nOn 24 November, WikiLeaks' verified Twitter account begged its four million-strong follower base to stop spreading the false rumours. \"Please stop asking us for 'proof of life'. We do not control Assange's physical environment or internet connection,\" it said.\n\nMost recently, during a telephone interview at the Free Connected Minds conference on 26 November, Assange directly addressed the rumours of his untimely demise and timestamped his appearance by referencing the recent death of former Cuban president Fidel Castro.\n\n\"I doubt anything I say here is going to put an end to the rumours,\" he said. \"It's very natural that these have come about because of my high visibility in the last few months in the US [...] It's not an acceptable precedent to have to make an appearance when there are all sorts of security [risks].\"\n\nHowever, on Reddit – which has a section dedicated to sharing these conspiracy theories called r/WhereIsAssange – the commenters were left unfazed by this direct evidence that the WikiLeaks founder was unharmed and still residing in London.\n\n\"Did you think that was him and maybe captured and being tortured? Or it was a voice-over?\" one commenter wrote. \"I felt like he stuttered at the PGP question like he didn't know how to answer. I'm really sad. I feel like he might be dead.\"\n\nAnother said: \"At this point, anyone thinking about leaking to them should be worried if it's a honeypot waiting to catch them. If Assange isn't in trouble, he needs to clarify [via] PGP and make an effort to show he is okay.\"\n\nAround the same, Alex Jones, famed conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars, posted a video online that claimed: \"We were talking to a lot of folks who are really smart and they said 'his group got infiltrated, they have taken it over' [...] this is beyond some spy thriller, folks, this is really happening.\"\n\nHowever, Craig Murray, broadcaster and human rights activist who has visited Assange at the embassy published a blog post on 28 November in an attempt to clear up any confusion.\n\nHe wrote: \"I have been quite amused to receive some – well actually rather a lot of – rather aggressive tweets and other social media messages from people who believe Julian Assange is dead, and are therefore outraged I had supper with him on Friday.\n\n\"This seems to me the ultimate in concern trolling – to pretend to adore someone so much that you are angry and upset to find the object of your adoration has not been killed or kidnapped. It is a peculiar kind of cargo-cult.\n\n\"Best of all are the demands for photos with a sock on the head or a newspaper. To pander to these silly demands would be a never-ending task, and merely spark a new round of craziness – 'that sock on his head is photo-shopped', 'that was a double at the window'.\n\n\"I have been visiting Julian since before Jane from Idaho heard of him, and the purpose of visiting him is not to provide comfort to Jane from Idaho. If my word does that, fine. If she does not want to take my word, also fine.\"\n\nDespite having published sensitive documents for over a decade, WikiLeaks grew in notoriety during the 2016 US election after leaking thousands of emails from the Democratic Party and John Podesta, a close aide to Hillary Clinton. Most recently, it released The Yemen Files and more than half a million US diplomatic cables from 1979.\n\nOn its latest post on Twitter, a link to diplomatic cables allegedly on the Iranian revolution from the 90s, the majority of comments are still asking for proof-of-life. Comments include \"Show us Julian\", \"Where is Assange?\" and \"Why would you show us something 30 years old? You wouldn't. WikiLeaks is compromised.\"",
  "latent_18258": "by the Center for Biological Diversity\n\nCHARLESTON, W.V.— The Center for Biological Diversity filed a lawsuit against the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service today for the agency’s failure to make a listing decision on a petition to protect the Big Sandy crayfish under the Endangered Species Act. The crayfish has been lost from up to 70 percent of its range because of water pollution from mountaintop-removal coal mining. It is nearly gone from West Virginia and has lost close to half of its range in Kentucky and Virginia.\n\n“The Big Sandy crayfish is only found in Appalachia, where mountaintop removal and other sources of pollution are driving it extinct,” said Tierra Curry, a Center biologist and a native of southeastern Kentucky, where the crayfish is found. “Mountaintop-removal coal mining is ruining the water — both for wildlife and for people. If we protect streams for crayfish, we’ll also be protecting people.”\n\nThe Center and regional allies petitioned to protect the crayfish in 2010. In 2011 the Service determined that the crayfish “may warrant” protection as an endangered species, but it has failed to take the next required step, a 12-month finding on whether protection is warranted. The crayfish is threatened primarily by pollution from surface coal mining but also by proposed interstate construction in West Virginia and pollution from logging and leaking septic tanks.\n\nThe Big Sandy crayfish is known from Buchanan, Dickenson, Giles and Wise counties in Virginia, and from Logan, Mercer and Wyoming counties in West Virginia. In Kentucky it is known from Clark, Estill, Floyd and Pike counties, but could occur in more counties in the eastern part of the state.\n\nPollution from mountaintop-removal coal mining has been associated with increased risk of cancer and birth defects in humans. More than 2,000 miles of streams in Appalachia have been degraded by this mechanized form of mining, which employs far fewer people than other forms.\n\nCrayfish are also known as crawdads, crawfish, mudbugs and freshwater lobsters. They’re considered to be a keystone animal because the holes they dig create habitat used by more than 400 other species, including bass, catfish, frogs and small mammals. Crayfish keep streams cleaner by eating decaying plants and animals, and they are eaten in turn by fish, giant salamanders and raccoons, making them an important link in the food chain. Their burrowing activity helps maintain healthy soil by transferring nutrients between soil layers.\n\nThe Southeast is home to more kinds of freshwater animals than anywhere else in the world, but the region has recently lost more than 50 freshwater animals to extinction. The Center is working to save more than 400 vanishing southeastern aquatic species.\n\nAdvertisements",

Humanity finds itself increasingly at a loss for freshwater while roughly 315 million trillion gallons of unusable seawater taunts us from our shores.\n\nSure, desalination plants are becoming more common. They are very expensive, however, and so energy intensive that they only further contribute to the climate change they are attempting remedy (thereby, joining corn-based ethanol as the two largest non-solutions to our climate problems).\n\nFear not my fellow water-loving earthlings! There is an even better way to remove the salt from salt water: a Seawater Greenhouse! This UK-based company explains the process as one that:\n\nuses seawater to cool and humidify the air that ventilates the greenhouse and sunlight to distill fresh water from seawater. This enables the year round cultivation of high value crops that would otherwise be difficult or impossible to grow in hot, arid (conditions).\n\nThe overall process produces water at the energy cost of less than 3kWh/m3.

Copy the lint results to report folder.\n\nThe final script - Check here.\n\n:tada: That’s it for lint. Try running your job and you will see lint trend graph next to your job results. You can configure the lint graph presentation from jenkins plugin configuration. Add androidLint/configure/ to url of your job on Jenkins for trend graph configuration.\n\nRun twice\n\nIf you can’t see the trend graph -> build again. Sometimes the trend graph is not shown if you have only one build with results - no actual trend here ;) So, run and build again.\n\nTests\n\nTests in Android are separated into 2 types:\n\nLocal unit tests Located at module-name/src/test/java/ - These are tests that run on your machine’s local Java Virtual Machine (JVM). Use these tests to minimize execution time when your tests have no Android framework dependencies or when you can mock the Android framework dependencies.\n\nInstrumented tests Located at module-name/src/androidTest/java/ - These are tests that run on a hardware device or emulator. These tests have access to Instrumentation APIs, give you access to information such as the Context of the app you are testing, and let you control the app under test from your test code. Use these tests when writing integration and functional UI tests to automate user interaction, or when your tests have Android dependencies that mock objects cannot satisfy.\n\nYour project’s (1) instrumented tests and (2) local JVM tests are visible in either the Project view (left) or Android view (right).\n\nIn this post we are going to run Local unit tests and present the results in Jenkins job. The instrumentation tests building and execution will be explained in separate blog post.\n\nConfigure Jenkins Job\n\nWe continue upding the sample build.sh script.\n\nInstall Necessary Plugins\n\nInstall these plugins: Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> Available\n\nJUnit Plugin https://wiki.jenkins.io/display/JENKINS/JUnit+Plugin. The JUnit plugin provides a publisher that consumes XML test reports generated during the builds and provides some graphical visualization of the historical test results as well as a web UI for viewing test reports, tracking failures, and so on.\n\nConfigure Job\n\nTo present tests results we will configure the job.\n\nSelect job -> Configure Scroll to Post-build Actions Add post-build action ▼ -> Publish JUnit test result report Fill and set the location of folder with report XMLs. We’ll make sure that after running tests all reports files will be located under report/test-results folder: Test report XMLs report/test-results/*.xml Health report amplification factor 1.0\n\nThe jenkins job configuration looks like this - Click here for full screen\n\nExecution script - build.sh\n\nWe continue updating build.sh script. The updated script will do next steps:\n\nUpdate key store values in gradle.properties file. Build debug or release APK. Run lint Run junit tests Move ready apk to artifacts folder. Move lint results to report folder. Move tests results from all modules to report/test-results folder.\n\nBefore I dive into the script details you can check this ready example. You can use this example as is, just make sure to rename the scripts-part-3 folder to scripts .\n\nRun unit tests\n\nif [ $buildType = 'debug' ]; then ./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --stacktrace elif [ $buildType = 'release' ]; then ./gradlew testReleaseUnitTest --stacktrace fi\n\nBased on build type run the test gradle task. The tests results for each module will be located under: {module}/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest . (for debug build type).\n\nMove results to report folder\n\nmkdir report/test-results modules=(\"app\" \"common\") for module in \"${modules[@]}\" do testsDir=\"\" if [ $buildType = 'debug' ]; then testsDir=\"$module/build/test-results/testDebugUnitTest\" elif [ $buildType = 'release' ]; then testsDir=\"$module/build/test-results/testReleaseUnitTest\" fi if [ ! \"$(ls -A $testsDir)\" ]; then echo \"Unit tests report wasn't found for module: $module\" continue fi # copy all files inside, to our folder cp $testsDir/* report/test-results/ done\n\nCreate sub test-results folder inside report folder. Since each of the modules can contain junit tests we need collect all of them and place in one folder so Jenkins can find and present them. In this script we iterate over all modules in array modules=(\"app\" \"common\") and copy the junit tests results into report/test-results/ .\n\nThe final script - Check here.\n\n:tada: That’s it for junit tests. Try running your job and you will see test result trend graph next to your job results.\n\nInstrumented tests - The execution part\n\nIn one of the next blog posts I will explain how to build and execute instrumented tests part of Jenkins jobs. For now, these are 2 blog posts you can read of what can be achieved by running such tests.\n\nRunning Android UI Tests - Part 1\n\nSharding and running Android UI tests in parallel. How we improved execution tests time by 40%. Running Android UI Tests - Part 2\n\nFor each test — collect logs, record a video, dump db, preferences and more. Clear data, run by tags and with params.

  "latent_18965": "North Korea’s latest nuclear test, once again, seems to have surprised everyone.\n\nComing only nine months after its last nuclear detonation and following ever-advancing ballistic missile tests, including a successful submarine launch just two weeks ago, Kim Jong Un’s latest wake-up call to world leaders will be hard to ignore.\n\nBut why now? And, for a leadership recently experiencing a flurry of high-profile defections, what does the latest test mean for stability in Pyongyang?\n\nAnd where does this test leave the United States and South Korea, two countries facing Presidential elections in November this year and December 2017 respectively? Finally, will the latest test prompt China to turn up the heat in terms of sanctions implementation? Or does the test show that Beijing has more or less given up?\n\nTo find out, NK News spoke to a range of experts in both South Korea and the U.S, including:\n\nBruce Bennett – Senior Defense Analyst, RAND\n\n– Senior Defense Analyst, RAND Bruce Klingner – Senior Research Fellow, Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation\n\n– Senior Research Fellow, Northeast Asia at The Heritage Foundation Duyeon Kim – Visiting Senior Fellow, KPFF\n\n– Visiting Senior Fellow, KPFF Eom Sang-yoon – Senior Researcher, Sejong Institute\n\n– Senior Researcher, Sejong Institute John Delury – Associate Professor of Chinese Studies, Yonsei University\n\n– Associate Professor of Chinese Studies, Yonsei University Melissa Hanham – (META) Lab, Monterey Institute\n\n– (META) Lab, Monterey Institute Yang Moo-Jin – Seoul’s University of North Korean Studies\n\n1. Why test now?\n\nNorth Korea appears to have just performed its 5th nuclear weapon test. This date was apparently chosen to correspond with North Korea Foundation Day, a major national holiday.\n\nBut the North has also been hyping its missile and nuclear threats this year, starting with its 4th nuclear weapon test and a satellite launch/ICBM test in January and February. Since then, it has launched over 30 theater ballistic missiles of 200 km range or greater—more than the number of North theater ballistic missiles tests in previous history.\n\nNorth Korea suffered international sanctions for its nuclear weapon and ICBM tests (UN Security Council Resolution 2270), sanctions which may hurt the North Korean economy. These missile tests and now the 5th nuclear test have all been major signs of North Korean defiance against that UN Security Council Resolution.\n\nKorea watchers endlessly debate the timing and motivation of North Korean actions, perceiving a linkage to anniversaries, potential regime instability, or a supposed response to U.S./ROK actions. Such debate is the lifeblood of analysts but is unresolvable, sometimes used to excuse North Korea’s abhorrent behavior, and ultimately worthless.\n\nInstead, the focus should be on the North Korean actions – which are provocation, violations of UN resolutions or laws, or deadly attacks – rather than the array of possible regime motivations. Perhaps the latest nuclear test was timed to celebrate North Korean Founding Day but more important than the timing is that the test is another blatant defiance of UN resolutions and the international community must respond.\n\nThis apparent nuclear test is a serious concern but certainly not surprising because we have been and should continue to expect North Korea to continue testing its nuclear devices and missiles. Pyongyang has every technological, political, strategic, and national reason to continue testing. Continued testing helps perfect its technology.\n\nToday’s timing is also politically advantageous for the North because it coincides with the anniversary of the regime and a series of international summits in the region. I’d be curious to learn if this was one or two simultaneous tests. India tested two nuclear devices together before calling it quits, and I have wondered if or when North Korea would think about following suit.\n\nIt’s a national holiday (though it’s almost always a national holiday in North Korea).\n\nTechnically speaking, a newer pattern we’re seeing with both the missile and the nuclear side is an accelerated pace of testing.\n\nSo it would appear to be that there’s a real drive on the technical side to demonstrate to themselves and to the world that this is a full-on proper nuclear arsenal.\n\nSince the North chose September 9 (its national foundation day), the test can be understood as an attempt to strengthen the solidarity of the regime.\n\nHowever, the North did it for external purposes at a time when the South Korea – U.S. joint military drills and G20 summit in Hangzhou of China finished.\n\nThe North showed its strategic determination to the outside world that it will make sure of its position as nuclear weapons state.\n\nThey declared this year to be the one to demonstrate their capability, which for years, we have not been taking seriously. In the days leading up to today, they’ve been very frustrated in their state media. After the last round of sessions at the UN Security Council, there was an envoy sent to China where things may have gone badly and so I think it’s probably one part political and one part scientific.\n\nThey had a test in January that they declared a thermonuclear test, but most analysts felt the seismic yield was too low for it to really be thought of as a thermonuclear test. They may be following up again and I don’t know precisely what the yields of this device may be yet, but we have to wait until all the different seismic stations that are collecting data can agree on a seismic number and then we can make estimates, but it’s very hard to make an estimate.\n\nThis test is no surprise to me as the North has been reiterating to conduct its next test if their “peace offensive” does not work as intended.\n\n2. What does this signify about regime stability?\n\nThe nuclear test is not reflective of regime stability or instability but rather the manifestation of Pyongyang’s decade-long quest to develop, augment, and refine its nuclear arsenal and the means to deliver them via missiles against the U.S. and its allies.\n\nThis year North Korea has engaged in a rapid-fire series of nuclear and missile tests. In addition to the two nuclear tests, Kim Jong Un has successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile, a road-mobile intermediate-range missile, a submarine-launched ballistic missile, upgraded medium- and short-range missiles, re-entry vehicle technology, a new solid-fuel rocket engine, and an improved liquid-fuel ICBM engine.\n\nDuring Kim Jong Un’s four-year reign, Pyongyang has conducted 37 missile tests, more than twice as many as his father Kim Jong Il in 17 years in office.\n\nWith this apparent nuclear test, Pyongyang seems to be saying that international sanctions and condemnation will not stop it from achieving its nuclear-missile goals.\n\nThe North is likely telling its domestic and international audiences that the apparent test is more “evidence” of its claimed status as a stable, nuclear power.\n\nKim needs the tests to manage his internal instability, about which we have heard much in recent weeks especially relative to high-level defectors. In many ways, North Korea a very weak state. Kim uses a combination of brutality and diversion (e.g., missile and nuclear tests) to try to control both the masses and his elites. His missile launches and nuclear tests are attempts to divert attention from his other failures (economy, international politics, …), and also in an attempt to secure North Korean military support and to deter outside action against him.\n\nEach provocation suggests that he is feeling more and more internal pressure which he must divert. Might he be preparing to carry out limited attacks against South Korea, as his father and he did in 2010?\n\nThrough the fifth nuclear test, Kim Jong Un attempts to internally highlight his leadership image.\n\nHe is showing that he can confront the U.S., and is showing his strategic will to cling to his way without submitting to the pressure and sanctions from internationally society.\n\nThis North Korean test is a cynical message to the Seoul government, which has been claiming that the North is undergoing an internal breakdown recently.\n\nWe do not have the confirmed data on its magnitude yet, but if the result is significantly better – for example, twice as stronger than before – then its message will carry far more weight.\n\nThe test can consolidate internal unity in a way. However, the impact on regime stability would have been greatest after their first test. This is the fifth test (so it will have small ripple effect), but Kim Jong Un doesn’t have any other option to consolidate his power.\n\nIn reality, the best way (to stabilize the regime) is by developing the economy and making people live well. However, Kim Jong Un has limited options, and can’t help but improve nuclear and missile capabilities. He boasts his leadership through military armaments.\n\nIt has nothing to do with regime stability and we need to stop asking that question. This place has been around for 70 years, it’s just a state just like the rest of us.\n\nI don’t know if I would draw any particular conclusion about the regime stability. I wouldn’t go so far as to connect the dots there.\n\n3. What does this mean for South Korea and the U.S.?\n\nFrom a political context, the North Koreans do focus on the United States in terms of nuclear issues, and that is their primary interlocutor. They are certainly aware that there is an election coming up and they are aware that they have a lame duck president who is not going to do anything with them, so I think there’s a double-edged sword with the United States.\n\nOn the one hand, getting a fifth test over before the new President takes office (which appears to be an aim), while they are also putting a kind of exclamation point on the end of the eight years of the Obama policy of strategic patience policy, of mostly sanctions. This is the North Korean way of saying “See look, here’s what you’ve reaped.”\n\nIn a weird way, you could leave a little bit of room for a Trump or a Clinton to start off not with a nuclear test on day one, or rather that this fifth test is instead a memory of the many tests that they’ve done. They are very aware of American politics.\n\nFor South Korea, President Park completely reversed her policy towards North Korea. She abandoned the politics of talking to them even when there’s been no progress on the nuclear issue. What we’ve seen this year after the fourth test is South Korea reverting to a traditional, conservative approach and just really not talking to the North Koreans. And, this time Seuol is going global in an effort to apply more pressure and talk about unification on the premise that it will collapse. So what does the fifth test do? I think it just accelerates the line in Seoul even harder, but it already changed up after the fourth test, so I don’t think this was any type of game changer.\n\nThe United States has been pursuing a policy of “strategic patience” relative to the North Korean nuclear weapon threat, hoping that North Korea would eventually agree to give up its nuclear weapons. But Kim has amended the North Korean constitution to say that North Korea is a nuclear state, and the North regularly proclaims that it will never give up its nuclear weapons.\n\nThe United States now needs to take a more serious approach both to deterring North Korean use of nuclear weapons and to stopping the developments of the North Korean nuclear weapons program. Economic sanctions and hope will not solve the problem.\n\nThis is how Kim Jong Un “communicates” with the world. During the recent G20 held in China, the surrounding nations displayed concerns that they are against its nuclear development.\n\nThrough this test, Pyongyang has just sent the message that it will walk its paths, and neither China nor Russia can affect its decision-making process.\n\nThe apparent test is another reminder that we need to find an effective diplomatic solution to both the nuclear-missile problem and Pyongyang’s security concerns.\n\nThe Obama administration, with just months left, will only be able to manage the situation. So this falls on the next US president who should make the North Korea issue a top preoccupation.\n\nIt is a life-or-death situation for South Korea and a threat to the US and Japan.\n\nI think there’s already a good level of cooperation between South Korea and the U.S., and I think that it’s going to cause them to want to cooperate further. Most of the discussion lately has been around THAAD and missile defenses, the rocket test they did just recently, the Scud-ER had their range for the first time, and open source in new ways. And so there’s probably a lot of U.S.-SK cooperation going on about what to do about that type of delivery device.\n\nI can’t say what they have tested but if they are testing the silver orb we saw earlier, then that is very troubling. But of course we have no idea whether that’s what they’re really testing something or if they’re testing something much larger…in terms of physical size.\n\nWashington, Seoul, and Tokyo will press for closing several loopholes to UNSCR 2270, most notably eliminating the “livelihood purposes” exemption on the ban of North Korean export of its resources. The Obama Administration has pulled its punches on implementing U.S. sanctions on North Korea until pressured by recent Congressional legislation (the North Korea Sanctions and Policy Enforcement Act) which stipulated mandatory enforcement of U.S. law. The administration has still not imposed a single secondary sanction on Chinese entities facilitating prohibited North Korean actions.\n\nSanctions and targeted financial measures may take time to have an impact on the regime’s financial condition. But in the short-term, such measures enforce U.S. and international law, impose a penalty on violators, and constrain the inflow and export of prohibited items for the nuclear and missile programs. The difficulty will be maintaining international resolve to stay the course. Already, some have expressed impatience with the months-old sanctions and advocated a return to the decades-long attempts at diplomacy which failed to achieve denuclearization.\n\nThis means the North will continue on its way.\n\nThe South and the U.S. strengthened the sanctions and said many defectors have fled the North due to its bad economic situation; and the North’s regime has been shaken.\n\nIn response, the North said there was no problem with its system, and would get its own way.\n\nThe North sent a message that the policies of the South and the U.S. toward the North failed, and is urging them to change their policies.\n\n4. Will this be enough to get China on on-board?\n\nThis explains why the North Korean diplomat Choe Son Hui recently visited China. I am convinced that she was there to announce their next test, and Beijing would have most likely stood against it as such act would only corner China.\n\nPyongyang’s message to Beijing is simple: “In the field of the nuclear development, I will walk my way. Don’t try to make your influence felt on us.”\n\nChina has recently been placing major pressure on South Korea to prevent the U.S. deployment of the THAAD missile defense system in Korea—a system designed for protection against the growing North Korean nuclear and missile threat. As part of that pressure, China has apparently not been rigorously imposing the sanctions from UN Security Council Resolution 2270 (reportedly, trade between China and North Korea actually grew 9% in 2016 versus 2015).\n\nIt is hard to tell whether China will decide to assume the role of a regional Great Power and seek to curtail the North’s provocative behavior—thus far, China has really not decided to do so. It is ironic that China opposes the U.S. THAAD missile defense system being deployed in South Korea, when China deploys a similar missile defense system referred as the HQ-19, which China appears to deploy against the North Korean NoDong and Musudan missiles—the same threats that worry South Korea.\n\nNo, absolutely not.\n\nIf the sea change that people are looking for from Beijing would have come with the fourth test. And there are those that said it’s coming, and now they have to admit that it didn’t come. So what’s going to happen with this fifth test? There’s going to be an immediate period after the test where China will participate – sort of try and stay in the mainstream along with others for whatever’s going to happen at the UN level. And there will be this and that, in terms of tightening of sanctions here and there.\n\nBut the Chinese are so clear that they don’t think sanctions will solve this problem. They can’t say it enough. And so they may be shy in saying it immediately after the test, because everyone’s outraged, but that’s their policy, that’s their language, and that will continue to be the case after this one.\n\nUN Security Council members will convene an emergency meeting to respond to Pyongyang’s latest violation of UN resolutions. The council tends to reserve its harshest responses for nuclear tests. China remains the wild card in UN deliberations, however, typically demanding weaker responses and only lackadaisically enforcing required sanctions.\n\nBeijing recently prevented any UN response to a North Korean missile test in retaliation for U.S. plans to deploy the THAAD ballistic missile defense to South Korea. But China subsequently agreed to a strongly-worded UN press statement to Pyongyang’s most recent missile test, negating the argument that Beijing would block all UN action over the THAAD deployment.\n\nWell, I wouldn’t say they’re off-board. I think they went farther than they’ve ever gone for the last round of sanctions.\n\nI think China has a very hard time enforcing those sanctions because it has a huge trade volume all over the world. We have watched the DPRK-Chinese traffic and we have seen that the traffic hasn’t necessarily flowed.\n\nFor me, watching the traffic across the China-North Korea border will be the best to answer this question.\n\nThe latest apparent nuclear test places a burden on China, but Beijing is unlikely to crack down on Pyongyang the way the international community desires because of its own strategic interests and because it believes in positive inducements like dialogue and a peace treaty to change North Korean behavior.\n\nBeijing might consider rethinking its current position if Washington’s response creates a negative security environment for China.\n\nChina will join the movement of sanctions because the nuclear test is in violation of China’s three broad principles on the Korean peninsula and China is a leader in international society.\n\nHowever, China will considerably fall into a dilemma because the movement can accelerate the deployment of the Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) on the Korean peninsula based on the trilateral alliance among the South, the U.S. and Japan.\n\nChina’s opposition to THAAD deployment doesn’t necessarily mean that it accepts the North’s missile and nuclear weapons.\n\nChina stands against THAAD deployment since it could damage its interests. But the issue of whether iit will actively engage in enforcing UN sanctions also hinge upon their interests. I believe China will express its opposition, and join the UN Security Council in more sanctions.\n\nMain picture: NK News\n\nAdditional reporting: J.H. Ahn, Dagyum Ji, Christina Lee",

  "latent_19445": "A new bombshell study released by the Government Accountability Institute shows why President Donald Trump’s Advisory Commission on Election Integrity has such an important job ahead of it.\n\nThe institute concluded in its report that thousands of votes in the 2016 election were illegal duplicate votes from people who registered and voted in more than one state.\n\nThe Government Accountability Institute, founded by Peter Schweizer, author of “Clinton Cash,” seeks to “investigate and expose crony capitalism, misuse of taxpayer monies, and other governmental corruption or malfeasance.”\n\nOver the last few months, the institute sought to obtain “public voter information” from every state in order to search for duplicate votes. This is the same type of information the president’s election integrity commission has requested.\n\nWith this report, we may have a clue as to why some states are resisting providing this data.\n\nThe Government Accountability Institute was able to obtain voter registration and voter history data from only 21 states because while some states shared it freely, “others impose exorbitant costs or refuse to comply with voter information requests.”\n\nThese 21 states represent “about 17 percent of all possible state-to-state comparison combinations.”\n\nThe institute compared the lists using an “extremely conservative matching approach that sought only to identify two votes cast in the same legal name.” It found that 8,471 votes in 2016 were “highly likely” duplicates.\n\nExtrapolating this to all 50 states would likely produce, with “high-confidence,” around 45,000 duplicate votes.\n\nThe institute obtained this level of confidence by matching not only names and birthdays—which can be the same for different individuals—but also by contracting with companies, such as Virtual DBS, that have commercial databases to further cross-check these individuals using their Social Security numbers and other information.\n\nAccording to the Government Accountability Institute’s experts, “the probability of correctly matching two records with the same name, birthdate, and Social Security number is close to 100 percent.” In fact, “using these match points will result in virtually zero false positives.”\n\nThe probability of 45,000 illegal duplicate votes is the low end of the spectrum, and it does not even account for other types of fraud such as ineligible voting by noncitizens and felons and absentee ballot fraud.\n\nTo put this number of fraudulent votes in perspective, Hillary Clinton won New Hampshire by fewer than 3,000 votes out of over 700,000 cast. Just this number of duplicate votes alone has the power to swing state results and, in turn, elections.\n\nUnfortunately, New Hampshire refused to turn over its data for this study.\n\nThere have been other razor-tight elections in recent years. In 2000, the presidency was decided by 537 votes out of a total of 105 million cast. In 2008, Al Franken won his Minnesota Senate race by a mere 312 votes. He ended up being the deciding vote that gave this country Obamacare.\n\nThough the institute did not look at the 2008 elections in this study, there is little doubt that the 2016 numbers show that duplicate voting and voter fraud are a real problem that can have serious consequential effects.\n\nThe Government Accountability Institute also used the state of Rhode Island as a test case. Over 30 percent of all registered voters in Rhode Island have no Social Security or driver’s license number on file.\n\nWhile it is legal to register without providing this information, the institute notes that “confirming the identities of some of these voters is impossible using only the data contained in the state’s voter registration system.”\n\nWithout this “uniquely identifying information … there is no way to confirm a voter’s identity or citizenship … ” This shows the vulnerabilities that are ripe for any person or group wanting to take advantage of them.\n\nThe institute also found more than 15,000 voters registered at prohibited addresses “such as post office boxes, UPS stores, federal post offices, and public buildings.” In some cases, more than 100 voters “were registered to the same UPS store locations.”\n\nThey also found voters whose registered addresses were “gas stations, vacant lots, abandoned mill buildings, basketball courts, parks, warehouses, and office buildings.”\n\nThe institute tried to bring some of these problems to the attention of Rhode Island election officials as part of its test case. It provided officials with a list of 225 voters who “were registered using prohibited addresses.”\n\nBut Rhode Island refused to do anything about the problem beyond sending a letter to the voters. If a voter did not respond, the state refused to take any further action.\n\nInstead, in an obvious attempt to deter the Government Accountability Institute, the state said that the institute would have to file a “voter challenge” and would be subject to a misdemeanor penalty if it filed a “false challenge.”\n\nThe fact that these election officials did not want to thoroughly investigate possible voter fraud illustrates one of the problems in this area: Too many election officials don’t want to know about these problems, and refuse to do anything when it is brought to their attention.\n\nThe Government Accountability Institute points out that the quality of the voter registration data in some states is very poor, with missing and obviously incorrect information. The institute found 45,880 votes cast by individuals whose dates of birth were more than 115 years before the election.\n\nSeveral hundred votes were cast by individuals whose registration birthdates “indicated they were under 18 years old at the time of the election,” although some of these were through provisional ballots.\n\nAll of this is just the latest evidence that we have serious, substantive problems in our voter registration system across the country and that voter fraud is, without a doubt, real.\n\nThe Heritage Foundation has a database that is being constantly updated. It documents nearly 1,100 proven instances of voter fraud, including cases where elections were overturned because of proven fraud.\n\nThis kind of work, which the Government Accountability Institute has done, will be invaluable to the Election Integrity Commission as it researches the registration and voting process and looks for ways to fix its vulnerabilities and security problems, enhance our democratic process, and make sure every eligible American votes and is not disenfranchised by illegal votes.\n\nElection integrity and public confidence in the election process are fundamental to preserving our democratic republic.\n\nDisclosure: Hans von Spakovsky is a member of the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity mentioned in this article.",

  "latent_19681": "History Edit\n\nPerformance standards Edit\n\nRifle resistant armor Edit\n\nBecause of the limitations of the technology a distinction is made between handgun protection and rifle protection. See NIJ levels 3 and 4 for typical requirements for rifle resistant armor. Broadly rifle resistant armor is of three basic types: ceramic plate-based systems, steel plate with spall fragmentation protective coating, and hard fiber-based laminate systems. Many rifle armor components contain both hard ceramic components and laminated textile materials used together. Various ceramic materials types are in use, however: aluminum oxide, boron carbide and silicon carbide are the most common.[52] The fibers used in these systems are the same as found in soft textile armor. However, for rifle protection high pressure lamination of ultra high molecular weight polyethylene with a Kraton matrix is the most common. The Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI) and the enhanced SAPI plate for the US DOD generally has this form.[53] Because of the use of ceramic plates for rifle protection, these vests are 5–8 times as heavy on an area basis as handgun protection. The weight and stiffness of rifle armor is a major technical challenge. The density, hardness and impact toughness are among the materials properties that are balanced to design these systems. While ceramic materials have some outstanding properties for ballistics they have poor fracture toughness. Failure of ceramic plates by cracking must also be controlled.[54] For this reason many ceramic rifle plates are a composite. The strike face is ceramic with the backface formed of laminated fiber and resin materials. The hardness of the ceramic prevents the penetration of the bullet while the tensile strength of the fiber backing helps prevent tensile failure. Examples of rifle resistant outer vests include the Interceptor body armor and the Improved Outer Tactical Vest. Versus armor-piercing ammunition Edit The standards for armor-piercing rifle bullets aren't clear-cut, because the penetration of a bullet depends on the hardness of the target armor. However, there are a few general rules. For example, bullets with a soft lead-core and copper jacket are too easily deformed to penetrate hard materials, whereas rifle bullets manufactured with very hard core materials, like tungsten carbide, are designed for maximum penetration into hard armor.[55] Most other core materials would have effects between lead and tungsten carbide. Many common bullets, such as the 7.62×39mm M43 standard cartridge for the AK-47 rifle,[56] have a steel core with hardness rating ranging from Rc35 mild steel up to Rc45 medium hard steel. Additionally, as the hardness of the bullet core increases, so must the amount of ceramic plating used to stop penetration. Like in soft ballistics, a minimum ceramic material hardness of the bullet core is required to damage their respective hard core materials, however in armor-piercing rounds the bullet core is eroded rather than deformed.[57] The US Department of Defense uses two classes of protection from armor-piercing rifle bullets. The first, the Small Arms Protective Insert (SAPI), called for ceramic composite plates with a mass of 20–30 kg/m2 (4–5 lb/ft2). Later, the Enhanced SAPI (ESAPI) specification was developed to protect from more penetrative ammunition. ESAPI ceramic plates have a density of 35–45 kg/m2 (7–9 lb/ft2), and are designed to stop bullets like the .30-06 AP (M2) with an engineered hard core. Cercom, now BAE systems, CoorsTek, Ceradyne, TenCate Advanced Composites, Honeywell, DSM, Pinnacle Armor and a number of other engineering companies develop and manufacture the materials for composite ceramic rifle armor.[58]\n\nExplosive protection Edit\n\nBomb suit being used in a training exercise Bomb disposal officers often wear heavy armor[59][60][61] designed to protect against most effects of a moderate sized explosion, such as bombs encountered in terror threats. Full head helmet, covering the face and some degree of protection for limbs is mandatory in addition to very strong armor for the torso. An insert to protect the spine is usually applied to the back, in case an explosion blasts the wearer. Visibility and mobility of the wearer is severely limited, as is the time that can be spent working on the device. Armor designed primarily to counter explosives is often somewhat less effective against bullets than armor designed for that purpose. The sheer mass of most bomb disposal armor usually provides some protection, and bullet-specific trauma plates are compatible with some bomb disposal suits. Bomb disposal technicians try to accomplish their task if possible using remote methods (e.g., robots, line and pulleys). Actually laying hands on a bomb is only done in an extremely life-threatening situation, where the hazards to people and critical structures cannot be lessened by using wheeled robots or other techniques.\n\nStab and stab-ballistic armor Edit\n\nSee also: Stab vest Early \"ice pick\" test Edit In the mid-1980s the state of California Department of Corrections issued a requirement for a body armor using a commercial ice pick as the test penetrator. The test method attempted to simulate the capacity of a human attacker to deliver impact energy with their upper body. As was later shown by the work of the former British PSDB, this test over stated the capacity of human attackers. The test used a drop mass or sabot that carried the ice pick. Using gravitational force, the height of the drop mass above the vest was proportional to the impact energy. This test specified 109 joules (81 ft·lb) of energy and a 7.3 kg (16 lb) drop mass with a drop height of 153 cm (60 in). The ice pick has a 4 mm (0.16 in) diameter with a sharp tip with a 5.4 m/s (17 ft/s) terminal velocity in the test. The California standard did not include knife or cutting edge weapons in the test protocol. The test method used the oil/clay (Roma Plastilena) tissue simulant as a test backing. In this early phase only titanium and steel plate offerings were successful in addressing this requirement. Point Blank developed the first ice pick certified offerings for CA Department of Corrections in shaped titanium sheet metal. Vests of this type are still in service in US corrections facilities as of 2008. Beginning in the early 1990s, an optional test method was approved by California which permitted the use of 10% ballistic gelatin as a replacement for Roma clay. The transition from hard, dense clay-based Roma to soft low-density gelatin allowed all textile solutions to meet this attack energy requirement. Soft all textile “ice pick” vests began to be adopted by California and other US states as a result of this migration in the test methods. It is important for users to understand that the smooth, round tip of the ice pick does not cut fiber on impact and this permits the use of textile based vests for this application. The earliest of these “all” fabric vests designed to address this ice pick test was Warwick Mills's TurtleSkin ultra tightly woven para-aramid fabric with a patent filed in 1993.[62] Shortly after the TurtleSkin work, in 1995 DuPont patented a medium density fabric that was designated as Kevlar Correctional.[63] It should be noted that these textile materials do not have equal performance with cutting-edge threats and these certifications were only with ice pick and were not tested with knives. HOSDB-Stab and Slash standards Edit Parallel to the US development of “ice pick” vests, the British police, PSDB, was working on standards for knife-resistant body armor. Their program adopted a rigorous scientific approach and collected data on human attack capacity.[64] Their ergonomic study suggested three levels of threat: 25, 35 and 45 joules of impact energy. In addition to impact energy attack, velocities were measured and were found to be 10–20 m/s (much faster than the California test). Two commercial knives were selected for use in this PSDB test method. In order to test at a representative velocity, an air cannon method was developed to propel the knife and sabot at the vest target using compressed air. In this first version, the PSDB ’93 test also used oil/clay materials as the tissue simulant backing. The introduction of knives which cut fiber and a hard-dense test backing required stab vest manufacturers to use metallic components in their vest designs to address this more rigorous standard. The current standard HOSDB Body Armour Standards for UK Police (2007) Part 3: Knife and Spike Resistance is harmonized with the US NIJ OO15 standard, use a drop test method and use a composite foam backing as a tissue simulant. Both the HOSDB and the NIJ test now specify engineered blades, double-edged S1 and single-edge P1 as well as the spike. In addition to the stab standards, HOSDB has developed a standard for slash resistance (2006). This standard, like the stab standards, is based on drop testing with a test knife in a mounting of controlled mass. The slash test uses the Stanley Utility knife or box cutter blades. The slash standard tests the cut resistance of the armor panel parallel to the direction of blade travel. The test equipment measures the force at the instant the blade tip produces a sustained slash through the vest. The criteria require that slash failure of the armor be greater than 80 newtons of force.[65] Combination stab and ballistic vests Edit Vests that combined stab and ballistic protection were a significant innovation in the 1990s period of vest development. The starting point for this development were the ballistic-only offerings of that time using NIJ Level 2A, 2, and 3A or HOSDB HG 1 and 2, with compliant ballistic vest products being manufactured with areal densities of between 5.5 and 6 kg/m² (1.1 and 1.2 lb/ft² or 18 and 20 oz/ft²). However police forces were evaluating their “street threats” and requiring vests with both knife and ballistic protection. This multi-threat approach is common in the United Kingdom and other European countries and is less popular in the USA. Unfortunately for multi-threat users, the metallic array and chainmail systems that were necessary to defeat the test blades offered little ballistic performance. The multi-threat vests have areal densities are close to the sum of the two solutions separately. These vests have mass values in the 7.5–8.5 kg/m² (1.55–1.75 lb/ft²) range. Ref (NIJ and HOSDB certification listings). Rolls Royce Composites -Megit and Highmark produced metallic array systems to address this HOSDB standard. These designs were used extensively by the London Metropolitan Police Service and other agencies in the United Kingdom. Edit Metropolitan Police officers supervising World Cup, 2006 As vest manufactures and the specifying authorities worked with these standards, the UK and US Standards teams began a collaboration on test methods.[66] A number of issues with the first versions of the tests needed to be addressed. The use of commercial knives with inconsistent sharpness and tip shape created problems with test consistency. As a result, two new “engineered blades” were designed that could be manufactured to have reproducible penetrating behavior. The tissue simulants, Roma clay and gelatin, were either unrepresentative of tissue or not practical for the test operators. A composite-foam and hard-rubber test backing was developed as an alternative to address these issues. The drop test method was selected as the baseline for the updated standard over the air cannon option. The drop mass was reduced from the “ice pick test” and a wrist-like soft linkage was engineered into the penetrator-sabot to create a more realistic test impact. These closely related standards were first issued in 2003 as HOSDB 2003 and NIJ 0015. (The Police Scientific Development Branch (PSDB) was renamed the Home Office Scientific Development Branch in 2004.)[67] Stab and spike vests Edit These new standards created a focus on Level 1 at 25 joules (18 ft⋅lbf), Level 2 at 35 J (26 ft⋅lbf), Level 3 at 45 J (33 ft⋅lbf) protection as tested with the new engineered knives defined in these test documents. The lowest level of this requirement at 25 joules was addressed by a series of textile products of both wovens, coated wovens and laminated woven materials. All of these materials were based on Para-aramid fiber. The co-efficient of friction for ultra high molecular weigh polyethylene (UHMWPE) prevented its use in this application. The TurtleSkin DiamondCoat and Twaron SRM products addressed this requirement using a combination of Para-Aramid wovens and bonded ceramic grain. These ceramic-coated products do not have the flexibility and softness of un-coated textile materials. For the higher levels of protection L2 and L3, the very aggressive penetration of the small, thin P1 blade has resulted in the continued use of metallic components in stab armor. In Germany, Mehler Vario Systems developed hybrid vests of woven para-aramid and chainmail, and their solution was selected by London's Metropolitan Police Service.[citation needed] Another German company BSST, in cooperation with Warwick Mills, has developed a system to meet the ballistic-stab requirement using Dyneema laminate and an advanced metallic-array system, TurtleSkin MFA. This system is currently implemented in the Netherlands.[citation needed] The trend in multi threat armor continues with requirements for needle protection in the Draft ISO prEN ISO 14876 norm. In many countries there is also an interest to combine military style explosive fragmentation protection with bullet-ballistics and stab requirements.\n\nVest sizing, carriers and encapsulation Edit\n\nIn order for ballistic protection to be wearable the ballistic panels and hard rifle-resistant plates are fitted inside a special carrier. The carrier is the visible part of a ballistic vest. The most basic carrier includes pockets which hold the ballistic panels and straps for mounting the carrier on the user. There are two major types of carriers: military or tactical carriers that are worn over the shirt, and covert law enforcement type carriers that are worn under the shirt. Military carriers Edit Individual pieces comprising the Modular Tactical Vest worn by U.S. Marines , including SAPI plates (gray, at top left) The military type of carrier, English police waistcoat carrier, or police tactical carrier most typically has a series of webbing, hook and loop, and snap type connectors on the front and back face. This permits the wearer to mount various gear to the carrier in many different configurations. This load carriage feature is an important part of uniform and operational design for police weapons teams and the military. In addition to load carriage, this type of carrier may include pockets for neck protection, side plates, groin plates, and backside protection. Because this style of carrier is not close fitting, sizing in this system is straightforward for both men and women, making custom fabrication unnecessary. Concealable carriers Edit Law enforcement carriers in some countries are concealable. The carrier holds the ballistic panels close to the wearer's body and a uniform shirt is worn over the carrier. This type of carrier must be designed to conform closely to the officer's body shape. For concealable armor to conform to the body it must be correctly fitted to a particular individual. Many programs specify full custom measurement and manufacturing of armor panels and carriers to ensure good fit and comfortable armor. Officers who are either female or significantly overweight have more difficulty in getting accurately measured and having comfortable armor fabricated.[68] Vest slips Edit A third textile layer is often found between the carrier and the ballistic components. The ballistic panels are covered in a coated pouch or slip. This slip provides the encapsulation of the ballistic materials. Slips are manufactured in two types: heat sealed hermetic slips and simple sewn slips. For some ballistic fibers such as Kevlar the slip is a critical part of the system. The slip prevents moisture from the user's body from saturating the ballistic materials. This protection from moisture cycling increases the useful life of the armor.[69][full citation needed]\n\nResearch Edit\n\nProgress in fiber math Edit In recent years, advances in material science have opened the door to the idea of a literal \"bulletproof vest\" able to stop handgun and rifle bullets with a soft textile vest, without the assistance of additional metal or ceramic plating. However, progress is moving at a slower rate compared to other technical disciplines. The most recent offering from Kevlar, Protera, was released in 1996. Current soft body armor can stop most handgun rounds (which has been the case for roughly 15 years[citation needed]), but armor plates are needed to stop rifle rounds and steel-core handgun rounds such as 7.62×25mm. The para-aramids have not progressed beyond the limit of 23 grams per denier in fiber tenacity. Modest ballistic performance improvements have been made by new producers of this fiber type.[70] Much the same can be said for the UHMWPE material; the basic fiber properties have only advanced to the 30–35 g/d range. Improvements in this material have been seen in the development of cross-plied non-woven laminate, e.g. Spectra Shield. The major ballistic performance advance of fiber PBO is known as a \"cautionary tale\" in materials science.[71] This fiber permitted the design of handgun soft armor that was 30–50% lower in mass as compared to the aramid and UHMWPE materials. However this higher tenacity was delivered with a well-publicized weakness in environmental durability. Akzo-Magellan (now DuPont) teams have been working on fiber called M5 fiber; however, its announced startup of its pilot plant has been delayed more than 2 years. Data suggests if the M5 material can be brought to market, its performance will be roughly equivalent to PBO.[72] In May 2008, the Teijin Aramid group announced a “super-fibers” development program. The Teijin emphasis appears to be on computational chemistry to define a solution to high tenacity without environmental weakness. The materials science of second generation “super” fibers is complex, requires large investments, and represent significant technical challenges. Research aims to develop artificial spider silk which could be super strong, yet light and flexible.[73] Other research has been done to harness nanotechnology to help create super-strong fibers that could be used in future bulletproof vests. In 2018, the US military began conducting research into the feasibility of using artificial silk as body armor, which has the advantages of its light weight and its cooling capability.[74] Textile wovens and laminates research Edit Finer yarns and lighter woven fabrics have been a key factor in improved ballistic results. The cost of ballistic fiber goes up dramatically as yarn size goes down, so it is unclear how long this trend can continue. The current practical limit of fiber size is 200 denier with most wovens limited at the 400 denier level. Three-dimensional weaving with fibers connecting flat wovens together into a 3D system are being considered for both hard and soft ballistics. Team Engineering Inc is designing and weaving these multi layer materials. Dyneema DSM has developed higher performance laminates using a new, higher strength fiber designated SB61, and HB51. DSM feels this advanced material provides some improved performance, however the SB61 “soft ballistic” version has been recalled.[75] At the Shot Show in 2008, a unique composite of interlocking steel plates and soft UHWMPE plate was exhibited by TurtleSkin.[76] In combination with more traditional woven fabrics and laminates a number of research efforts are working with ballistic felts. Tex Tech has been working on these materials. Like the 3D weaving, Tex Tech sees the advantage in the 3-axis fiber orientation. Fibers used Edit Ballistic nylon (until the 1970) or Kevlar, Twaron[77] or Spectra (a competitor for Kevlar) or polyethylene fiber could be used to manufacture bullet proof vests. The vests of the time were made of ballistic nylon & supplemented by plates of fiber-glass, steel, ceramic, titanium, Doron & composites of ceramic and fiberglass, the last being the most effective. Manufacturing process Edit a. Making the panel cloth- 1. To make Kevlar cloth, the Kevlar yarns are woven in the simplest pattern, plain or tabby weave. which is merely the over & under pattern of threads that interlace alternatively. 2. Unlike Kevlar, the Spectra used in bulletproof vests is usually not woven. instead the strong polyethelene polymer filaments are spun into fibers that are then laid parallel to each other. Resin is used to coat the fibers, sealing them together to form a sheet of Spectra cloth. Two sheets of cloth are then placed at right angles to one another and again bonded, forming a nonwoven fabric that is next sandwiched between two sheets of polyethelene film. The vest shape can then be cut from the material. b. Cutting The panels- C. Sewing the ballistic panels- d. Finishing the vest- The shells for the panels are sewn together in the same standard industrial sewing machines and standard sewing practices. The panels are then slipped inside the shells and the accessories—such as the straps—are sewn on. The finished bulletproof vest is boxed and shipped to the customer. Working principle Edit When a hand gun bullet strikes body armor, it is caught in a \"web\" of extremely strong fibers. These fibers absorb and disperse the impact energy that is transmitted to the bullet proof vest from the bullet causing the bullet to deform, otherwise known as a \"mushroom\". Additional energy is absorbed by each successive layer or material in bullet proof vests until such time as the bullet has been stopped. Ceramic plates work by locally shattering where the projectile strikes, and are capable of dispersing the energy of the projectile to the point where the bullet has been stopped. Unfortunately, this means that ceramic plates become progressively less capable of stopping additional bullets, and may be rendered unusable after a certain number of hits have been taken. Developments in ceramic armor Edit Ceramic materials, materials processing and progress in ceramic penetration mechanics are significant areas of academic and industrial activity. This combined field of ceramics armor research is broad and is perhaps summarized best by The American Ceramics Society. ACerS has run an annual armor conference for a number of years and compiled a proceedings 2004–2007.[78] An area of special activity pertaining to vests is the emerging use of small ceramic components. Large torso sized ceramic plates are complex to manufacture and are subject to cracking in use. Monolithic plates also have limited multi hit capacity as a result of their large impact fracture zone These are the motivations for new types of armor plate. These new designs use two- and three-dimensional arrays of ceramic elements that can be rigid, flexible or semi-flexible. Dragon Skin body armor is one of these systems. European developments in spherical and hexagonal arrays have resulted in products that have some flex and multi hit performance.[79] The manufacture of array type systems with flex, consistent ballistic performance at edges of ceramic elements is an active area of research. In addition advanced ceramic processing techniques arrays require adhesive assembly methods. One novel approach is use of hook and loop fasteners to assemble the ceramic arrays.[80] Nanomaterials in ballistics Edit Currently, there are a number of methods by which nanomaterials are being implemented into body armor production. The first, developed at University of Delaware is based on nanoparticles within the suit that become rigid enough to protect the wearer as soon as a kinetic energy threshold is surpassed. These coatings have been described as shear thickening fluids.[81] These nano-infused fabrics have been licensed by BAE systems, but as of mid-2008, no products have been released based on this technology. In 2005 an Israeli company, ApNano, developed a material that was always rigid. It was announced that this nanocomposite based on tungsten disulfide nanotubes was able to withstand shocks generated by a steel projectile traveling at velocities of up to 1.5 km/s.[82] The material was also reportedly able to withstand shock pressures generated by other impacts of up to 250 metric tons-force per square centimeter (24.5 gigapascals; 3,550,000 psi). During the tests, the material proved to be so strong that after the impact the samples remained essentially unmarred. Additionally, a study in France tested the material under isostatic pressure and found it to be stable up to at least 350 tf/cm² (34 GPa; 5,000,000 psi). As of mid-2008, spider silk bulletproof vests and nano-based armors are being developed for potential market release.[citation needed] Both the British and American militaries have expressed interest in a carbon fiber woven from carbon nanotubes that was developed at University of Cambridge and has the potential to be used as body armor.[83] In 2008, large format carbon nanotube sheets began being produced at Nanocomp. Graphene composite Edit In late 2014, researchers began studying and testing graphene as a material for use in body armor. Graphene is manufactured from carbon and is the thinnest, strongest, and most conductive material on the planet. Taking the form of hexagonally arranged atoms, its tensile strength is known to be 200 times greater than steel, but studies from Rice University have revealed it is also 10 times better than steel at dissipating energy, an ability that had previously not been thoroughly explored. To test its properties, the University of Massachusetts stacked together graphene sheets only a single carbon atom thick, creating layers ranging in thickness from 10 nanometers to 100 nanometers from 300 layers. Microscopic spherical silica \"bullets\" were fired at the sheets at speeds of up to 3 km (1.9 mi) per second, almost nine times the speed of sound.

If the impact stress can be spread out over a large enough area that the cone moves out at an appreciable velocity compared with the velocity of the projectile, stress will not be localized under where it hit.

  "latent_19825": "Torontonians fancy the Downtown Relief Line (DRL) as their top transit priority, a recent poll reveals. Too bad. If history repeats itself, the “D” in DRL will morph into demoted, dethroned, derailed.\n\nDRL might as well stand for the Doomed Relief Line. But doomsday never comes.\n\nDespite a genealogy stretching back more than a century, constantly promoted and posited as the cure for the common downtown congestion, the DRL has been eclipsed more times than the sun and moon put together.\n\nBecause there’s something arresting about an idea whose leaves keep reappearing like those of a lopped-off banana plant. Maybe the 1910 Jacobs-Davies report was correct. Maybe, almost 60 years later, the TTC was right in telling the province:\n\nSo, why does the dog keep returning to its vomit?\n\n“This is a city that doesn’t miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity,” says Ed Levy, one of the deans of transit planning in Toronto. The DRL has “reappeared virtually every decade” since 1910, under different names. “It’s a long and tortuous history.”\n\nCall it DRL, Relief Line, Yonge Relief, Downtown Rapid Transit (DRT), Queen Street Subway, Underground Queen St. Streetcar, or — wash our mouth out — SmartTrack, the common denominator is “D” eventually ends in disrespect and disappointment.\n\nLately, its proponents have taken to removing the “D” — a shrewd move to avoid alerting the haters in the suburbs who sermonize that burghers from Scarborough and their 5,000 passengers per hour in the morning peak deserve a subway before the 30,000 strap-hangers spooned on the Yonge line trundling towards downtown.\n\nRarely does a transit study fail to include some iteration of the downtown relief line as a core need of the city’s transit system. Currently, the TTC, Metrolinx, City of Toronto planners and an untold number of consultants are studying its entrails. Again.\n\n“The Queen (Street) subway line is considered vital through the downtown area to provide east-west access to the developing core . . . Increasing high-density development in the Thorncliffe, Flemingdon Park and Don Mills-Eglinton areas already indicate that this line should be extended northerly to terminate north of Eglinton Avenue.”\n\nThe city’s chief planner wants it. TTC boss Andy Byford backs it. Transit geeks salivate over it. Veteran transit watchers weep over its delay.\n\nAnd still it languishes — this time, sidelined and maybe derailed by SmartTrack, the new hot thing, Mayor John Tory’s baby. SmartTrack would cost maybe $8 billion, duplicate some of the current GO service, render redundant portions of the Scarborough Subway route and replicate some of the DRL service; but it has currency and political capital.\n\nY’know how politics tend to trump commonsense. Maybe, that’s at play here. Or maybe city councillors are wise to be questioning the DRL dogma.\n\n“We are being told by the chief planner (Jennifer Keesmaat) and the transit intelligentsia that this is the be-all and end-all, the silver bullet,” says TTC chair Josh Colle, sounding awfully skeptical. With the full press on to promote the DRL, public approval should be at 70 per cent, not the 29 per cent who say it is the city’s most urgent need, he says.\n\nCouncillor Joe Mihevc, a transit-friendly, left-wing, midtown transit commissioner, surprises with this:\n\n“What we have is a (capacity) problem for four hours of the day, two in the a.m. and two in the p.m.,” Mihevc says. “The rest of the time it will be a white elephant, I truly believe that.”\n\nThe DRL is something for the next generation, he says. Ouch. They said that in 1911. And in 1975.\n\nSkepticism mounts even as citizens rediscover downtown and office towers sprout nearby to take advantage of a burgeoning downtown workforce.\n\nA Neptis Foundation study in late 2013 suggested a shuttle service on existing GO Transit lines, running from Main subway to Union, could supplant the need for a DRL and cost a few hundred million dollars.\n\nDRL lovers remain apoplectic over that claim from Michael Schabas.\n\nFigures in a report last May from chief planner Keesmaat, a DRL supporter, haven’t advanced the cause. It says the new subway cars will accommodate 10 per cent more passengers; the opening of the Spadina subway extension will relieve demand on the Yonge line by 5 per cent to 10 percent; and upgrades to the subway signal system (automatic train control) will add 25 per cent capacity on the Yonge line.\n\nVeteran transit watcher, planner and teacher Richard Soberman, now retired, doesn’t buy the freed-up capacity claims from ATC.\n\n“Balderdash! Says the guy who wrote the textbook when I was young and still honest,” Soberman writes in an email.\n\nWith all that new capacity, maybe the DRL can be deferred into the future, detractors say.\n\nBrady Yauch, of the Consumer Policy Institute, a quiet think tank founded by urban guru Jane Jacobs in the 1990s, released a paper last year slamming the DRL designs as too costly and unnecessary.\n\nRevamp the TTC’s flat-fare policy, Yauch recommends. In fact, it would be cheaper for the TTC to offer free transit before the morning peak. The measure would divert 1.5 per cent of riders, he estimates, and the lost revenue would pale in comparison to the cost of the DRL — ranging from $3 billion to $8 billion, depending on the option chosen.\n\n“It would solve the crowding issues currently experienced on the Yonge subway line, while saving the transit agency and its customers billions of dollars ($1.5 billion over the next 10 years) in not having to build an expensive subway,” he said.\n\nDRL proponents grow frustrated as detractors peck away at single elements of the advantages of the DRL, while ignoring its essential benefit: creating a crucial link in a missing network.\n\nThe DRL is supposed to:\n\nDivert passengers off the Bloor-Danforth line before they squeeze into Bloor-Yonge or Bloor-St. George, the TTC’s colossal chokepoints. By 2031, passenger movements at Bloor-Yonge will jump by 45 per cent, planners estimate. The terminally under-designed Bloor-Yonge interchange is considered one of the TTC’s biggest blunders of the last century.\n\nMove passengers off the Yonge line, already near capacity.\n\nProvide routes into the downtown core from east and west, a desperate need for a system that is dangerously dependent on the Yonge-University line. If something breaks or blows up in that corridor, the city grinds to a halt, they fear. This begins to provide some network flexibility.\n\nRelieve the frustrated urbanites now flocking to condo communities on the shoulders of the downtown, but unable to board the King or Queen streetcars as needed, or challenged to stomach the crammed streetcars from Liberty Village, for example.\n\nServe a downtown core that is the envy of most in North America — population expected to jump 83 per cent to 130,000 people; employment pushing up 28 per cent to above 400,000 jobs by the year 2031. Transit demand in the downtown core is projected to increase 55 per cent over this time.\n\nRun along King or Queen in the downtown segment, opening the opportunity to create two Union Station-like terminals, east and west of Union, and provide capacity to the country’s busiest and most critical transportation corridor. Under current projections, Union Station will absorb all its capacity a few years after the current expansion is completed.\n\nMetrolinx reported last June that its joint study has rejected several solutions as “not feasible.” They include new subway from Bay to Union, subway lines below existing ones, express trains, creating a by-pass track at every subway station, running longer trains, and others.\n\n“My view is that, even with other improvements, a relief line will be needed,” says Andy Byford, clinging to a position he’s held since becoming CEO at the TTC. “Until and unless I see data that suggests otherwise, I shall not be swayed from that view.”\n\nByford has seen data that factors in the positive benefits of ATC, new trains, and other measures. “But the modelling still showed that by 2031, Line 1 would be unable to cope — especially at Yonge and Bloor‎. The other initiatives will help, and SmartTrack will have positive impact, but my strong sense is that these will only delay, not obviate, the need for the (D)RL.”\n\nByford says the modelling being undertaken will deliver the definitive answers. But some of the very planners and consultants who’ve done similar studies over the years trust neither the process nor the outcome.\n\n“We all know that any study initiated by any mayor or premier always clearly demonstrates that the hypothesis is correct — whether it’s Sheppard subway follies (Mel Lastman) or LRT Mania (David Miller),” says Soberman.\n\n“This is what is fundamentally wrong when the mayor of the day is also the chief planner, and planning heads either corroborate these ideas through extensive use of consultants, or simply remain silent.”\n\nDavid Crowley used to be a service planner at TTC. He spends a lot of time looking at transportation demand studies and is fearful that historical mistakes will come back to bite the city. The DRL will help correct the mistake of a missing transit hub or distributor or network that takes commuters from point A to any other point in the region.\n\n“If we continue to rationalize away such visionary prospects, stagnation could well be our fate,” says Levy. “The DRL is, sadly, out of reach now, but we must uphold the vision.”\n\nRoyson James usually appears Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday.

  "latent_20000": "By STEPHEN KING\n\nHARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE\n\nBy J. K. Rowling.\n\n734 pp. New York:\n\nLevine Books/Scholastic Press. $25.95.\n\nread the first novel in the Harry Potter series, ''Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone,'' in April 1999 and was only moderately impressed. But in April 1999 I was pretty much all right. Two months later I was involved in a serious road accident that necessitated a long and painful period of recuperation. During the early part of this period I read Potters 2 and 3 (''Chamber of Secrets,'' ''Prisoner of Azkaban'') and found myself a lot more than moderately wowed. In the miserably hot summer of '99, the Harry Potters (and the superb detective novels of Dennis Lehane) became a kind of lifeline for me. During July and August I found myself getting through my unpleasant days by aiming my expectations at evening, when I would drag my hardware-encumbered leg into the kitchen, eat fresh fruit and ice cream and read about Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts, a school for young wizards (motto: ''Never tickle a sleeping dragon'').\n\nFor that reason, I awaited this summer's installment in J. K. Rowling's magical saga with almost as much interest as any Potter-besotted kid. I had enjoyed the first three, but had read the latter two while taking enough painkillers to levitate a horse. This summer, that's not the case.\n\nI'm relieved to report that Potter 4 -- ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' -- is every bit as good as Potters 1 through 3. It's longer, though. ''Goblet'' is as long as ''Chamber'' and ''Prisoner'' combined. Is it more textured than the first three? More thought-provoking? Sorry, no. Are such things necessary in a fantasy-adventure aimed primarily at children and published in the lush green heart of summer vacation? Of course not. What kids on summer vacation want -- and probably deserve -- is simple, uncomplicated fun. ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire'' brings the fun, and not just in stingy little buckets. At 734 pages, ''Goblet'' brings it by the lorry load.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this book is that Rowling's punning, one-eyebrow-cocked sense of humor goes the distance. At 700-plus pages, one should eventually tire of Blast-Ended Skrewts, Swedish Short-Snout dragons and devices like the Quick-Quotes Quill (a kind of magical tape recorder employed by the satisfyingly repugnant Daily Prophet reporter Rita Skeeter), but one never does. At the least this reader did not. Perhaps that's because Rowling doesn't dwell for long on such amusing inventions as the Quill, which floats in midair and bursts out with florid bits of tabloid prose at odd moments. She gives the reader a quick wink and a giggle before hustling him or her along again, all the while telling her tale at top speed. We go with this willingly enough, smiling bemusedly and waiting for the next nudge, wink and raised eyebrow.\n\nIn a Newsweek interview with Malcolm Jones, Rowling admitted to reading Tolkien rather late in the game, but it's hard to believe she hasn't read her Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers. Although they bear the trappings of fantasy, and the mingling of the real world and the world of wizards and flying broomsticks is delightful, the Harry Potter books are, at heart, satisfyingly shrewd mystery tales. Potter 3 (''Azkaban'') dealt with Harry's parents (like all good boy heroes, Harry's an orphan) and cleared up the multiple mysteries of their deaths in a way that would likely have pleased Ross Macdonald, that longtime creator of hidden pasts and convoluted family trees.\n\nNow, returning to Hogwarts after attending the Quidditch World Cup, Harry and his friends are excited to learn that the Triwizard Tournament is to be reintroduced after a hiatus of 100 years or so (too many of the young contestants wound up dead, it seems). Aspiring wizards from two other schools (Beauxbatons and the amusingly fascistic Durmstrang Academy, location unknown) have been invited to spend the year at Hogwarts and compete in the contest, which is composed of three beautifully imagined tasks. These can only be performed well by contestants who can solve the riddles that bear on them; both children and students of Greek mythology will enjoy this aspect of Rowling's tale.\n\nLike the Sorting Hat, one of Rowling's early ingenious bits of invention, the Goblet of Fire is essentially a choosing device. It's supposed to spit out three flaming bits of parchment bearing the names of the three contestants in the tournament, one entrant from each school. In a vivid and marvelously tense scene, the Goblet of Fire spits out four parchment fragments instead of three. The fourth, of course, bears the name of Our Hero. Although Harry is supposedly too young to compete in such a dangerous series of tilts, the Goblet has spoken, and of course Harry must step into the arena. If you think young readers won't lap this up, you never had one in your house (or were one yourself). Adults are apt to be more interested in just how Harry's name got into the Goblet in the first place. This is a mystery Rowling works out with snap and verve. And, unlike the denouements I remember from the Nancy Drew and Hardy Boys mysteries of my youth, where the culprit usually turned out to be some vile tramp of the lower classes, the solution to the Goblet mystery, like the answers to the Triwizard riddles, struck me as fair enough.\n\nA long the way, Rowling gives us Harry's first date (not with the alluring fifth-level dream girl Cho Chang, unfortunately), at least one thought-provoking subplot (involving house-elves who rather enjoy their status as kitchen slaves) and an extremely large dose of adolescent humor (one mildly off-color joke, punning on the word Uranus, will likely go over the heads of most grade-school readers and amuse the brighter junior high school set). There's also a moderately tiresome amount of adolescent squabbling. Adults can safely speed through these bits; it's a teenage thing.\n\nCan anyone wonder at the fabulous sales success of these books? The Harry Potter series is a supernatural version of ''Tom Brown's Schooldays,'' updated and given a hip this-is-how-kids-really-are shine. And Harry is the kid most children feel themselves to be, adrift in a world of unimaginative and often unpleasant adults -- Muggles, Rowling calls them -- who neither understand them nor care to. Harry is, in fact, a male Cinderella, waiting for someone to invite him to the ball. In Potter 1, his invitation comes first by owl (in the magic world of J. K. Rowling, owls deliver the mail) and then by Sorting Hat; in the current volume it comes from the Goblet of Fire, smoldering and shedding glamorous sparks. How nice to be invited to the ball! Even for a relatively old codger like me, it's still nice to be invited to the ball.\n\nIt would be depressing to announce that the best-selling book in the history of the world, a position this book will probably hold only until Potter 5 comes along, is a stinker. ''Goblet of Fire'' is far from that. Before Harry appeared on the scene, escape-hungry kids had to make do with R. L. Stine, the uninspired but wildly successful journeyman who inspired the ''Goosebumps'' phenomenon. Rowling's books are better natured, better plotted and better written. They bulge with the sort of playful details of which only British fantasists seem capable: there's the Whomping Willow, which will smash hell out of your car (and you) if you get too close to it, snack foods like Cauldron Cakes and Licorice Wands and the satisfyingly evil Lord Voldemort (so evil, in fact, that most of Rowling's characters will only call him ''You-know-who''). The Dursleys, Harry's unpleasant guardians, explain the boy's long absences by telling their friends that Harry attends St. Brutus's Secure Center for Incurably Criminal Boys. And the book opens with the murder (offstage, don't worry) of a witch named Bertha Jorkins. Rowling doesn't exactly come out and say it's what the unfortunate Bertha deserves for taking her vacation in Albania, but she certainly implies it.\n\nIs there more going on here than fun? Again, not much. In a good deal of British fantasy fiction, the amusing inventions are balanced by themes of increasing darkness -- Tolkien's ''Rings'' trilogy, for instance, in which the fascism of Mordor begins as a distant bad smell on the breeze and develops into a pervasive atmosphere of dread, or C. S. Lewis's Narnia books, in which the writer's religious concerns invest what begin as harmless make-believe adventures with a significance that becomes, in the end, almost unbearable (and to this reader, rather tiresome). Taken to its extreme, the id of British fantasy produces a Richard Adams, where the unfortunate talking dogs Snitter and Rowf suffer almost unspeakable hardships and the bear-god Shardik comes to stand for all the promises religion ever made and then broke; where every sunlit field of scampering rabbits conceals its shining wire of death.\n\nIn Rowling's work, such shadows can be perceived, but they are thin shadows, quickly dispelled. Harry's adventures remain for the most part upbeat and sunny, despite the occasional cold pockets of gruel; more Lewis Carroll than George Orwell. The British fantasy they may actually be closest to is J. M. Barrie's ''Peter Pan.'' Like any school, where the clientele is perpetually young and even the teachers begin to assume the immature psychological characteristics of their pupils, Hogwarts is a kind of Never-Never Land. Yet Harry and his friends show some reassuring signs of growing up eventually. In the current volume there is some discreet necking, and at least a few sorrows and disappointments that need coping with.\n\nThe fantasy writer's job is to conduct the willing reader from mundanity to magic. This is a feat of which only a superior imagination is capable, and Rowling possesses such equipment. She has said repeatedly that the Potter novels are not consciously aimed at any particular audience or age. The reader may reasonably question that assertion after reading the first book in the series, but by the time he or she has reached ''Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire,'' it becomes increasingly clear that the lady means what she says. Nor can there be any question that her stated refusal to dumb down the language of the books (the current one is presented with such British terms as petrol, pub and cuppa unchanged) has lent the stories an attraction to adults that most children's novels simply don't have.\n\nNot all the news is good. Harry Potter will soon be appearing at a multiplex near you. The initial project is being helmed by Chris Columbus, a filmmaker of no demonstrable ingenuity; one doubts if the director of ''The Goonies,'' one of the loudest, dumbest and most shriekingly annoying children's movies ever made, is up to bringing Rowling's scatty wit and vibrant imagination to the screen. (I hope, on behalf of the millions of children who love Harry, Hermione and Ron Weasley, that Columbus will prove me wrong.) Fantasy, even that as sturdy and uncomplicated as this Young Wizard's Progress, is difficult to bring to film, where the wonders are all too often apt to shrink and become banal. Perhaps Harry Potter's place is in the imaginations of his readers. And if these millions of readers are awakened to the wonders and rewards of fantasy at 11 or 12 . . . well, when they get to age 16 or so, there's this guy named King.",
  "latent_20153": "Harmony Corruption\n\nThere’s no more overused an adjective than legendary. ‘Legend’ used to be reserved those men and achievements that surpassed the norms of everyday experience. Now it is called into service to validate everything from the engine of a Dodge pickup truck to the onion rings at the local diner. If ever the term was properly applied, it would be to Jon “Metalion” Kristianson and his Slayer fanzine. In 2011, Brooklyn’s Bazillion Points Books collected the issues of Slayer, and paired them with extensive commentary from Kristiansen himself, creating an important document about the darkest corners of underground metal.\n\nHeavy metal experienced a rebirth in the 1980s, which is frequently misunderstood. By 1985 the primal, simplifying force of Black Sabbath had spent itself, and the hair and makeup of bands like Mötley Crüe, Ratt, and Poison were the order of the day. In these years, underground metal grew up. It followed a path similar to that of hardcore punk, adopting a paired down, no bullshit approach, as a means of both reaching back to the authentic basis of the style, while at the same time creating a space for extra- (and anti-) social identity formation.\n\nMetalion and Slayer were central figures in this rebirth. Based in the Norwegian town of Sarpsborg, Kristiansen was confronted with the problems of alienation and isolation so common among adolescents born far from the metropolitan centers of the industrialized world. His response was to exercise his own creativity while making use of the networks of communication available to him. In those days this amounted to trading cassettes among bands and other enthusiasts for the nascent extreme metal scene. Metalion was, by his own estimation, one of the most prolific correspondents and tape traders of that era. According to Kristianson, he sent out around 30,000 letters in the decade following 1983.\n\nThe growth of this scene in urban areas (particularly in Sweden) has been well documented, for instance books such as Swedish Death Metal by former Insision bassist Daniel Ekeroth. The history of Metalion’s Slayer, and of his creation of a network of correspondents that quite literally spanned the globe, describes the trajectory of the extreme metal underground from a perspective that is both external and internal. Metalion did not have regular, day to day access to spaces in which the urban metal scenes (such as those in Stockholm or Olso) percolated. But the web of connections that he created put him at the center of a stylistic and ideational world of extreme metal.\n\nAs an artifact of the underground metal scene, Slayer itself was the stuff of legend. In an era when the “thank you” lists that accompanied records acted as a means of solidifying associative networks, Metalion and Slayer were ubiquitous. From Napalm Death to Entombed, from Sadistik Exekution to Mayhem, there seemed to be no corner of the underground metal community beyond their reach. More than just documenting various points of interest, Slayer was a finger on the pulse of a multifaceted developing creative enterprise. Bands such as the aformentioned Mayhem, Morbid Angel, and Entombed were featured repeatedly, tracking their creative development and allowing readers to keep up to speed.\n\nThere is an element of vulnerability to Metalion, that makes his narrative both attractive and plausible. Strangely, for a guy who was personally acquainted with church burners, grave violators, and murderers, Metalion confesses to being intimidated by the punk rockers at a Doom show in 1988.\n\nOne of the most fascinating aspects of Metalion’s life in underground culture is the connection that he forged early on with figures who would figure prominently in the Norwegian black metal scene. Since the spectacular series of killings and church burnings brought them to prominence in the mid-1990s, the Norwegian black metal scene has been the subject of a wide range of appraisals. From Moynihan and Søderlind’s fawning Lords of Chaos to the recent spate of documentaries, such as Aaron Aites and Audrey Ewell’s Until the Light Takes Us, the voices that one hears tend to be those with a stake in the meaning and significance of the history. The virtue of Metalion’s voice is that is it based in his own broader tastes, but also in the humanity of his relationships.\n\nMetalion met Euronymous in the earliest days of Mayhem. He became friends with Per Yngve “Dead” Ohlin when he moved from Sweden to join the band and watched him struggle with poverty in a foreign environment. In Kristianson’s telling, the pretension and agendas of Mayhem’s early history are stripped away. His explanation of the early role of corpse paint in the black metal scene illustrates this:\n\n“Those guys [Mayhem] never went out to shows wearing corpse paint. Euronymous did, but not until much later. I think that some misconceptions grew after some photos circulated which were taken in the basement of Euronymous’ parents’ house. In the pictures, the Mayhem guys are fully decked out, and in the background is an ordinary living room, which gave people the impression that they lounged around in corpse paint, which was never true.”\n\nLacking the desire to make the early history of Norwegian black metal into anything more than it was, Metalion speaks in a voice now bemused, now tragic. He explanation of the death by suicide of Pelle Ohlin is in many respects more objective than that presented by some other contemporaries. For him, unlike for those in the band itself, Per Yngve was principally a friend, rather than someone whose peculiarities can be exploited. Kristiansen’s telling of his experience of cleaning blood off the walls of the room where Ohlin killed himself, while Ohlin’s bandmate Euronymous made jewelry out of pieces of the dead man’s skull, is one of the most compelling moments in the narrative. The contrast between Metalion’s humane reactions, his inability to mourn the loss of his friend, presents a powerful contrast to the self-serving and self-involved responses of Ohlin’s bandmates.\n\nMetalion: The Slayer Mag Diaries provides the reader with a wealth of information. The reprints of the issues of Slayer itself are crucial, given that the originals were never seen by more than a few thousand people worldwide. Coupled with Metalion’s biographical narrative, the reader is provided with a level of human detail that makes the underground metal scene into a human enterprise rather than leaving it to the self promotion of the bands that composed the business end of the scene.\n\nThis in itself is unusual. The history of underground scenes is rife with the retellings of band members, composed in the key of the self promotion implicit in being in a band in the first place. This is particularly true of the underground metal community, with its we’re-the best because we-say-we are ideology. Two years after its initial English-language publication, Metalion remains of intense interest, both for scene vets, and those who curious about its various histories. Here’s to more books like it.\n\nPhotograph courtesy of Metal Chris. Published under a Creative Commons license.",

  "latent_20269": "Bill Clark/Getty Images\n\nThe AP projects that Tea Party star Ted Cruz will win the Texas Republican Senate primary, defeating \"establishment\" candidate and longtime Lieutenant Gov. David Dewhurst.\n\nIn the past several weeks victory for Cruz, the former solicitor general, had begun to look increasingly likely, with polls showing him ahead of Dewhurst, and major national Tea Party stars like Sarah Palin and Sen. Jim DeMint turning out to campaign for him in the final days leading up to the runoff. However, for the bulk of the race Cruz had been the underdog, lacking in the wealth and name recognition enjoyed by Dewhurst, who has been the lieutenant governor under Rick Perry since 2003.\n\nWhile Cruz, 41, may have had the majority of national star power on his side, Dewhurst, 66, had the backing of many in the Texas political establishment, including Perry. Dewhurst enjoyed a huge financial advantage over Cruz. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Dewhurst poured $11 million of his own personal fortune- he founded a successful energy company called Falcon Seaboard- into his campaign, spending a total of $19 million, as compared to Cruz's $7 million spent. But ultimately Dewhurst's wallet was no match for Cruz's political prowess.\n\nCruz painted his opponent as a moderate who would be willing, if not eager, to compromise with Democrats in Congress. Dewhurst has a very conservative record- he's anti-abortion rights, he supports a balanced budget amendment, and on Monday morning he stopped by a Chick-Fil-A to show his support for the restaurant embroiled in a controversy regarding their president's recent comments on gay marriage. Nevertheless, Cruz and his supporters pointed to compromises Dewhurst had made with Democrats in the state legislature, and argued that his record was merely a reflection of Rick Perry's conservative agenda and did not provide an accurate representation of Dewhurst's own governing style.\n\nGet more pure politics at ABC News.com/Politics and a lighter take on the news at OTUSNews.com\n\nThe two men battled fiercely, neither imploded at any time, neither veered off their course, and the race remained close throughout the two months in between the state and presidential primary on May 29, when no one candidate received more than 50 percent of the vote, forcing a runoff. But in the end, strong poll numbers, strong surrogates and a slew of outside spending money from Tea Party affiliated groups like \"FreedomWorks\" and \"Club For Growth\" came together to give Cruz momentum that carried him over the finish line.\n\nCruz will go up against Democratic challenger state Rep. Paul Sadler in the fall in the open race to fill the seat left open by Kay Bailey Hutchison's retirement, but he is widely expected to win because of the state's strong Republican leanings.",

These Pulled Portobello Tacos are easy to make and absolutely delicious!\n\nIf you’re up to date with all the food trends, you probably have heard about or even tried Pulled Jackfruit. But did you know that you can make an easy and delicious vegan alternative to pulled pork with portobello mushrooms as well?\n\nI love using portobellos because they are much easier to get than young jackfruit in brine (although most Asian markets should have them). I think it’s a really, really good alternative. You can use this pulled portobello in wraps, burgers, on pizza, or in tacos (like I did for this recipe).\n\nI’ve also used no oil in this recipe because the mushrooms are filled with lots water, they won’t stick to the pan. And for the onions, you can simply caramelize them by adding water little by little if they stick to the pan.\n\nThe process of making vegan Pulled Portobellos is rather simple. Cook them in a pan over medium to high heat until they’ve lost most of the water. On the side, caramelize onions with water to make them oil-free. Once the portobellos are soft, add them to another bowl and pull them apart with two forks (don’t pull them apart it in the pan, or it will ruin the surface).\n\nThen transfer them back into the pan to the onions, mix everything together, add BBQ sauce and reheat until warm. Then you can use ‘the meat alternative’ in all kinds of dishes!\n\nHow to make hard shell tacos out of soft shell tacos\n\nThere’s a simple trick how you can make your own hard shell tacos if you only have soft tortillas at home.\n\nFold the soft tortillas over your oven rack.\n\nLet them bake for about 8-10 minutes at 350°F/180°C.\n\nThey should be nice and crispy! Easy as that, you have the perfect hard shell tacos for the Pulled Portobello Tacos ready.\n\nI’ve filled my tacos with mixed salad, pulled portobello, cherry tomatoes and Thai basil. Thai Basil is one of my favorite herbs right now. I’m growing it on the balcony and I love the taste of it, which is a bit like anise, a bit like licorice, but also reminds me of lime. It goes great together with the portobello. If you don’t have access to it, you could leave it out or sub it with cilantro maybe. That could work too :)\n\nVegan Pulled Portobello Tacos Pulled Portobello is a great vegetarian and vegan alternative to pulled pork.

It screened in various regional locations, including Kidderminster, Hull and Morecambe. It was given a simultaneous digital release.\n\nMomentum review – wooden thriller, Bourne too late Read more\n\nMomentum received largely negative reviews and has a 27% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Empire’s Ali Plumb called it “one of the worst films you won’t see in 2015”, while the Observer’s Mark Kermode referred to it as “utter pants” in his one-star review.\n\nIts director, Stephen Campanelli, worked alongside Clint Eastwood for 20 years as a camera operator on films such as Million Dollar Baby and American Sniper. “I did three movies with Morgan [while I was] a camera operator, and we’ve gotten along very well,” Campanelli told Geekscape. “We’ve become like friends, and he said to me, ‘When you get a movie and you get to direct it, if you have a role for me, I’d love to do it.’ Then this came out and I read the part of the senator’s role and I went, ‘Oh my God, Morgan would be perfect for this.’”\n\nFreeman, curiously, does not appear in any of the film’s marketing, which included underground posters in London.\n\nMomentum was conceived as the start of a new franchise with an open-ended finale that sets the film up for a sequel. “I don’t want to give away too much, but I definitely have some ideas for these people,” Campanelli said. “And Olga is excited. She’s really hoping this movie does well, because she really wants to do a sequel, too.”",

In that interview, Trump attempted to diminish Bannon's role in his 2016 election campaign, saying Bannon \"was not involved in my campaign until very late.

Revision History v1.0 2013-04-29 Initial release. v1.1 2013-04-29 Corrected patch URL. Additional workaround information. I. Background The Network File System (NFS) allows a host to export some or all of its file systems so that other hosts can access them over the network and mount them as if they were on local disks. FreeBSD includes server and client implementations of NFS. FreeBSD 8.0 and onward has two NFS implementations: the original CSRG NFSv2 and NFSv3 implementation and a new implementation which also supports NFSv4. FreeBSD 9.0 and onward uses the new NFS implementation by default. II. Problem Description When processing READDIR requests, the NFS server does not check that it is in fact operating on a directory node. An attacker can use a specially modified NFS client to submit a READDIR request on a file, causing the underlying filesystem to interpret that file as a directory. III. Impact The exact consequences of an attack depend on the amount of input validation in the underlying filesystem: - If the file resides on a UFS filesystem on a little-endian server, an attacker can cause random heap corruption with completely unpredictable consequences. - If the file resides on a ZFS filesystem, an attacker can write arbitrary data on the stack. It is believed, but has not been confirmed, that this can be exploited to run arbitrary code in kernel context. Other filesystems may also be vulnerable. IV. Workaround Systems that do not provide NFS service are not vulnerable. Neither are systems that do but use the old NFS implementation, which is the default in FreeBSD 8.x. To determine which implementation an NFS server is running, run the following command: # kldstat -v | grep -cw nfsd This will print 1 if the system is running the new NFS implementation, and 0 otherwise. To switch to the old NFS implementation: 1) Append the following lines to /etc/rc.conf: nfsv4_server_enable=\"no\" oldnfs_server_enable=\"yes\" 2) If the NFS server is compiled into the kernel (which is the case for the stock GENERIC kernel), replace the NFSD option with the NFSSERVER option, then recompile your kernel as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html>. If the NFS server is not compiled into the kernel, the correct module will be loaded at boot time. 3) Finally, reboot the system. V. Solution Perform one of the following: 1) Upgrade your vulnerable system to a supported FreeBSD stable or release / security branch (releng) dated after the correction date. 2) To update your vulnerable system via a source code patch: The following patches have been verified to apply to the applicable FreeBSD release branches. a) Download the relevant patch from the location below, and verify the detached PGP signature using your PGP utility. # fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:05/nfsserver.patch # fetch http://security.FreeBSD.org/patches/SA-13:05/nfsserver.patch.asc # gpg --verify nfsserver.patch.asc b) Apply the patch. # cd /usr/src # patch < /path/to/patch c) Recompile your kernel as described in <URL:http://www.FreeBSD.org/handbook/kernelconfig.html> and reboot the system. 3) To update your vulnerable system via a binary patch: Systems running a RELEASE version of FreeBSD on the i386 or amd64 platforms can be updated via the freebsd-update(8) utility: # freebsd-update fetch # freebsd-update install VI.

  "latent_20590": "NEW YORK — Without fanfare, the United Nations this week elected Iran to its Commission on the Status of Women, handing a four-year seat on the influential human rights body to a theocratic state in which stoning is enshrined in law and lashings are required for women judged \"immodest.\"\n\nJust days after Iran abandoned a high-profile bid for a seat on the U.N. Human Rights Council, it began a covert campaign to claim a seat on the Commission on the Status of Women, which is \"dedicated exclusively to gender equality and advancement of women,\" according to its website.\n\nBuried 2,000 words deep in a U.N. press release distributed Wednesday on the filling of \"vacancies in subsidiary bodies,\" was the stark announcement: Iran, along with representatives from 10 other nations, was \"elected by acclamation,\" meaning that no open vote was requested or required by any member states — including the United States. FOXNews.com learned of the press release only after being alerted to it by Anne Bayefsky director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust.\n\nThe U.S. currently holds one of the 45 seats on the body, a position set to expire in 2012. The U.S. Mission to the U.N. did not return requests for comment on whether it actively opposed elevating Iran to the women's commission.\n\nIran's election comes just a week after one of its senior clerics declared that women who wear revealing clothing are to blame for earthquakes, a statement that created an international uproar — but little affected their bid to become an international arbiter of women's rights.\n\n\"Many women who do not dress modestly ... lead young men astray, corrupt their chastity and spread adultery in society, which (consequently) increases earthquakes,\" said the respected cleric, Hojatoleslam Kazem Sedighi.\n\nAs word of Iran's intention to join the women's commission came out, a group of Iranian activists circulated a petition to the U.N. asking that member states oppose its election.\n\n\"Iran's discriminatory laws demonstrate that the Islamic Republic does not believe in gender equality,\" reads the letter, signed by 214 activists and endorsed by over a dozen human rights bodies.\n\nThe letter draws a dark picture of the status of women in Iran: \"women lack the ability to choose their husbands, have no independent right to education after marriage, no right to divorce, no right to child custody, have no protection from violent treatment in public spaces, are restricted by quotas for women's admission at universities, and are arrested, beaten, and imprisoned for peacefully seeking change of such laws.\"\n\nThe Commission on the Status of Women is supposed to conduct review of nations that violate women's rights, issue reports detailing their failings, and monitor their success in improving women's equality.\n\nYet critics of Iran's human rights record say the country has taken \"every conceivable step\" to deter women's equality.\n\n\"In the past year, it has arrested and jailed mothers of peaceful civil rights protesters,\" wrote three prominent democracy and human rights activists in an op-ed published online Tuesday by Foreign Policy Magazine.\n\n\"It has charged women who were seeking equality in the social sphere — as wives, daughters and mothers — with threatening national security, subjecting many to hours of harrowing interrogation. Its prison guards have beaten, tortured, sexually assaulted and raped female and male civil rights protesters.\"\n\nClick here for more on Iran's human rights record.\n\nIran's elevation to the commission comes as a black eye just days after the U.S. helped lead a successful effort to keep Iran off the Human Rights Council, which is already dominated by nations that are judged by human rights advocates as chronic violators of essential freedoms. The current membership of the women's commission is little different.\n\nThough it touts itself as \"the principal global policy-making body\" on women's rights, the makeup of the commission is mostly determined by geography and its membership is a hodge-podge of some human rights advocates (including the U.S., Japan, and Germany) and other nations with stark histories of rights violations.\n\nThe number of seats on the commission is based on the number of countries in a region, no matter how small their populations or how scant their respect for rights. The commission is currently made up of 13 members from Africa, 11 from Asia, nine from Latin America and the Caribbean, eight from Western Europe and North America, and four from Eastern Europe.\n\nDuring this round of \"elections,\" which were not competitive and in which no real votes were cast, two seats opened up for the Asian bloc for the 2011-2015 period. Only two nations put forward candidates to fill empty spots — Iran and Thailand. As at most such commissions in the U.N., backroom deals determined who would gain new seats at the women's rights body.\n\nThe activists' letter sent to the U.N. Tuesday argued that it would be better if the Asian countries proffered only one candidate, instead of elevating Iran to the commission.\n\n\"We, a group of gender-equality activists, believe that for the sake of women's rights globally, an empty seat for the Asia group on (the commission) is much preferable to Iran's membership. We are writing to alert you to the highly negative ramifications of Iran’s membership in this international body.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the U.N.'s Department of Economic and Social Affairs, which oversees the commission, did not return phone calls or e-mails seeking comment.\n\nWhen its term begins in 2011, Iran will be joined by 10 other countries: Belgium, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Estonia, Georgia, Jamaica, Iran, Liberia, the Netherlands, Spain, Thailand and Zimbabwe.",

  "latent_20720": "The recent drop in energy prices has dominated financial headlines in recent months, with the fallout having been wide ranging and somewhat conflicting. Consumers have received what amounts to a tax cut, and with more money to spend that’s good news for retailers. At the same time, stocks are experiencing a decent level of volatility, plagued by many of the same factors that are causing oil to plummet, including soft demand, a strong dollar and continued economic weakness across Europe, Japan and even China.\n\nReceiving far less press attention is the ongoing collapse of Bitcoin prices. While this is not unexpected given the house of cards Bitcoin was built on, no one should forget that only a short time ago Bitcoin had reached manic levels. Investors worldwide – including high-powered venture capital firms and well-respected tech entrepreneurs – sang its praises, pouring millions into the virtual currency and confidently declaring that it was the next big thing\n\nThat seems like a long time ago indeed. Since late 2013, when Bitcoin hit $1,200 its value has plunged more than 80%. If one of the purposes of a currency is to create stability across multiple marketplaces to empower smooth transactions between buyers and sellers, then Bitcoin has failed. At this point, it’s merely a speculative commodity, just like tulip bulbs centuries ago or even Beanie Babies more recently. And just like those fads, Bitcoin has peaked and is very unlikely to escalate significantly in value again.\n\nThe irony of Bitcoin’s fall is that some of the attributes that initially made it so attractive to its backers like no centralized banking control, lax regulation and no transaction fees, are the very same things that are actually causing its demise. These types of decentralized monetary systems never work, since valuations are allowed to fluctuate wildly and there is a lack of trust in the system. It’s simply not safe to hold Bitcoin. Look no further than the major exchanges, which have either gone bankrupt (Mt. Gox) or suffered major security lapses (Bitstamp). Both of which cost investors millions of dollars in unrecoverable losses.\n\nUltimately, one of Bitcoin’s biggest problems is the same retailers they are trying to convince to accept Bitcoin. The problem is that retailers that accept them, don’t hold them. Sure, in theory, some say they will take Bitcoin, but most immediately convert them into dollars – which means every time someone uses Bitcoin to pay for goods or services the currency loses value. It’s basically an elaborate Ponzi scheme. This is a major flaw in Bitcoin, if merchants don’t hold Bitcoin, every time they are used in a purchase they must be sold to someone else, forcing prices lower.\n\nBitcoin investors are missing the point. When it comes to paying for everyday items, the masses do not want a virtual currency that is difficult to understand, fluctuates wildly and operates in the shadows. What they want is convenience and safety and that means electronic mobile payments in dollars. Such a payment system is just scratching the surface in terms of its potential. To build on it, the major players will have to come together and merge existing technologies, not only to make the system more widely available but more efficient. As most Bitcoin pioneers say today. It’s not about Bitcoin, it’s about the technology. There is huge potential for mobile transactions in dollars.\n\nAs you might expect, Apple will play a major role. The company that transformed the music industry and basically changed the definition of the word ‘phone’ now needs to have a similar impact in the world of mobile and electronic payments. While Apple Pay was introduced last year, retailers have been slow to adopt the service, since it requires a significant investment in hardware. A recently announced partnership with Square could help solve this problem.\n\nOn the surface, Square, which is partly funded by Starbucks , is a natural fit to help take mobile and electronic payments to the next level. But the company has hit a wall recently, having picked all the low hanging fruit in the marketplace. This is an opportunity to harness the energy it took to enable thousands of small businesses nationwide to process credit card transactions and apply it to making Apple Pay more universal. Many retailers like Starbucks are building their own mobile payment apps. This creates more of a problem than a solution.\n\nMeanwhile, the traditional credit card companies – Visa , MasterCard and American Express – could also take part in this shift. Such companies make billions in swipe fees each year. Rather than see this revenue vanish, these firms should look to coalesce around this next wave in the industry – which is likely to take place with or without them. In other words, it would be wise to get on board and make the transition from debit and credit card purchases, just like everyone else. These companies have been big adaptors of the Apple Pay systems and are happy to participate as long as the fees are there. While one of the attractions of Bitcoin was that transactions are free, they have learned that to have security, regulation and efficiency costs money and those fees must be passed on to the consumer.\n\nAnother big winner could be PayPal, with millions of users already using it’s electronic payment system, PayPal just needs to take some steps to stay relevant. Spinning off the company this year from Ebay will help. We see Google or a credit card company jumping on PayPal as soon as they can. PayPal is a great asset that can be positioned for the future in mobile payments.\n\nGoogle and Microsoft could also be a player in mobile transactions. Google was a first mover with Google Wallet but they ultimately lack focus and don’t seem to have a strategy for it. With all of the Android users lacking a good payment system PayPal looks like a natural fit. Microsoft certainly has the cash and firepower to get into this directly or through Xbox and the video game space. Microsoft already processes millions in digital payments through the xbox for games. Why not extend that into an app for the phone and computer. In the end, it’s a matter of focus and effort. Both Google and Microsoft could certainly be successful in mobile payments if they wanted.\n\nJust because venture capitalists and tech investors embrace something, doesn't mean that it has value or, for that matter, is legitimate or sustainable. Such investors back many failed ideas and enterprises all the time. While I don’t relish anyone losing money, Bitcoin basically went out of the way to make itself vulnerable. For this reason, it is destined to fail.\n\nWhat’s more, most people don’t care about Bitcoin or some alternative currency. They just want to be able to buy things with their phones, in dollars. However, opportunities are abound in a field that people do care about – mobile and electronic payments. It’ll be interesting to see who takes advantage.\n\nRoss Gerber is CEO and president of Santa Monica, Calif-based Gerber Kawasaki, an investment advisory with approximately $315 million in assets under advisement.

At 5:42pm ET Saturday, the United Launch Alliance will blast the GOES-R satellite into space for NOAA. This new instrument will provide real-time data and images to aid in the forecasting various types of weather, from hurricanes on Earth to solar storms. NASA TV will provide live coverage beginning at 5:10pm ET.\n\nAll manner of superlatives have been applied to this first of a new generation of weather satellites—fastest, best, clearest—in terms of data and images beamed back to Earth. Mission scientists say GOES-R bridges the divide from an era when most people got their weather information at 10 from a TV personality to when everyone carries a 10-day forecast in their pocket. Or, they say, it is like going from black-and-white television to high-definition.\n\nSaturday's launch will be the first of four spacecraft in NOAA's GOES-R series, which is estimated to cost about $11 billion through 2035. The satellite will have three times the number of data channels as its most immediate predecessor, the GOES 15 that was launched in 2010 (GOES stands for \"Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite\"). The GOES-R improves every current GOES satellite product, while adding new information about lightning, smoke, fires, and volcanic ash, among other variables. The images it produces of weather systems on Earth will have four times the resolution of its predecessor. And with its new Advanced Baseline Imager, the satellite will have the capacity to scan major storm systems every 30 seconds and the entire western hemisphere five time faster.\n\nFor all of this, the delicate satellite must still make it safely into space before it can begin operations. We will find out Saturday—pending any weather and technical issues with the rocket—if that's the case. The GOES-R satellite will ride to space aboard an Atlas V 541 rocket, a variant that features four solid rocket boosters attached to a shared core.\n\nFollowing the launch, the rocket's upper stage will power the satellite deeper into space, toward a geostationary orbit nearly 36,000km from Earth. It will take 14 days to reach. The satellite will then remain in a \"checkout\" orbit for about a year, during which time the instrument will be validated, before it finally moves into an operational, geosynchronous orbit.\n\nListing image by United Launch Alliance",

You write programs in Albatross and prove them to be correct in the same language.\n\nWhat is a correct program? A program is correct if it is consistent with its specification. Specifications in Albatross are assertions which express correctness conditions. Assertions are boolean expressions in predicate logic.\n\nA verified Albatross program has as proof for each assertion. The proof is generated by the compiler.\n\nBut since assertions are expressed in predicate logic and predicate logic is not decidable for arbitrary expressions the theorem prover in the Albatross compiler cannot prove all valid assertions.\n\nTherefore the programmer has to provide the proof steps which cannot be done by the compiler automatically. The automation features have been designed with the following philosophy:\n\nThe compiler does all low level work that can be done efficiently without entering a huge search space.\n\nThe programmer has to provide the more intelligent steps which require some creativity.\n\nBecause of this philosophy the Albatross compiler is something between a proof assistant and a theorem prover.",

Roethlisberger said the only adjustments Bell might have to make returning to the field are dealing with some new things they have put into the offense while he was out.\n\n“I don’t foresee there being any issues,” said Roethlisberger. “If there are we will iron them out in the next couple of days. There are some things we have put in since he has been gone, but I fully expect him to pick up on it and be ready to go.\n\n“He has been working hard.

  "latent_21654": "Features\n\nThe Indigenous health gap: social factors hit hard\n\nby Bianca Nogrady\n\nThe link between overcrowded housing, ear infections and incarceration provides an insight into the complex relationship between health and social issues in Indigenous communities.\n\n[Image source: Ezra Shaw: Getty Images ]\n\nAustralia has long been called the lucky country. We have a life expectancy of 82 years, which places us in the top 10 countries in the world when it comes to lifespan.\n\nBut this isn't the case for all of us. Indigenous Australians have a ten-year lower life expectancy than non-Indigenous Australians. For Indigenous men, that figure is even worse. In theory, we all have access to all the same amenities, so why the difference?\n\nWhile the issue is complex, experts say much of the answer can be found in examining what are known as social determinants of health  factors like income, access to affordable housing, stress, age and race.\n\nSocial determinants of health The World Health Organization defines social determinants of health as the conditions in which we are born, grow up, live, work and age, and these \"are shaped by the distribution of money, power and resources at global, national and local levels\". These determinants are factors such as income, employment status, access to education, access to healthcare, access to affordable housing, transport, stress, age, and disability, and they have a greater impact on our risk of non-communicable chronic diseases  cancer, heart disease, diabetes, lung disease  than anything else. Indigenous Australians are impacted by these social determinants in different ways to non-Indigenous Australians, and they are also affected by other social determinants that play little or no role in the health of non-Indigenous Australia, such as racism.\n\nCrowded houses, ear infections and incarceration\n\nProfessor Dennis McDermott uses the example of housing to illustrate how social determinants can have a profound impact on Indigenous Australians' health.\n\n\"It's not hard to see how housing impacts on everyone in terms of health. But if you look at Indigenous Australia and look at the overcrowding that's there  and I'm thinking particularly of remote communities but you can get it also in urban settings  you might get 15 people living in a three bedroom house,\" says McDermott, from the Poche Centre for Indigenous Health and Wellbeing at Flinders University.\n\nAt this level of overcrowding, middle ear infections become a problem. Otitis media or middle ear infections  infections behind the ear drum  are very common in childhood and are usually caused by a viral or bacterial infection. Children often get them after they have a cold and usually they don't pose a serious problem, but in some cases ear infections can cause hearing problems that persist long after the original illness has passed.\n\n\"What happens is that non-Indigenous kids get it maybe once, they have a brush with it, and then it's gone. But with Indigenous kids in an overcrowded situation, it goes around and comes back, goes around and comes back, such that it's a huge impact on hearing loss.\"\n\nThis hearing loss can have ongoing, life-long effects. Children can't hear in school, adults can't hear on the job, it can impact on mental health, anger management, and wellbeing, McDermott says.\n\n\"Some recent research done in the Northern Territory looked at Aboriginal prisoners in Alice Springs and Darwin jail, … [and] they found that 90 per cent had significant hearing loss,\" he says.\n\n\"So what starts out as overcrowding ends up as incarceration issues.\"\n\nTreating glue ear is essential to help 'close the gap'\n\nRacism doubles the detriment\n\nBut it's not just about overcrowding, there are a range of social determinants that have a long-lasting detrimental impact on the health of Indigenous Australians.\n\nProfessor McDermott calls racism a 'sleeper issue' that is systemic in Australia, citing figures suggesting 97 per cent of Aboriginal Victorians have reported being on the receiving end of racism in the previous 12 months.\n\n\"It can be when you walk into a hospital and don't get the right treatment, or it can be overt; abuse or whatever,\" he says.\n\nWhatever form it takes, racism has a clear and proven negative physiological impact through its impact on stress hormones. The \"most staggering indication\" McDermott has seen was in the United States when stress experienced by certain racial groups increased after the September 11 Twin Towers attack and impacted on the birth weights of newborn babies.\n\n\"If you were a Californian woman, with an Arabic name, you were twice as likely to give birth to a low birth weight baby in the six months after that period,\" he says\n\nSimilarly, connection to country  or removal from it  has a proven impact on the health of Indigenous Australians.\n\nThere is hard evidence now that if you are \"back on country and you're doing some of the elements of traditional lifestyle\", your health will be better, McDermott says. For example, a 2009 study showed Indigenous participation in caring for country was significantly associated with more physical activity, better diet, lower body-mass index, lower blood pressure, lower blood glucose, less diabetes, and a lower risk of cardiovascular disease.\n\n\"You don't have to throw away your clothes or your mobile phone or whatever but if you're actually connected to country, you'll be better off.\n\n\"That psycho-spiritual connection to country, and doing these ceremonies, observing, burning the country when necessary…, is actually a positive contributor to health.\"\n\nTaking action\n\nInterestingly, Indigenous Australia is one of very few areas where social determinants of health are being addressed directly, through the Federal Government's Closing The Gap program, which flowed from the original non-government led 'Close The Gap' campaign.\n\nMartin Laverty, chair of the Social Determinants of Health Alliance, says this campaign has established a policy framework that has social determinants of health at its core.\n\n\"It's a social determinants action plan,\" says Laverty. \"In Indigenous affairs, we see a social determinants action plan that is informing how we are acting to improve Indigenous life expectancy and improve chronic illness.\"\n\nWhile it's relatively early days, Laverty says the strategy is kicking some goals.\n\n\"We've got targets and indicators for Indigenous school participation, housing, employment etc, and where you have clearly defined targets and indicators, you see resources shifted to improve those portfolio areas where targets are not being met,\" he says, pointing to improvements in child mortality and early childhood wellbeing from interventions around maternal and child health.\n\n\"Where we now need to see the next investment is on educational attainment and smoking cessation; those two on their own will likely have the most immediate positive impacts.\"\n\nIt may seem like an insurmountable task; changing the negative impact that social determinants have on the health of Indigenous Australians, but McDermott is positive about the prospects given the amount of evidence that is accumulating about what can be done to address social determinants of health.\n\n\"It's like climate change: the evidence is there but there's this huge denial, vested interests in actually not listening to the evidence,\" he says.\n\n\"I think if we can only get that message through and build a critical mass of discourse in the community, then the politicians will fall in line.\"\n\nThis article is one in a series looking at social determinants of health.

Here’s what we said at the time:\n\nA fixture at the station since its legalisation in 1990 (prior to Kiss, he’d run the Roots Rockers show on Capital and spent time on Radio London), Rodigan’s knowledge of Jamaican music is considered second to none, and his respect spans numerous generations.\n\nIn recent years Rodigan’s slot has been pushed to the station’s late night schedule, and today announced that he was leaving the station “due to their continued marginalisation of reggae music”.

  "latent_21859": "Starting Thursday in Michigan, a woman must purchase an additional insurance policy if she wants reimbursement for an abortion, unless her life is at stake.\n\nThe new law drops coverage of most abortions from existing policies -- even to terminate a pregnancy resulting from rape or incest. Women who buy their own individual policies, rather than getting coverage through an employer-based plan, won't be able to purchase the additional coverage, called an abortion rider, from Michigan insurers.\n\n“This law unfairly punishes women simply for being women,” state Rep. Marcia Hovey-Wright (D-Muskegon), chairwoman of the Women’s Democratic Caucus, said in a statement. “Women deserve the same access to full health care as men receive, but only women are told they must buy extra insurance to get it.\"\n\nThe Detroit Free Press reports that only seven insurers will offer abortion riders, and only to members of employee-sponsored plans.\n\nThere were 23,230 abortions in Michigan in 2012, and fewer than 4 percent were paid by insurers. A typical first-trimester abortion costs around $500. A study in the medical journal Women's Health Issues found that 14 percent of women who underwent abortions put off paying rent and 16 percent delayed buying food in order to pay for the procedure.\n\nLori Lamerand, CEO of Planned Parenthood of Mid and South Michigan, explained to The Huffington Post in an earlier article that abortion costs can soar to as much as $10,000 if the procedure is done in the second or third trimester, especially if it involves a hospital.\n\n\"An early trimester procedure is one thing, but if you consider a family that had to abort a child due to a medical issue -- at a time when a family would be experiencing an incredible tragedy, we will just be adding insult to injury,\" Lamerand said.\n\nSupporters of the Abortion Insurance Opt-Out Act said it allows people who oppose abortion from paying for health plans that cover the procedure.\n\nOpponents dubbed the law \"rape insurance,\" arguing that women would have to anticipate the possibility of being raped and purchase the insurance before the assault.\n\nMichigan's Republican-controlled state legislature first passed the measure in 2012, but Gov. Rick Snyder (R) vetoed it, arguing that it wasn't \"appropriate to tell a woman who becomes pregnant due to rape that she needed to select elective insurance coverage.\" Undeterred, Right To Life Michigan gathered 300,000 petition signatures supporting the measure, igniting the infrequently-used citizens initiative process. Both houses of the legislature passed the measure in December. There's no veto in the citizens initiative process, and Snyder's signature was unneeded for the law to go into effect.\n\nRep. Gary Peters (D-Mich), a candidate for Michigan's vacant seat in the U.S. Senate, pointed out that the measure was brought to the legislature by a \"special interest group\" representing about 4 percent of the state's population.\n\n\"As the father of two daughters, I struggle with how to tell them that the state we love and where our family has been for generations is now unfairly discriminating against them and makes health care less affordable,\" Peters said in a statement.\n\nOne of the most memorable moments of the emotionally charged debate was a speech by Michigan Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer (D- East Lansing), in which she revealed she had been raped in college and begged her colleagues to vote against the measure.\n\n\"This law is an attack on women’s health and their economic security, and it is an embarrassment to the state of Michigan,\" Hovey-Wright said.",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nConsidering that you can now find gluten-free everything, from Bisquick to bagels, it seems remarkable that our national obsession with the wheat protein that gives bread its elasticity is only about a decade old. Doctors have long known about a relatively rare condition called celiac disease, in which gluten damages the small intestine. But in recent years, best-selling books like Wheat Belly and Grain Brain have popularized the notion that gluten is the hidden culprit behind a host of hard-to-diagnose health problems, from indigestion to fatigue. Once you excise bread and other wheat products from your diet, the books claim, you’ll be on the path to everything from top mental performance to a svelte figure.\n\nThere’s no scientific consensus on how prevalent gluten sensitivity is, what triggers it, or even if it exists at all.\n\nThe message has been quite lucrative, and not just for publishers. According to the market research firm Mintel, sales of foods labeled “gluten-free” surged 44 percent between 2011 and 2013, reaching an estimated $10.5 billion. TGI Friday’s now offers an entire menu devoted to the category, complete with a burger served in a “gluten-sensitive bun.” Crave mac and cheese but avoiding gluten? Annie’s has you covered. Oreos? Boulder, Colorado-based Glutino offers a gluten-free knockoff (along with everything from breadcrumbs to Pop-Tart facsimiles).\n\nYet people have been growing, grinding, leavening, and baking wheat since the dawn of agriculture 10,000 years ago. It remains the globe’s most widely planted crop, serving as the main staple for a third of humanity. Is it really conceivable that it could have been slowly killing us all along?\n\nWheat Belly‘s author, cardiologist William Davis, claims that modern agricultural breeding has changed the nature of gluten, turning it toxic. He argues that wheat varieties developed in the 1960s and ’70s introduced a novel protein called gliadin that has led to all manner of chronic problems, including obesity and diabetes. Yet Davis’ claims have been roundly criticized by grain scientists. For that matter, there’s no scientific consensus on how prevalent gluten sensitivity is, what triggers it, or even if it exists at all.\n\nStephen Jones, a wheat breeder at Washington State University, suspects that we’ve been scapegoating the grain when we should be blaming the oven. Before I explain why, let me make clear that Jones is no apologist for Big Wheat. Back in 2003, the industry-dominated Washington Grain Commission threatened to stop funding his program after he refused to work with genetically modified varieties owned by the agrichemical giant BASF. He eschews conventional breeding—which he believes is all about generating bland strains tailored to the needs of corporate producers—for his own method, which prioritizes flavor.\n\nIn commercial bakeries, rising time has been winnowed from hours or even days down to mere minutes, thanks to fast-acting yeasts and additives.\n\nEven so, Jones doesn’t buy the notion that the modern breeding he shuns is causing bad reactions to bread. “It’s not wheat itself,” he says, pointing to a 2013 study by the US Department of Agriculture that found “no evidence” of increasing levels of gluten in wheat over the decades. Rather, Jones believes that the true problem with bread is how we make it. In commercial bakeries, rising time has been winnowed from hours or even days down to mere minutes, thanks to fast-acting yeasts and additives. By contrast, the team in Jones’ laboratory, located in a rural stretch along Puget Sound, lets dough rise for as long as 12 hours—and they’ve found that the longer it rises, the less potent the gluten that remains in the finished bread.\n\nWhat’s more, Jones points out, commercial bakers add a lot of extra gluten to their products. Read the label on any supermarket sliced bread—especially a whole-wheat one—and you’ll likely find “vital wheat gluten” among the top four ingredients. Because whole-wheat flour has a lower gluten density than white flour, industrial bakeries add extra gluten to make the bread more elastic, like white bread.\n\nAs whole-wheat bread has grown in popularity, so has vital wheat gluten use. US gluten imports—mostly from Australia, Canada, China, and Europe—more than doubled between 1997 and 2007, reaching 386 million pounds, and most of that went into baking. Donald Kasarda, a scientist with the USDA, estimates that our annual vital gluten intake per capita has tripled since 1977, from 0.3 pounds to 0.9 pounds—and Jones speculates that people who eat lots of commercially baked whole-wheat products may be getting more than their fair share.\n\nJones’ conjecture—that modern baking, not modern breeding, is responsible for the mysterious rise in gluten-related troubles—has not been proved correct. But then again, neither has any other explanation. Jones plans to continue his research, but in the meantime, with a test population of one, I conducted my own experiments with Jones’ method. I had drifted away from bread in recent years; it made me feel uncomfortably full. But when I made slow-fermented whole-wheat bread with a sourdough starter from Jones’ lab, I felt great—as I do when I eat loaves made by the increasing number of bakeries that use traditional methods and shun additives. No offense, but that sure beats the gluten-free menu.",

  "latent_22236": "Call of the Cthulhu: Dark Corners of the Earth took a long time to develop. When it was finally released, its insanity mechanic and physics engine were no longer novelties, its visuals looked dated, and its feeble gunplay and frustrating stealth left FPS fans largely dissatisfied. The adventuring elements stood out among the genre, though, and the game did a fantastic job of implementing the Mythos’ bestiary.\n\nThe Call of the Cthulhu setting is very much about the unimaginable terrors of the cosmos. Humankind is fairly insignificant against this backdrop, and the notable races and entities range tremendously in motives and capabilities. Although Dark Corners of the Earth has its fair share of grunt enemies, trying to distill all of the Mythos into common FPS foes with movement speeds, line-of-sight ranges, HP values, weapon weaknesses, etc., wouldn’t have been true to the source material.\n\nThankfully Headfirst Productions didn’t go that route, instead focusing on how to best implement the iconic monstrosities as they appeared in the original stories and Chaosium’s Pen & Paper campaigns. Here are my three favourite examples:\n\n1). Father Dagon\n\nOnce I sought out a celebrated ethnologist, and amused him with peculiar questions regarding the ancient Philistine legend of Dagon, the Fish-God.\n\nDuring a naval approach on the cultist stronghold, Deep Ones ambush the fleet. They pour onto the ships and many succumb to the brutal assault. Dark wizards further complicate matters by summoning gigantic waves that tilt the vessels nearly vertical; a handrail needs to be quickly grabbed in order to avoid certain death.\n\nEventually Father Dagon himself makes an appearance, bursting from the cold depths and latching onto the ship occupied by the protagonist. He shakes it up and down in an attempt to sink it, and periodically reemerges on different sides to swipe at the player. The only thing that can slow Dagon down is the ship’s massive cannon, and it takes a few point-blank shots to do so.\n\nThe first time I played the game, the protagonist decided he couldn’t handle fighting the ancient behemoth. By staring at Dagon for too long, I made Jack’s insanity meter go through the roof and he shot himself on the spot. It was quite shocking, and perfectly conveyed the dread and horror the Chtuhlhu monstrosities are meant to instill.\n\n2). Shoggoths\n\nIt was a terrible, indescribable thing vaster than any subway train—a shapeless congeries of protoplasmic bubbles, faintly self-luminous, and with myriads of temporary eyes forming and un-forming.\n\nThe Marsh family Refinery is filled with various dangers, but none more threatening than the Shoggoths. Roiling, pulsating masses of eyeballs and tentacles, the beasts serve more as an environmental threat and series of puzzles than a standalone enemy.\n\nWhen first encountered, the Shoggoths are summoned into giant vats via an electrical stimulus. This energy discharge can also be used to send them away, but their hideous, lashing tentacles make that a difficult task. If done successfully, the mass quickly spills out into a corridor following the protagonist. It fills it entirely at a frightening speed and can easily overwhelm if a bunch of doors aren’t bolted shut in time. Even that is only a temporary delay, and the Shoggoths soon burst through and drain away, leaving behind a corrosive trail.\n\nPerhaps the most terrifying sequence follows with the player crawling through a series of air ducts that begin to buckle and cave in. The Shoggoths throw themselves at the outside of the frail passageway in an attempt to crush anything inside. The final encounter involves a temporary respite through venting hot steam and flooding a room with explosive gas, but it never quite feels like a victory.\n\nWhat makes the Shoggoths so unnerving isn’t their absolute resistance to the player’s weapons, but rather their utter alienness. They’re tools used by the Marshes, but they can’t be understood or reasoned with, only prodded. It’s hard to tell where one Shoggoth ends and another begins, and their behaviour reflects this as well. At times they recklessly pounce on Jack, while at others they seem entirely disinterested, or even asleep. Battling the Shoggoths feels like a futile struggle against an overwhelming foe, but also an uncaring one.\n\n3). Flying Polyps\n\nThey were only partly material and had the power of aerial motion, despite the absence of wings. A monstrous plasticity and temporary lapses of visibility, whistling noises, and colossal footprints made up of five circular toe marks seemed also to be associated with them.\n\nThe Great Race of Yith (very well implemented in its own right) warns the player of the Flying Polyps via an eerie flashback. The sequence speaks of advanced energy weapons driving the polyps into underground chasms, but also foretells of their eventual uprising. The polyps are destined to break through their seals and wipe out the current iteration of the Yithians despite the race’s tremendous technological achievements.\n\nLate in the game, a tortured Deep One confesses to his kind’s fear of the tunnels below the city, but the player is forced to traverse them in order to reach Mother Hydra. Along the way an ancient weapon is discovered in a partly destroyed Yithian chamber, and soon after a cracked, basalt seal. As the protagonist drops in and makes his way across a precipitous drop, the screen begins to shake. A howling, seemingly localized tornado pushes through, and not one but two Flying Polyps emerge.\n\nThe tumorous mouths of the polyps gnash as they scream and blow, threatening to send Jack plummeting to his doom. During the whole fight they home in on the player — getting alarmingly close to the camera — which only accentuates the sense of danger and disgust. However, the Yithian weapon does affect them, wrapping their bodies in electric coils, but it takes quite a few shots before they slink down into the abyss. Even then it’s not so much a victory as plain survival, largely bestowed through the Great Race’s weaponry.",
  "latent_22293": "In October, NASCAR star Kasey Kahne will achieve a lifelong dream: fatherhood.\n\nKahne's girlfriend, Sam Sheets, is due to deliver a baby boy on Oct. 10.\n\n\"I've always really wanted a kid. Absolutely,\" Kahne said via speakerphone while dragging a sprint car-loaded trailer up the interstate toward Indianapolis. \"When I was growing up, I thought I'd have kids by the time I was 25. We're 10 years past that now, of course. But once we found out, I realized how badly I wanted kids.\n\n\"It's something that's been on my mind for a long time. I'm really excited to have this type of life-changing experience, and I can't wait to be the best dad I can possibly be.\"\n\nAs any parent will attest, parenthood presents a seismic life shift, and in myriad facets. Routine. Outlook. Perspective. The definition of \"rest.\"\n\nKahne said impending parenthood is the latest notable moment in a noticeable mid-30s maturation process.\n\n\"I'm really excited to have this type of life-changing experience, and I can't wait to be the best dad I can possibly be.\" Kasey Kahne\n\nHe is a consummate racer. Winning -- and determining how to win -- almost always occupies his thoughts. He owns sprint car teams, drives for an elite NASCAR Sprint Cup team and, at times, competes in the Xfinity and Truck series.\n\nIf those efforts aren't successful to his satisfaction, he incessantly ponders why.\n\nBut it doesn't negatively consume him like it once did. A bad finish on Sunday once meant a sour Monday. Sometimes it meant a sour Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday, too. He would stew until Friday, when he could climb back in the car and let the speed and the sound and the renewed focus course through him and remove the frustration.\n\nThese days, he has a new perspective: Let it sting a minute. Then let it go.\n\nNot just with racing, but with family, friends, Sam.\n\n\"We always shared a lot of the same interests but he didn't really talk about them, he was so shy and reserved,\" said Keith Rodden, Kahne's crew chief. \"He was always really careful about choosing friends, and the people that were around him. He's probably still like that a little bit, but he seems more outgoing now.\n\n\"That's part of his maturation. He also has more camaraderie with the team guys now. He gets to know them. He's definitely matured a lot socially, getting to know new people and letting them into his circle sooner.\"\n\nAge will do that to a man.\n\n\"I feel more open to not being perfect,\" Kahne said. \"I'm doing a lot of the same things I'd always do. Age has given me a different perception on life.\n\n\"I'm really happy right now. I'm really content with where I am. The only things that still get me mad are racing-related.\"\n\nWinning still matters as much as it ever did. But failure doesn't matter as much. Rodden said Kahne is still too hard on himself.\n\n\"Oh, way too hard,\" Rodden said with a laugh. \"Sometimes things just don't go your way. There's no reason to be real hard on yourself. He's still learning that.\"\n\nLike father, like son\n\nKasey said he won't push his own son to be a racer. But if son dreams to race like father, then father will do everything he can to help.\n\nIt's a lesson Kasey learned from his parents, Kelly and Tammy Kahne, who exposed him to other sports and interests before he committed fully to motorsports.\n\n\"One of the coolest things I remember with my parents, is they always wanted me to play sports,\" Kahne said. \"That was big to them, me playing baseball and basketball. And they pulled me from racing, in a way.\"\n\nKasey Kahne's father Kelly, right, wanted his son to be sure racing was what he truly wanted before committing to it full-time. Darrell Ingham/Getty Images\n\nWhen Kahne's competitive focus did shift fully toward racing, at age 14, Kelly still wasn't convinced it was the right decision.\n\n\"Kasey was always super-focused on racing,\" Kelly said. \"But at that age we didn't know if that's really what he wanted ... We wanted to make sure he wasn't doing it for any other reason than because he loved it. As a dad, I didn't want him in a race car risking anything unless it's exactly what he wanted it to be.\n\n\"I had other race car drivers drive my cars before Kasey, and I was always concerned about their safety. But when it's your own son it's different. It's a lot harder and a lot more gratifying -- a lot more extreme in every part of it.\"\n\nReady for new role\n\nKahne is the latest in a string of NASCAR first-time fathers over the past several years that includes, most recently, 2012 Cup champion Brad Keselowski and 29-time Cup race winner Kyle Busch, both of whom became dads in late May.\n\n\"He'll be an awesome dad,\" said Rodden, who returned to Kahne's team as crew chief this year after a year away from the team as Jamie McMurray's crew chief.\n\n\"He loves children and he's so good with them. That's one thing that was odd last year, not being on his team. He made such an impression on [Rodden's daughter] Emmy, that any time she was at the track she wanted to go see Mr. Kasey. As shy as he is, he's so great with the kids. And I doubt anybody outside the industry even knows that.\"\n\nKahne began preparing years ago, as evidenced by his 40-acre property in rural North Carolina. His home rests there, as do adjacent homes for his sister and brother and their families.\n\nThe idea was to grow up and grow old together.\n\n\"It speaks volumes about where his heart is and his thought process about life,\" Kelly Kahne said. \"He really understands and appreciates what family means. Sure, there's been times when feathers were ruffled, but we all come back to what's most important, and for us that's to stay tight as a family.\"\n\nKahne's sister, Shanon Adams, echoes her father's sentiments.\n\n\"Family has always been Kasey's priority,\" Adams said. \"To be able to have the kids grow up together and be really close cousins, and for me and Kale and Kasey to be close enough to be neighbors, and walk to each other's homes for dinner, is something we're so grateful for.\"\n\nKahne loves the thought that his son will grow up alongside his family, playing with his cousins.\n\n\"That was my No. 1 thought going into it, and it's fun to see it actually coming together that way,\" he said. \"It's what I dreamed for.\"\n\nAdams said Kahne has long been the cool uncle. Adams has three children, 7-year old Eli -- who two months ago began his racing career -- and 4-year-old twin daughters. Kahne's brother, Kale, has a 7-month-old daughter.\n\n\"He's a really great uncle, really into the kids,\" Adams said. \"He lights up when they're around, and they're always so excited to see him. They're constantly asking to go hang out with uncle Kasey.\"\n\nDialing down the pressure\n\nKahne, by nature, is a very private man. He was uneasy about how to announce that he would soon become a father. Just because he's a NASCAR driver doesn't mean there should be added pressure, he figured.\n\nHe has enough pressure as it is. His is a performance-based job, especially considering he's employed by the most dominant force in the industry. In his first three seasons at Hendrick Motorsports, Kahne logged five wins and four poles, including a single victory and no poles in 2014.\n\nBut in November, the pressure was relieved somewhat when Kahne signed a three-year contract extension to drive the No. 5 Chevrolet through the 2018 season.\n\nIn addition to being Kasey Kahne's crew chief, Keith Rodden is also a close friend in whom he regularly confides. Doug Pensinger/Getty Images\n\n\"I've always raced knowing I need to perform to stay here, and when I re-did the deal with Hendrick it was a really big deal for me, personally,\" he said. \"I felt it meant Rick [Hendrick] really wanted me to be there, and that the team, the guys, and everything we'd worked on and we'd built around the last three years, that I'd be a part of that. It definitely took some pressure off of me.\n\n\"Hendrick is just the best place. The way they treat you, the way you work together to find speed and the teammates I have, how it all flows. It's perfect for me right now.\"\n\nIn an attempt to improve Kahne's performance, Hendrick replaced Kahne's crew chief of the past 10 seasons, Kenny Francis, with Rodden. The decision was difficult for Kahne, given the friendship and success he and Francis achieved.\n\nBut Rodden is a disciple of Francis, and one of Kahne's closest friends. They go to dinner weekly to chat race cars and family, and Rodden says Kahne's commentary is more open and more vulnerable.\n\nIn fact, Rodden was among the first people with whom Kahne shared the news that he would soon be a dad.\n\n\"I kept him up-to-date on it the entire time. He's a good friend, and he works super hard and he's really smart. That's a big deal, and once we get rolling and get our wins, it's all going to pay off,\" Kahne said.\n\n\"I still feel like I look at things and think about things in a similar way to how I have for a while. But I do feel like I've matured a lot, and I understand how many different ways there are to do anything you want to do. There's not just one way. And I feel like I'm way more open and relaxed and mature to life, what it throws at you, racing, family, friends, whatever.\"",

Unlike in years past, the 2017 edition of this annual Ford event did not highlight a specific vehicle theme.\n\nDave Glickman, the show’s chairman, said that despite this year’s show not having an overall theme – it was more of a test-run of the new venue than anything – he’d liken it to not just having entertainment value, but educational value. For him, it’s all about being able to appreciate automotive heritage, and learn from it, is part of the show’s purpose.\n\n“You’ll notice we don’t just have Ford vehicles at this show – we have trucks and cars from manufacturers all over the world,” Glickman said. “Truth be told, a lot of what we call ‘new’ ideas are not really new – many have been done before. Our planners, engineers, stylists and management want to see what’s been out there before. During my day job, I involve myself a lot with patent work and I myself have patents in production inspired from some of these old designs.”\n\nNearly 400 vehicles were on display on the lawn along Rotunda Drive on the Ford campus, among them some 40 or more Ford Pintos of all vintages and types who arrived at the show with a police escort as part of a weeklong “Pinto Stampede – Return to Dearborn” event.

  "latent_22541": "Four days ago this post appeared on Kenyan company Mocality’s website accusing Google of not only scraping mocality’s database, which is basically the most valuable part of their business, but also calling up the numbers in the scraped database to upsell them a Google site. Even worse, the Google employees claimed that Mocality was under or working with Google. This is certainly unethical, and may very well be illegal – Mocality is getting ready to sue. Mocality uncovered that this seemed to be an international operation involving Google headquarters and call centers in India.\n\nThe plot was unveiled in a rather clever way by Mocality, and the technical breakdown of how they caught Google with their pants down lent the blogpost a lot of credibility.\n\nAfter a few hours it was confirmed that Google was involved with this statement from Nelson Mattos of Google: “We were mortified to learn that a team of people working on a Google project improperly used Mocality’s data and misrepresented our relationship with Mocality to encourage customers to create new websites. We’ve already unreservedly apologised to Mocality. We’re still investigating exactly how this happened, and as soon as we have all the facts, we’ll be taking the appropriate action with the people involved.”\n\nThe story quickly spread and both the original blogpost and the reply from Mattos was top news on sites such as Hacker news, Reddit and Boing boing. It even made it as far as The economist. This is a big deal. Especially because this behaviour stands in stark contrast to Googles ethos of Don’t be evil.\n\nYet now, four days later, that’s all we know. We don’t even know whether the above is an official statement from Google since Nelson Mattos presumably posted this from his personal Google+ account.\n\nThis tells me a few things:\n\nGoogle is not entirely in control of all of their operations. If this scandal was contained to Kenya maybe it could be written off as a few fraudulent employees or a local manager that went a bit too far to get his bonus, but since it appears that it extends to both India and Googles headquarters in Mountain view there’s someone at a fairly high level that doesn’t have full control of his domain. Google doesn’t handle PR well. Writing, blogposts about new features, April fools jokes and descriptions of how great the food at Google is is the easy part. It’s when you have a scandal on your hands that your PR needs to shine. Where’s the damage control? Where’s the communication? We don’t even know if Mattos statement is official. It’s been four days! Google is becoming a big company, just like so many other big companies. They don’t know what is going on in all divisions, they’re spreading their portfolio thin (A Kenyan online directory for instance…), and they’re losing their original values because of it. Don’t be evil is not a mantra for Google anymore, it’s become a stale mission statement. Just like the stale mission statements all other big companies have.\n\nWhen are we going to get an official excuse and explanation? Are we even going to get one?",
  "latent_22654": "The Immutability of Math and How Almost Everything Else Will Pass\n\nThis article was originally published on Forbes\n\nTL;DR: Right now, there’s a cultural push to untie the historical link between advanced math and programming that could partially deter engineers from entering the field. But those who have a strong foundation in math will have the best jobs of the future. Let’s stop separating math from programming for short-term relief and, instead, focus on fundamental, unchanging truths with which we’ll engineer the future.\n\nIf you dig deep into today’s discourse on the role of mathematics in programming, you’ll find a sharp, double-edged sword.On the one hand, people often say that because the number of app development tools are growing, you don’t necessarily need to be great at math to write software today. Amidst a widespread shortage of traditional programming talent, numerous opinion pieces video interviews with educators and forum questions point to answers that are positioned to ease the apprehension of people exploring the field. And it’s true. Chances are, the average software engineer is not going to need Calculus while coding apps in Ruby on Rails. If you look at any given job requirement, you’d be hard pressed to find probability or number theory next to Java or C++ skills.Since computer science is a nascent field that sprouted out of mathematic departments, there’s a cultural push to untie the historical link between advanced math and programming that could partially deter engineers from entering the field. For instance, there are literally half a dozen recent articles titled with something like: 6 ). Downplaying the importance of mathematical knowledge in software development aims to help make the field less intimidating for entry-level programmers.\n\nBut is downplaying the importance of math a sustainable message for future generations of engineers?\n\nOn the other hand, software development is quickly shapeshifting. If you discount mathematics, and in turn focus on learning transitory programming tools, you’ll be left without the skills necessary to adapt to emerging computer science concepts that have already started infiltrating engineering teams today. Without expanding mathematical knowledge, these software engineers are going to risk being left out of the most exciting, creative engineering jobs of the rapidly approaching future.\n\nMath is a Veiled Pillar\n\nThe reality is that even though most programmers today don’t need to know advanced mathematics to be good software developers, math is still a fundamental pillar of both computer science and software development. Programming is just one tool in a computer scientist’s toolkit—a means to an end. It’s hard to draw definitive lines between disciplines, but here’s an attempt at an eagle-eye view of computer science as a field to build a bigger picture:\n\nAt its core, computers are centered on the mathematical concept of logic. Fundamental math that you learn in high school or middle school, like linear algebra, boolean logic, graph theory, inevitably shows up in daily programming. Here are 10 examples of times when you might need mathematics in real-world programming today:\n\nNumber theory. If you’re ever asked how one algorithm or data structure performs over another, you’ll need a solid grasp of number theory to make that analysis. Graphing. If you’re programming for user interface, basic geometry, like graphing, is an essential skill. Geometry. If you’re creating a mobile app and you need to create custom bounce animations that are modeled on springs, you’ll need geometry skills. Basic Algebra. If your boss asks you: How much user retention can we expect to grow next month if we increase the performance of our backend by 20%? This is a pure variable equation. Single Variable Calculus. These days FinTech firms like Jane Street are among the most sought-after companies for programmers because they pay well and have interesting challenges. You need to be able to analyze financial parameters to make crucial predictions to get these coveted jobs. Statistics. If you’re working at a startup and you need to A/B test different elements on a website, you might be tapped to understand normal distribution, confidence intervals, variation and standard deviation to see how well your code change is performing. Linear Algebra. Anytime you have image processing problems, recommendation engines (like Google’s PageRank or Netflix’s recommendation list), you need linear algebra skills. Probability. When you’re debugging or testing, you’ll need a solid understanding of probability to make randomized sequences reproducible. Big-O. If your company’s expanding to a brand new region, and you don’t understand the implications of a O(N^2) sorting algorithm, you could be pinged at odd hours because the expansion introduced holes in the algorithm. Optimization. Generally, anytime you need to make something run faster or perform better, you should be able to know how to get the minimum and maximum value of a function.\n\nWe’re far beyond the point of needing engineers to code simple solutions. Engineering teams at enterprises and—especially—startups have to earn the leading edge. They rely\n\non engineering and product teams to gain competitive advantage by investing in emerging concepts like Big Data manipulation, handle high-scale systems and predictive modeling. And they all require a solid framework of mathematics.\n\nIt’s not uncommon to hear refutations like: I’ve been a software engineer for 15 years and never used advanced mathematics on the job. But are we all really still going to be coding web and mobile apps 10 years from now?\n\nThose Who Incrementally Exercise Mathematics Skills Will Get the Coolest Jobs\n\nIn the beginning of this piece, we considered why many educators and experts might be downplaying the importance of math in daily programming to encourage more engineers to enter the field. In order to meet the demand for engineering talent in the next 5 to 10 years, it’s clear that we need to take steps to encourage more peopleof diverse backgrounds to join the field. The BLS reportsthat computing and mathematics will make up more than half of the projected growth of annual STEM job openings between 2010 – 2020.\n\nBut this message of “you don’t have to be good at math to program” is actually fueling a self-destructive myth that’s baked into our culture today, which is: Math skills can’t be acquired: You’re either born with it or you’re not. This myth persists for at least two reasons:\n\nOne, Professors Miles Kimball and assistant professor Noah Smith have taught math for many years and say: “people’s belief that math ability can’t change becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.” Consistently saying that you’re “not a math person” means you won’t be a math person.\n\nTwo, people perceive mathematical fields as dry and uncreative. It goes back to the oversimplification of the dichotomy between the “left brain” humanities and “right brain” STEM subjects. People who want to be more creative have more reasons to distance themselves from math.\n\nA better way to attract more people to the field is by talking about the interesting, creative jobs that are taking over the future of software development.\n\nIn the next 10 years, software engineers aren’t still going to be limited to programming web and mobile apps. They’ll be working on writing mainstream computer vision and virtual reality apps, working with interesting cryptographic algorithms for security and building amazing self-learning products using machine learning. You can’t go very far in any of these fields without a solid mathematical foundation.\n\nAs the field of computer science is expanding, companies are going to be able to take advantage of more complex math to build software technology. Dr. Ann Irvine, principal data scientist at security software companyRedOwl, always looks for strong intuition on how to work with large datasets. And math happens to be inherently tied to this skill.\n\n“It’s largely enabled by the fact that lots of modern computer algorithms, especially in machine learning, take advantage of very large data sets, so that enables the use of more complex mathematical models.” – Principal Data Scientist Ann Irvine, PhD\n\nAs it stands today, you don’t need much beyond basic algebra and geometry for software development in general. But software development of the future will be made up of highly specialized subfields of CS. Here’s a chart that illustrates just how fast these futuristic technologies are shifting toward the mainstream consumer market. The first row talks about the market opportunity in the next 4 years, the second row highlights the adoption rate and the final row is an indication of the job demand today:\n\nFocus on the Fundamentals Because Technology Will Pass Anyway\n\n“The most valuable acquisitions in a scientific or technical education are the general-purpose mental tools which remain serviceable for a lifetime.” – George Forsythe, the founder of Stanford’s computer science engineering department.\n\nIt’s far more empowering to talk about the importance of skills that serve you for a lifetime rather than the demand for short-term tools today. Math is an unshakeable force in programming. The core concept of breaking down problems, abstractions and finding solutions using formal formulas will never change.\n\nIn fact, academia is susceptible to a massive, inherent failure in being able to keep up with the ever changing tools that industries demand. Hisham H. Muhammad is a computer science PhD and illustrates the argument perfectly in this Tweet below. It’s interesting to contrast the years in which Hisham studied computer science between 1994-2000 with the years at which the technologies mentioned started taking off:\n\nI felt like saying this. pic.twitter.com/mHJ1rENoX1 — Hisham (@hisham_hm) December 13, 2015\n\nThere’s such an emphasis on branches of programming language and tools today that it’s easy to miss the bigger forrest. It’s better to start practicing now while there’s no significant pressure to apply advanced concepts to your work…yet. Even if it’s by solving one mathematical problem a day, you’ll be so much better equipped with tools to solve much more interesting problems down the line. Let’s stop separating math from programming for short-term relief and, instead, focus on fundamental, unchanging truths with which we’ll engineer the future.\n\nResources to Help Boost Confidence in Math:\n\nForget what you learned in school (memorizing theorems or trig identities won’t help you). Instead, learn to recognize problems and choose the right formula.\n\nRead great books: Art of Problem So l ving Mathematics for Computer Science ( free eBook ) Godel Escher Bach ( free eBook )",
  "latent_22872": "AUSTIN, Texas — Google will begin flying tethered wind turbines next month that can continuously generate 600 kilowatts of power.\n\nDuring a keynote address at South by Southwest (SXSW) here today, Google X head Astro Teller said that the flying power generators can produce that power with just one percent of the energy cost of huge wind turbines built on towers.\n\n“The physics of why [it’s] exciting,” Teller said, “is that the big opportunity with the wind, on balance, is that the higher the wind speed is, and the more consistent the wind is,” the higher the power generated.\n\n“That’s juicier than it sounds,” he added. “The power of wind goes up at [the] cube of the speed. If you double the speed, you get eight times the power. There’s an enormous incentive to go up higher.”\n\nFor some time, Google X has been testing 28-foot-long prototypes of the flying turbines, but will now begin flying 84-foot-long versions.\n\nTeller explained that the turbines sit on a perch. They look like the wings of a plane, with no fuselage, tethered in such a way that as they soar, they pull the propellers.",
  "latent_22915": "What divides us By Alisa Craddock\n\nweb posted November 16, 2009 A few days ago, someone said to me that Pres. Obama doesn't know what he's doing. \"He doesn't know how to be our president,\" she said to me. What this lady (and much of America) doesn't understand is, that isn't his job. Oh, that's what we elected him to do. That's his title—President of the United States—but that's not what he is there for. Those who chose and groomed him, who have bankrolled his rocket ride to the White House, have a different job for him, and in that he knows exactly what he is doing. Obama's job is to prepare America to become part of the global government, to cut us down to size, to cripple us, humiliate us, socially destroy us, so that we will need, as a nation, to become part of the global nanny state. He is to shore up the power of his coalition by filling it with those who share his objective (such as transferring authority and power from Congress to his czars, and by eliminating those in civil service who are not on board with the agenda). He is to seize power over businesses and extort the business world to comply with this agenda, or face destruction by the government. He is to create laws that will bring the American people under absolute subjection, so that their compliance can be assured. And he is to disarm us. And this agenda has been laid out for decades. Since the early 1960's, the final phase of this agenda has been in motion. In addition, our foreign policy shifted from one of helping less developed countries to develop their people and resources, to become productive and self-sustaining, to one of exploitation: Our wealthiest elite have set sights on their natural resources, and population control is the means to prevent the depletion of those resources. It is not only the US, of course, but the wealthy elite of the world, who are complicit in this goal. But by promoting a \"myth\" of overpopulation, and an \"environmental\" crisis, they have succeeded in getting much of the world (including many in the U.S.) to go along with it, believing it is necessary to save the planet. Once upon a time, the US had a conscience. The people opposed contraception, and certainly abortion. At the very least they believed these were private issues, not the government's business. President Kennedy has opposed the use of government funds for what is euphemistically called \"family planning\" precisely because it would make it look as though the government was trying to control the population of black, Hispanic and Asian people. (In point of fact, that is precisely what the goal is. It is right out of Margaret Sanger's stated objectives.) After Kennedy's assassination, as reported in the EIR Special Report, The Genocidal Roots of Bush's New World Order, American policy shifted to a disasterous \"post-industrial policy, an absurd idea, abandoning the formula that had made America a superpower. America's foreign policy changed from one of assisting LDC's (less-developed countries) to develop and become self-sustaining, to one responding to the new ideology of \"limits to growth\". (I want to jump in here and point out that George Bush Sr.'s name is in the title because of his public invocation of the term \"New World Order\", but the agenda that is described herein is not a \"Republican\" agenda, nor a \"Democrat\" agenda. The wealthy elite propelling this agenda are on both sides of the aisle.) It was Jimmy Carter (Democrat) who signed the Global 2000 report, and it was Henry Kissinger (Republican) who penned the National Security Study Memorandum 200, (NSSM 200) also known as the Kissinger Report, both of which laid the groundwork for this transition and the new agenda. Controlling population has become an ugly obsession that has spawned all sorts of perverse and twisted social objectives. The so-called \"Population Bomb\" was touted as a threat to our very survival. We had to bring our rate of population growth to zero (or less) or we were doomed, according to the propaganda, because there weren't enough resources left to provide for all of us. Hand in hand with the zero population agenda was the agenda to end all economic progress. Now this is key: One of the most influential figures promoting stringent population control measures, Paul Ehrlich (author of The Population Bomb), also urged that, in order to restore a \"quality environment\" in North America, the U.S. must be \"de-developed\"—that is, \"bringing our economic system (especially patterns of consumption) into line with the realities of ecology and the world resource situation.\" (Does this sound a bit like \"Cap and Trade\"?) Who else can you think of who is in favor of de-development. Does the name John Holdren (Obama's science czar, and another fierce population control advocate) ring a bell?\n\nEhrlich goes on to say that \"This campaign (for de-development) would be largely political, especially with regard to our overexploitation of world resources, but the campaign should be strongly supplemented by legal and boycott actions against polluters and others whose activities damage the environment.\" The de-development strategy also, of course, funneled money into minority neighborhoods for \"family planning\" clinics where this \"social service\" as the family planning clinics would like you to believe, included forced sterilizations. America became the chief exporter of population control programs, and, as advised in the NSSM 200 report, tied economic aid to a country's willingness to accept population control programs that included contraception, abortion, and sterilization. It is reprehensible how many poor women were baited with a few dollars to have their tubes tied. It is reprehensible that people in need of aid, especially in a natural disaster, are faced with the agonizing choice of sacrificing their moral convictions for much needed emergency aid, or holding fast to them, and suffering disease, starvation, and death as a godless world turns its cold back on them. Here at home, the Roe v. Wade decision has resulted now in some 50 million abortion deaths. In some other countries, the percentages are much higher, with, in some cases, 30-50% of all pregnancies resulting in abortion. In Europe, Japan, Russia, Thailand, and here in the US, along with a significant number of other countries, we are beginning to see the poisonous fruit of the culture of death they have created with their propaganda as they now face the prospect of demographic suicide in those countries. How do you suppose our leaders will deal with the imbalance of young to old people in this country? Well, in 1987, the director of the population think tank called the Hastings Institute, Daniel Callahan, suggested, in a book called Setting Limits, that the government must aggressively promote euthanasia and the \"right to die\". As the EIR report described it, he claimed that human beings have a natural lifespan of approximately 75 years, and that the government should not spend one penny on any life-extending medical treatment for people over that age. As EIR reports, \"Callahan justified his homicidal mania on two grounds: the \"philosophical\" grounds that man should be content with dying at the age of 75 or so, and the other, that the growing disproportion of elderly to young people in the United States necessitated draconian cutbacks in medical treatment of the aging!...In other words…the aborting of [50 million] potential young Americans over the last [36 years] has led to a situation in which it became \"necessary\" to kill off the elderly!\" (EIR Special Report, page 9). Remember, this report was written in 1992, 17 years ago. Thus, we have the drive to ram through a health care bill that will ration health care to the elderly. Since it is financially unsustainable, any promises they make about not rationing will be empty. There are already bureaucrats in place (appointees of this administration, and paid for by Stimulus money) who are rationing our health care. Medicare is already way beyond any private insurance company with respect to what sort of treatments they deny payment for. Cut $500 billion from the funds available to pay for geriatric healthcare, and you have a situation where people will be receiving far less treatment than they did before. It is easy for us to fall into the trap of believing that overpopulation is the problem, and population control the answer. The world is in turmoil. It feels like it's about to explode. We are inundated with gangs and murderous atrocities, we've seen a horrendous increase in unwed pregnancies, children growing up without proper guidance, raised in the tender mercies of the nanny state, most ending up in trouble with the law. Our relations with other countries are strained with starving people in third world countries, genocide, war, terrorism. But is population the problem? No. It is government policies that have created this situation, both at home and abroad. Contraception and Roe v. Wade created the out of wedlock pregnancy problem in America, which caused the crime problem and the 9 trillion dollar welfare problem. (Contraception and abortion provide the delusion of risk-free sex, which leads to risky behavior, which leads to more pregnancies. But the reality of pregnancy and the abhorrence for abortion most women feel when actually faced with the decision, and society's destigmatization of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, have given rise to an increase in children born out of wedlock.) Since most of these kids will grow up without a father, and consequently in poverty, most will get into unlawful activity. Illegal immigration has caused a significant increase in violent crime, in addition. The government, of course, knows all this. They have the Moynihan report, among others, to point it out to them. But our government seems to want to foment social discord, perhaps as an antidote to charity, which would enhance civil society, rather than de-develop it. But the government seems also to have a vested interest in encouraging sexual activity out of wedlock: it is the most powerful weapon against Christianity, which teaches chastity and family values. Would it surprise us to learn that at a recent meeting between a number of population control NGO's (in which pro-life participation was shut out), the issue of the obstacle that religion (read Catholic religion) played in resisting the population control measures came up. The question arose of how they might combat the influence of religion. The response was to encourage young people to become sexually active. This is done through sex ed courses, and a generous provision of birth control measures. Once young people engage in sexual activity, their consciences are scorched, and often religious values are abandoned. So you see, our government here at home knows that teaching abstinence actually does discourage premarital sex, but that would interfere with the anti-life, anti-family, pro-environmentalist attitude they wish to instill. Otherwise the young people might actually recognize that the healthcare bill, and the Cap and Trade legislation are both aimed at the same goal: Absolute control over you and all other resources. In essence, they want us all to churn their butter, while they lap up the cream. The Population Bomb is a myth. The Population Research Institute, The Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute*, Human Life International, all concur that \"overpopulation\" is a myth devised by global elites to keep for themselves and their use, the natural and mineral resources of the world. So what is the answer. Christians know. We need to stop killing our children. We need to restore a culture of life. We need to help those in need, not kill them off. Abstinence education, and natural family planning will help encourage healthy families without sacrificing human dignity and morality. Education can create useful citizens instead of \"useless eaters\" as they are called. America can lead the way, if her people wake up and recognize that this evil has grown out of a lie, an insidious anti-life agenda which, by propaganda, became internalized in the collective conscience of our nation. It has to end. Abortion must end. Assisted suicide (which will inevitably give rise to euthanasia) must end. We must stop it here, and we must stop promoting it abroad. It is a gross violation of the rights and dignity of human beings. It is a denial of God. It is a rejection of charity in the most brutal, evil way possible. There can be no excuse for it. Our political leaders in both parties have countenanced this obscene agenda. The division in this country is not between the Republican Party and the Democrat Party. The division within the Republican Party is not between \"right wing extremists\" and more sane, sensible centrists. The division is between those who support the global government, and all its evil designs, and the ones who respect our own Constitution, and, yes, who recognize and embrace our Christian moral law as the foundation upon which this country's laws arose. The Republican Party needs to recognize that we (the people) cannot compromise on the moral principles of our tradition and history. We cannot survive as a nation, as a people, if we accept that compromise. Our present circumstances prove that. So as Conservatives, we will not vote for you anymore. We won't take the lesser of two evils anymore. We will vote for the guy that says America is a sovereign, Christian nation, and who will take an oath to defend her and mean it. And we'll vote for the guy who will reinstall, if you will, her original operating system, and be very careful what sort of software s/he uploads, careful to quarantine and eliminate whatever viruses may be embedded in that software. Our new leaders will be men and women who will restore Truth, Justice, and the American Way. We'll have American Heritage Programs at school again. We'll have a Christmas pageant. We'll remember our honored dead and our wounded living, and we'll fight the right battles for the defense of our country. We'll honor our elderly, we'll teach our youth right from wrong, good from evil. We'll not just be a proud nation, but a good nation again. But only if we repent of this evil we have done, and turn back to the Living God, who is all forgiving to those who fear Him. \"Without Me, you can do nothing,\" the Lord says. Well, certainly without Him, we can do nothing good. So what will we choose? Evil? Death? Exploitation? Slavery? Or will we choose Truth, virtue, life and liberty? This is our nation's moment of truth. Do we perish as a nation, or will we be \"born again.\" Those words have never been more poignant in our history. Therefore, choose life, not just for yourself, but for all those who will come after. We must stand our ground without wavering. If not, we will perish.

Maggie Nichols, Twin City Twisters, 117.900\n\nWatching Nichols on beam, I thought “how did this girl go from good to fantastic between Italy/Japan and this summer!?” She always reminds me of Aly Raisman in 2010, except now I think she’s way better than Raisman was back then. She competed a lovely front aerial to sissone to split jump, a solid bhs loso, a switch rung, and a double pike dismount for a solid 14.75.\n\nOn floor, she nailed both her double layout and piked full-in to start. Both were landed well, though the full-in did have some issues with leg form. She also wasn’t entirely clean in her 1.5 through to double back but again landed it well, and she nearly stuck her double pike to finish for a 14.45.\n\nShe hit one of her best DTYs ever on vault, looking clean in the air until just before her landing and nearly sticking it despite doing it a little over to the right for a 15.1.\n\nOn bars, she started out nicely with a toe full Maloney and straddle Jaeger. Her Church was good but she connected to a closely-caught pak salto which she had to muscle into before the toe on, though she did it expertly. A mistake like that could have caused most people to come off the bars. She is laser-focused, however, and hit her van Leeuwen and awesome double layout to finish with a 14.95.\n\nHer all-around total for the day was a huge 59.25.\n\n4. Alyssa Baumann, WOGA, 116.100\n\nBeginning on beam, Baumann nailed her standing arabian to applause. The rest of her routine was gorgeous, as she continued with a switch ring, bhs loso, front aerial to split jump, Onodi, sissone to straddle jump, and a 2.5 with a hop forward for a 15.15.\n\nOn floor she hit a great double layout with just a hop before sticking her double tuck cold. She had her usual helicopter legs on her slightly underrotated triple full, and took a step back on her double pike for a 14.45.\n\nShe vaulted a mostly clean DTY, just losing form a bit towards the end and landing a little deep for a 14.9.\n\nUnfortunately, she began her bars routine with a fall on her toe full to Maloney. She hit it the second time, following it with a messy pak salto, messy van Leeuwen, huge straddle Jaeger, and a half-in half-out dismount for her 13.2.\n\nHer all-around score for the second day is a 57.7.\n\n5. Mykayla Skinner, Desert Lights, 115.450\n\nSkinner’s floor routine was one of her best outings. She still showed some form issues in her layout double double, but hit it within the boundaries before hitting her double double (hopped back), her full-in, hopped forward), and her 1.5 through to 2.5 for a 15.1 with a 6.6 difficulty score.\n\nOn vault, she competed the Cheng to earn a 15.4. It was much better than we saw in practice today, but she whipped her hand up really fast on the block and was slightly piked as she landed. Her second vault was a powerful and clean DTY, though maybe a bit too powerful because she hopped back about two feet on the landing for a 15.1. I mean, she trains the Amanar, so she’s used to coming on with a lot more power!\n\nSkinner had the best uneven bar I think she’s ever done, looking messy on some skills but performing well overall to earn a 13.2. She hit her van Leeuwen with leg separation, a toe full to huge Tkatchev, a Ray, a really clean bail, and a near-stuck full-in. Her execution seemed a bit low – especially since this routine was a million percent better than her day one routine and the execution difference was only a couple of tenths.\n\nOn beam, Skinner hit a bhs to tuck full, switch to switch half to back tuck, side aerial to sissone, full L turn, and double tuck dismount with a hop for a 14.2.\n\nHer all-around score today was a 57.9.\n\n6. Amelia Hundley, Cincinnati, 112.200\n\nHundley started her night with a great beam routine, nailing her wolf hop to front aerial to sissone, her switch side half, her punch front to split jump, and her double tuck dismount for a 14.1. It was a very nice routine for her, showing a lot of control.\n\nOn floor, Hundley stuck her double layout and nailed her 2.5 to punch front layout. Her double pike was a bit underrotated, but her double tuck looked much better than in night one, just slightly rebounding it back. She earned a 14.0.\n\nHundley vaulted an FTY, though according to the vault board, was supposed to do a DTY so something must have gone wrong; she hit with a hop for a 13.9.\n\nOn bars, she earned a nice 14.5 for a routine that included a toe full to Maloney, big Jaeger, Ricna, pak salto, and a hit dismount.\n\nHer all-around score for the day was a 56.5.\n\n7. Madison Desch, GAGE, 111.200\n\nThis was one of Desch’s better beam routines to start out the night, as she nailed her bhs bhs layout to start. Her punch front tuck was solid, as were her front aerial, side somi, and switch half. She took a step forward on her double tuck dismount for a 14.2 score.\n\nOn floor, Desch competed a double arabian hopped out of bounds for her first pass. Her second was a nice 1.5 to Rudi, followed by a double pike and a messy triple with her foot landing out of bounds. The lack of attention to landings brought 0.6 in neutral deductions, giving her a 13.55 on what could have been a 14+ score with landings inside.\n\nShe vaulted a DTY, and though her block was a bit low after coming on to the table a bit too high, she landed it – albeit a deep and messy landing – for a 14.5.\n\nOn bars, she had a messy routine with mistakes in her handstands on the high bar though she covered up well for the most part. She did an inbar, stalder full, Chow to clean pak salto, Chow half, stalder half, piked Jaeger, and a low full-in that gave Al Fong a nervous breakdown. Her score was a 12.95.\n\nHer all-around score for today was a 55.2.\n\n8. Macy Toronjo, Texas Dreams, 109.150\n\nOn floor, Toronjo showed a captivating routine with a full-twisting double tuck, 1.5 through to double full, double pike into a lunge, and a double tuck. It was a great routine, earning a 13.95. She is so beautiful to watch…I can’t wait to see her with some Miss Val choreography when she gets to UCLA.\n\nToronjo vaulted a gorgeous FTY, not getting much height or distance but looking perfectly straight throughout and landing right on the line to earn a 13.75.\n\nShe hit her bar routine, competing an Endo half, Maloney, Tkatchev, stalder, clean bail, and a double layout dismount hopped forward for a 12.95.\n\nOn beam, Toronjo earned a 13.7 for a routine that included a punch front tuck and double full dismount.\n\nHer all-around score for the day was a 54.35.\n\n9. Felicia Hano, Gym-Max, 84.750\n\nFloor was an excellent outing for Hano, who had the smoothest double layout I’ve ever seen from her. She also nailed her double pike, a near-stuck double full, and a double tuck for a 13.75.\n\nShe stuck her DTY on vault with mostly clean form; her legs coming apart as she landed was the only issue and it wasn’t as big as we’ve seen…but it was fantastic and earned a 14.9.\n\nOn beam, she finished nicely with a 14.2 on a routine that included a punch front tuck, bhs loso, and double pike with a step for a 14.2.\n\n10. Madison Kocian, WOGA, 60.000\n\nKocian began her night with a lovely beam routine, earning a 14.55 for her effort. She had a lovely standing arabian and switch ring, had a check between her front aerial and sheep jump, hit her bhs loso and side aerial, and then stumbled back her double pike dismount landing.\n\nOn bars, Kocian competed a Chow, a pak salto with messy legs to a Chow half, an inbar half to huge straddle Jaeger, and a near-stuck full-in dismount for a huge 15.5.\n\n11. Ashton Locklear, Everest, 59.100\n\nOn beam, Locklear started out with a fall on her opening side aerial to layout stepout series, a combination she struggled with earlier this week as well. She came back nicely to hit her punch front tuck, full L turn, side somi, switch to switch half, and a high double tuck dismount with a step. She was awarded a 13.55 for her effort.\n\nBars were great, though not her best, as she only brought in a 15.2 for a lower difficulty routine than we normally see. She did her inbar full without connecting it to the Komova II to pak salto to Maloney to bail to Ray. Her Jaeger was hit, and her full-in was low…though she seems to have stuck it for a nice finish.\n\n12. Nica Hults, Texas Dreams, 56.900\n\nBeginning on bars, Hults hit her full pirouette to Maloney to bail to Ray, a huge Jaeger, and though she looked like she came off a little early before the full-out, she hit it with a step for a 14.35.\n\nOn beam, Hults hit a great series, a punch front tuck, a switch ring, and a side aerial before stumbling her 2.5 dismount forward for a 13.75.\n\n13. Brenna Dowell, GAGE, 29.050\n\nUnfortunately, bars was a rough outing for Brenna, who hit her Ray and then the best Tweddle to Ehzova I’ve seen her do. However, she muscled a pirouette on the low bar which seemed to shake her up. She hit the Maloney and giant full and the Church, but didn’t connect the Church to her pak salto and it sounded like her feet or heels brushed the ground. She finished with her van Leeuwen and a good landing on her double layout for a 13.65.\n\nEVENT RESULTS\n\nVault\n\n1. Simone Biles, 31.025\n\n2. Mykayla Skinner,\n\nUneven Bars\n\n1.

  "latent_23283": "The arbitrary budget cuts known as the sequester will exact a toll on not only domestic programs but military spending as well. Hence the howls in Washington from the Pentagon chieftains and their ardent Congressional supporters. But the truth is that the military budget not only can be cut, but should be cut, though not with this kind of political machete and not in the way the service chiefs say they plan to wield it.\n\nIf and when the sequester comes into play on March 1, it will force cuts totaling $85 billion in discretionary government spending over the next seven months. This includes $43 billion from defense programs, or 8 percent. Over the next 10 years, defense cuts are supposed to total $500 billion.\n\nIn recent weeks, Pentagon officials and military commanders have warned of catastrophic consequences, using the most operatic terminology they can find — “dire” and “devastating” cuts will reduce America’s military machine to a “hollow force” — to dramatize their point. Troops will be insufficiently trained and equipped, and thus be at greater risk of losing their lives if deployed to a conflict zone. Two carrier strike groups won’t be deployed as planned. The Navy will be forced to shut down four air wings, and after 90 days, pilots will lose their certifications and have to be retrained. The list goes on.\n\nSome of this is plainly hype. Both the generals and the civilians in the Pentagon know that some cuts are possible and that even under the sequester American security need not be compromised. The military has many resources, and in some respects it is over-resourced. Important budgetary accounts — military pay and benefits — are exempted from the sequester and, according to experts, the Pentagon has more flexibility than is commonly understood to weather these reductions.",
  "latent_23449": "The westernmost Chinese province of Xinjiang (新疆) — translated into English as 'New Frontier' — marks the border of Chinese society in more than just a geographic sense. Over the course of its countless rulerships, Xinjiang has epitomized the ethnic and cultural diversity at the nexus of Central Asia. From Middle Eastern traders traversing the Silk Road to Mongolian invaders pillaging all the way to Europe, Xinjiang's society has been incrementally molded by Asia's rich historical heritage.\n\nToday, the assortment of ethnicities that call the provence home has divided Xinjiang into dozens of ethnocultural borderlines. Amidst this jumble of civilizations, Josh Summers skillfully outlines the province's stunning ethnic and geographical features in Xinjiang: A Traveler's Guide to Far West China.\n\nTo portray the social idiosyncrasies and cultural nuances of any folk is by no means an easy task. Bearing in mind both the sheer geographic size of Xinjiang and the multiplicity of different ethnicities, this task is made the more difficult for Summers as a solo author. Despite these challenges, the guide captures the broad outlines of the province's ethnic ancestries as well as the subtle oddities of its traditions. Summers particularly demonstrates his passion and familiarity with the region through the anecdotes and stories he intersperses — from The Fragrant Concubine to the legend of The Three Immortal Caves, each page is a testament to the often untold affluence of Xinjiang's culture. Many of these narratives exemplify the cross-ethnic dialogue and subtle nuances between Xinjiang's native societies.\n\nThe Legend of the Fragrant Concubine, for instance, recounts the harrowing story of a enchantingly beautiful Uyghur woman, taken by a Han emperor as his concubine. While Han and Uyghur versions of the story diverge on the final fate of the woman, Summers's use of the tale gives the reader a fuller sense of Xinjiang's historical legacy. A Traveler's Guide to Far West China's meticulous and analytic approach to Xinjiang's culture adds vital facets to the region's allure, and highlights the author's level of intimacy with the province. In all of its tragedies, accomplishments and developments, Xinjiang's history and heritage are arguably one of the most overlooked and underrated aspects of Chinese society by those both inside and outside the country.\n\nThis potpourri of societies is only superseded by the astounding assortment of Xinjiang's geographical features. Home to both the towering Karakoram mountain range and the vast Taklamakan Desert, Xinjiang calls out to travelers for exploration. Summers, realizing the prominent appeal of the region, fills pages with descriptions of beautiful, mystic and often unexplored gems throughout the province. As a result, the guide seems specifically tailored to a more daring and venturesome demographic.\n\nComfort and luxury, the author admits, must often be left by the wayside in order to experience the full adventurous flavor of the region. Forget the Hilton and the Hyatt, visitors to Xinjiang can nestle themselves in the warm yak furs of the local yurt houses. For many, sleeping on prehistoric grasslands under the glistening stars may come as a much needed change from the monotony of hotel stays. Through his accessible writing and his extensive knowledge of the land, Summers manages to intoxicate even in more cautious readers a sense of adventurous stimulation.\n\nDespite the region's particular appeal to intrepid voyagers, the guide also pays notable attention to the nascent luxury tourism industry growing in certain areas of Xinjiang. Amidst the bustling streets of Urumqi and the peaks of Karakoram, explorers can find signs of the region's developing opulence and adjustment to demand for luxury travel opinions — including brand names such as the Raddison and Sheraton.\n\nHowever, Summers occasionally overplays the importance of these luxury alternatives, given the guide's audience. These periodic detours from Xinjiang's raw, unchartered appeal neglect some important facets of the region's traditions, particularly in regard to dining options. The author at times provides only sparse directions for finding local cuisine, and instead supplies equally as many Western dining alternatives. For Urumqi, the province's largest metropolis, the book only highlights five local restaurants, in addition to several Western fast food chains. A similar trend prevails in the choices for lodging.\n\nThese small quibbles, however, pale in comparison to Summers's ability to ferry his readers into the realm of Xinjiang — a land where ancient cultures populate the bucolic, and largely virgin landscape. Both expats living in China and foreigners picking up the guide will find themselves enticed by the allure of the region. That said, given the region's only budding tourism industry, travelers are expected to pack a penchant for the uncertain. An intellectual curiosity of different cultures — such as Summers' — does not hurt either when exploring one of China's last frontiers.\n\nXinjiang: A Traveler's Guide to Far West China was authored by Josh Summers and is available for Kindle on Amazon.

  "latent_23526": "The author of this post, Nathaniel Hood, is a Strong Towns partner. In addition to contributing to this site, you can read Nate's work at his blog, Thoughts on the Urban Environment, and at the new Minnesota-based transportation site Streets.MN. You can also follow him on Twitter.\n\nFor a place to be successful, it needs people. All types of people. This is why the idea of creating “entertainment districts” might not be such a great idea.\n\nProposals for entertainment districts occasionally sprout up in City Councils meetings as the next big thing. While it certainly is tempting in its efforts to capitalize on people’s passion for retail, sports, food and drink; it is a development prospect that should be viewed with skepticism.\n\nThis is a rendering of one proposed Vikings stadium; one that was slated to be part of a “sports entertainment district” in downtown Minneapolis. Sports entertainment is a large element in selling these districts, and fair enough, sports are something we value in our culture and it makes subsidizing these projects somewhat more tolerable to the general public. But is it worth it for the urban spaces they create?\n\nIn Minnesota, “the best stadium site got snubbed,” at least according to Steve Berg in the Star Tribune:\n\nPerhaps we’ve just witnessed the ultimate NIMBY encounter: America’s two most powerful religions squaring off against each other, with Christianity telling the National Football League: Not in my back yard! Build a Vikings stadium if you must, but not next door to the Basilica of St. Mary. [Star Tribune, January 26, 2012]\n\nIn the article, Berg’s arguments refuting Basilica of St. Mary’s Rev. John Bauer’s aren’t necessarily wrong. In fact, he points out holes in Rev. Bauer’s objections to the Linden Avenue site. Yet, none of this matters because Berg’s vision is, ironically, antithetical to his greater aspiration for Minneapolis urbanism.\n\nBerg wants to create a sports entertainment district centered around Target Field, a new Vikings stadium and the renovated Target Center. This is a misguided effort to create a place not worth being in. In my opinion, instead of asking how we could fund an entertainment district, we should be asking ourselves: do we even want an entertainment district?\n\nWhy? Because they lack the most crucial element of creating great places: people.\n\nWhile entertainment districts certainly have people during the odd event, they are otherwise deserts of large infrastructure investments. Don’t believe me? Check out examples of entertainment districts across the county in Cincinnati, Phoenix, Des Moines, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and even the so-called successes of Denver (here & here) and Los Angeles.\n\nEntertainment districts, even the best ones, fail at creating a lively mix of retail, residential, commercial and civic space. In fact, most all mega projects have failed in this regard. They are isolating locations, usually not worthy of the public affection beyond the handful of large sporting events, conventions or Friday night bar excursions. In fact, show me an existing or proposed entertainment district and I’ll show you a struggling city.\n\nLarge and mid-size towns have started to classify downtown’s as entertainment districts. This is a dangerous precedent to set and often times contradictory to Strong Towns place making principles. Kansas City’s Power and Light District comes to mind. It’s hard not to argue that the area is charming, fun, exciting and a few other hedonistic adjectives. It’s all of these things … if you’re 25. But, unfortunately, these types of environments don’t help in attracting other sorts into the urban settings; baby boomers and families with young children aren’t going to be attracted to these places.\n\nThat’s not to say that the activities that take place in the Power and Light District should be regulated or banned. Nor do I want to imply that sports stadiums don’t have a place in our urban environment. But, what I’m attempting to say is that downtowns need to be a place for everyone. Entertainment districts don’t do a good job that, and they certainly don’t offer good urban outcomes – often times they replicate the same symptoms of urban malls.\n\nParis and Florence don’t have entertainment district. Neither does San Francisco. Melbourne doesn’t either. What these cities have are spaces for people. They also have sports stadiums and bars – just not as the focal points of their city centers.\n\nWhen a large building fails at creating a lively mix of retail, residential, commercial and civic space – it creates an isolating space not worthy of the public affection. It doesn’t help that these places aren’t cheap – taxpayers usually end up taking on the initial bill, and all the risk. Entertainment districts are the new “Bilbao anomaly” are the new urban mall, are the downtown casino, the list goes on. Regardless, at the end of the day, strong towns don’t create “entertainment districts”, they should create places.\n\nIf you value our work, please consider making a tax-deductible donation to support this blog and our other efforts to build a stronger, more resilient America.

  "latent_23700": "Acting DEA Administrator Chuck Rosenberg, seen here in 2007 when he was U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)\n\nLast week, the acting chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration called medical marijuana \"a joke\" during a Q&A with reporters. Now, medical marijuana patients are calling for his head, with an online petition demanding his resignation attracting over 10,000 signatures on change.org.\n\nHere's what administrator Chuck Rosenberg said about medical marijuana, via CBS News:\n\n\"What really bothers me is the notion that marijuana is also medicinal -- because it's not,\" Rosenberg said in a briefing to reporters. \"We can have an intellectually honest debate about whether we should legalize something that is bad and dangerous, but don't call it medicine -- that is a joke.\" [...] \"There are pieces of marijuana -- extracts or constituents or component parts -- that have great promise\" medicinally, he said. \"But if you talk about smoking the leaf of marijuana -- which is what people are talking about when they talk about medicinal marijuana -- it has never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine.\"\n\nRosenberg's argument that smoking marijuana \"has never been shown to be safe or effective as a medicine\" has been contradicted by numerous studies. A meta-analysis of 79 medical marijuana studies involving 6,462 patients, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association earlier this year, found \"moderate-quality evidence to support the use of cannabinoids for the treatment of chronic pain and spasticity.\" There was low-quality evidence suggesting marijuana had therapeutic applications for other conditions as well.\n\nThe finding that marijuana is effective at treating chronic pain is a big deal. High-caliber prescription painkillers are highly addictive and potentially deadly when misused -- they killed over 16,000 people via overdose in 2013, according to the CDC. Numerous studies have found that at the state level, the availability of medical marijuana is associated with a significant reduction of painkiller abuse rates and overdose deaths -- presumably, as patients opt to treat their pain with marijuana rather than painkillers.\n\nRosenberg's statements about medical marijuana aren't surprising when you consider that they comport with the official position of the DEA. The Administration considers marijuana a \"Schedule 1\" controlled substance, which among other things means it has \"no currently accepted medical use.\" Most researchers reject this claim, however, with organizations including Brookings Institution, the American Medical Association, and the ACLU arguing that the current designation is inappropriate.\n\nGiven all this, marijuana advocates are furious at what they see as the DEA's dismissal of the science behind medical pot.\n\n\"My mom is a legal patient in Rhode Island, and she uses medical marijuana to deal with the severe pain she experiences from multiple sclerosis,\" said Tom Angell, chairman of the group Marijuana Majority, which started the petition. \"Medical cannabis is no joke to my family or the millions of other American families who have seen its real benefits.\"\n\nIn an e-mailed statement, a DEA spokesperson sought to clarify Rosenberg's remarks. \"To clarify, Acting Administrator Rosenberg indicated that marijuana should be subject to the same levels of approval and scrutiny as any other substance intended for use as a medicine. DEA supports efforts to research potential medical uses of marijuana. To this end, DEA has never denied a registration request from anyone conducting marijuana research using FDA approved protocols.\"\n\nThe spokesman added, \"acting Administrator Rosenberg was also clear to point out there are a number of marijuana components and/or extracts which appear to show promise as medicines, but have not yet been approved as safe and effective. His comments reflected the fact that FDA has not approved any medicinal uses for smoked marijuana.\"\n\nThis wouldn't be the first time Rosenberg has courted controversy over marijuana during his tenure as DEA administrator. Over the summer, he said that marijuana was \"probably not\" as dangerous as heroin, and then one week later clarified that \"heroin is clearly more dangerous than marijuana.\" For the record, over 8,200 people died from heroin in 2013, compared to zero known marijuana overdose deaths.\n\nThe previous DEA chief, Michele Leonhart, had a rocky relationship with the Obama administration as well -- especially when it came to drug policy issues, which she often criticized the administration on. Leonhart left her post under a cloud of scandal earlier this year, prompting cheers from drug policy reform advocates and hopes that her successor would change the DEA's tone on certain drug policy issues.",
  "latent_23723": "Los Angeles doesn't always play itself in the movies. But when it does, no other city captures the imagination of filmmakers quite like it can. New York City might get top billing more often, but it doesn't have the range. L.A. can be a place of dreams, a nightmarish sprawl, infested with criminals, a cultural void or sunny paradise—sometimes all within the same film.\n\nThere is an endless number of films where the L.A. setting is an integral part of the film, and thankfully many are on Netflix for your instant satisfaction. Here are the best films on the platform that celebrate our fair city.\n\n(Please note that every month there are dozens of films that are added and removed from Netflix. This list is just a snapshot of what's available as of publication.)\n\nCLUELESS (directed by Amy Heckerling)\n\nClueless is like totally one of the best films of the 1990s, if only for the big screen introduction of Paul Rudd as an affable, mostly-responsible heartthrob. In this riff on Jane Austen's Emma, Alicia Silverstone plays Cher Horowitz, a wealthy, teenage Angeleno preoccupied with matchmaking and the mall. Her drama is very Los Angeles—much of it takes place while driving (in convertibles, duh), from arguing about directions, the struggle to merge onto the freeway, and trying (and failing) to avoid the Valley. Plus, we get one of the gnarliest burns when Tai (Brittany Murphy, R.I.P.) tells Cher, \"You're a virgin who can't drive.\" Way harsh, Tai, indeed. — Devon McReynolds\n\nSUNSET BOULEVARD (directed by Billy Wilder)\n\nHollywood devours itself in Billy Wilder's 1950 classic. When two individuals kicked to the curb by the biz (a down-on-his-luck screenwriter and a forgotten star of the silent era) find their way into each other's orbit, the film dives into the dark side of Hollywood: the one of past glories hung onto for far too long and hapless attempts at fame. That Paramount Pictures was willing to not only produce Sunset Boulevard, but also serve as a setting goes to show that the industry has a sick and twisted sense of humor about itself.\n\nWHO FRAMED ROGER RABBIT (directed by Robert Zemeckis)\n\nThe announcement of the Space Jam sequel captured the imagination of nostalgic millennials, so now is as good a time as any to revisit the underrated live-action/cartoon mashup that predated the first Space Jam by eight years. Who Framed Roger Rabbit's reimagining of the mythic demise of the Red Car is a perverse, cartoonishly (of course) violent and immaculately crafted film whose enduring legacy is, sadly, a ride for children at Disneyland.\n\nPULP FICTION (directed by Quentin Tarantino)\n\nWith Pulp Fiction, Quentin Tarantino managed to make an eternally cool film set in Los Angeles without venturing into any of its glamorous spots (save for the Wallaces' house somewhere in the Hollywood Hills). Its sharp-dressed hitmen get their jobs done at the drab, postwar apartment buildings we all live in, and they settle for the same diners we eat at when we also find ourselves in an unfamiliar part of the Valley or South Bay. Tarantino's L.A.-set Reservoir Dogs is also available on Netflix.\n\nPUNCH-DRUNK LOVE (directed by Paul Thomas Anderson)\n\nThe gangster saga by way of crumbling porn empire saga Boogie Nights (also on Netflix) is the most popular Paul Thomas Anderson film, but I'll take Punch-Drunk Love (and the not-on-Netflix Inherent Vice) as the quintessential PT(L)A film. Shunning the sexier, more glamorous corners of the town for his old stomping grounds of the San Fernando Valley (\"[N]o other director has ever portrayed the Valley as Anderson does: lovingly,\" wrote Molly Lambert in Grantland), Anderson turns the suburban sprawl and cookie-cutter concrete blocks into a colorful, wildly romantic Tatiesque playground. A passing truck on Lankershim Boulevard literally sings along to the tune of the film, and the sprawling grid of streetlights creates an atmosphere that is at once both eerie and beautiful.\n\nASHES AND EMBERS (directed by Haile Gerima)\n\nOne of the great injustices of cinema is that the black voices of the L.A. Rebellion still haven't received their due, no matter how many times Charles Burnett's Killer of Sheep gets lauded or Thom Andersen champions their work. As a result, the majority of it remains unavailable outside of occasional screenings. Thankfully, Julie Dash's Daughters of the Dust is headed back to the big screen this year and Haile Gerima's Ashes and Embers is now available on Netflix. As described in the New York Times as exploring, \"the experience of a black Vietnam veteran trying to come to terms with American life,\" it's in Los Angeles \"where he hopes to find his future, and instead winds up in police custody.\" Also available on Netflix is Burnett's The Glass Shield, starring Ice Cube as a man whose arrest is the catalyst for the uncovering of corruption and racism within the LAPD.\n\nSWINGERS (directed by Doug Liman)\n\nSwingers the film and the real-life story of the film are a quintessential Only In L.A. tale. \"Like a prequel to Entourage (but way more tolerable), Swingers follows a group of struggling actors in Los Angeles who hang out, swing dance, bemoan the state of their careers, and try to get laid\" as they jaunt about Los Feliz haunts like The Dresden Lounge and the departed Derby, writes Kyle Buchanan in Vulture. With its critical success, modest box office and eventual cult following, Vince Vaughn would go on to become a star and co-star and screenwriter Jon Favreau would become a blockbuster director. Favreau would come back to Los Angeles, writing, directing and starring in 2014's Chef (also on Netflix).\n\nRED HOLLYWOOD (directed by Thom Andersen and Noël Burch)\n\nUnfortunately, Thom Andersen's superb film essay Los Angeles Plays Itself is no longer on Netflix, but we still have Red Hollywood (co-directed and co-written by Noël Burch). While the common narrative of the Hollywood blacklist (served to Oscar voters recently as Trumbo) is one of martyrs punished for doing nothing wrong, \"It would be an injustice to those who were blacklisted to say they did nothing to deserve it\" Andersen and the film argue. Instead, Red Hollywood argues that the Hollywood screenwriters, actors, and filmmakers that were shunned by the House Un-American Activities Committed truly were the subversive men and women they were feared to be. The version on Netflix is a re-edit and remaster of the original 1996 documentary.\n\nESCAPE FROM L.A. (directed by John Carpenter)\n\nJohn Carpenter's vision of a future (2013, in this 1996 film) Los Angeles is probably how Tea Partiers see us: a Sodom and Gomorrah separated from the mainland by natural disasters of Biblical proportions. Snake Plissken (Kurt Russell) just can't keep himself away from these places. It's probably not too far removed from reality, anyway, depending on how this upcoming election goes. Vote wisely.\n\nSOMEWHERE (directed by Sofia Coppola)\n\nSofia Coppola's divisive Somewhere is the ultimate Chill L.A. Weekend movie—what could be a more perfect way to relax than poolside at the Chateau Marmont and do absolutely nothing. For Somewhere, Coppola was given rare and complete access to the landmark hotel, L.A.'s own shining castle upon a hill. Somewhere was shot by the late Harry Savides, whose outstanding work of capturing L.A.'s hazy sunlight also includes Noah Baumbach's Greenberg (also on Netflix) and Coppola's Bling Ring.\n\nAlso on Netflix: Nightcrawler, Changeling, Tangerine, Beginners, The Canyons, Beyond The Lights\n\nAnd we'd be remiss to not mention...\n\nBOJACK HORSEMAN\n\nNetflix's own animated series is a cynical skewering of celebrity culture and a brutally honest depiction of depression, done through the lens of anthropomorphized animals whose names are dadjoke-level puns. Both melancholic and laugh-out-loud hilarious, all while being downright bizarre. Everything in L.A. is made an easy target for jokes: Hollywoo (not a typo), bad sitcoms, Crossfit, Scientology, improv comedy troupes and c-list celebs (did you catch the Angelfish billboard?) to name a few. Can't wait for the third season.\n\nRelated: Los Angeles' Best Romantic Comedies",

Courtesy of U.S. Navy/Mass Communication Specialist 2nd Class Leonard Adams/Handout via REUTERS\n\nMultiple U.S. and Japanese investigations are under way into how the USS Fitzgerald, a guided missile destroyer, and the much larger ACX Crystal container ship collided in clear weather south of Tokyo Bay in the early hours of June 17.\n\nThe collision tore a gash below the Fitzgerald’s waterline, killing seven sailors in what was the greatest loss of life on a U.S. Navy vessel since the USS Cole was bombed in Yemen’s Aden harbor in 2000.\n\n“There was not a lot that went right leading up to the crash. There were a string of errors, but they did a lot after the collision to save lives and the ship,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity.\n\nThe official said that in addition to crew members not paying attention to their surroundings, they did not take action until it was too late.\n\nWhile the investigation is not complete, the official said crew members had given statements and radar data had been gathered, and it was unlikely the findings would change.\n\nA U.S. Navy spokeswoman said the investigation was in the early stages and it was premature to speculate on the causes.\n\nThe incident has spurred a number of investigations, including those by the U.S. Navy and a probe by the United States Coast Guard on behalf of the National Transportation Safety Board.

  "latent_23897": "It was a typical day in the cloud. I was at my desk, streaming music onto my phone, collaborating with colleagues on synced files hosted online; I then killed a little time by horsing around on a discussion board with some friends.\n\nThe difference was, this cloud wasn’t part of Google or Dropbox. It was … mine, hosted out of an old computer parked under my kitchen table. It streams, syncs files across computers, and does basic social networking. I can access it online from any computer or my mobile phone.\n\nBut it’s a “personal cloud”: I own and run the hardware. The simple act of building and running it has given me a glimpse of a possible alternate future for the Internet. It’s an increasingly popular one too.\n\nThat’s the Edward Snowden effect: People now know that the cloud isn’t intangible. It’s hardware run by large companies, snoopable by spy agencies.\n\nThe software I used, Tonido, has been around a few years, but its user base doubled to more than 1 million people in 2012—mostly in the second half of the year. Last summer BitTorrent released personal-cloud software called Sync, and by December it had already amassed 2 million users. That’s partly the Edward Snowden effect: People now know that the cloud isn’t intangible. It’s hardware run by large companies, snoopable by spy agencies. “2013 was the year that everyone became aware of what a server was,” BitTorrent CEO Eric Klinker says. “With Sync, if anybody wants to know what you’re doing, they can’t go and ask one of the big servers. They have to hand the warrant to you.”\n\nBut as I discovered, running a cloud brings with it deeper and weirder pleasures. When you’re master of your own domain, you subtly change your relationship to being online. In a thread with friends on my Tonido service, I discovered that I was far more willing to be jokey or nuts or to curse like a sailor. I was no longer worried about my postings suddenly becoming public without my knowledge, as when Facebook “revises” its privacy settings in the middle of the night.\n\nAnother outcome: You realize that, holy Moses, putting stuff online is not rocket science anymore. The “convenience” argument—we give up privacy to big cloud firms because they make things easy—begins to erode. Running a home server used to require nerd judo, but with Tonido it took me about 15 minutes to set up and a few minutes more to invite friends in. It’ll work on whatever decrepit laptop you’ve got lying around.\n\nThe ‘convenience’ argument — we give up privacy to big cloud firms because they make things easy — begins to erode.\n\nIn fact, these tools can perform even better than corporate stuff: Since BitTorrent Sync has no data limits, users move 40 times more data over it than people sync on Dropbox.\n\nGranted, personal clouds create new problems. A blizzard knocked out my DSL for a day, taking my cloud with it. A house fire destroys not just your laptop but your cloud backup as well. I don’t have a Google-size phalanx of programmers to keep hackers at bay. Tonido’s social software is functional but super-ugly, and, frankly, part of the point of huge public social networks like Facebook is that they are huge. And public.\n\nSo personal clouds will be used selectively—by people bringing the truly private parts of their lives (sensitive documents, personal discussions) back under their control. Imagine today’s teenagers realizing they can run a free, invitation-only social network on their computer or smartphone. The mind reels.\n\nThe cloud just might come back to earth.",
  "latent_23909": "CLOSE Critics say Spacey is conflating being gay with sexual misconduct with a minor. Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nKevin Spacey, pictured in June, faces new allegations of making advances on a teen. (Photo: ANGELA WEISS, AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe list of allegations facing Kevin Spacey continues to grow after actor Anthony Rapp accused Spacey of making unwanted sexual advances on him when he was 14, as published by BuzzFeed Sunday night.\n\nThe latest developments:\n\nKevin Spacey plans to 'seek evaluation and treatment'\n\nOn Wednesday night, Spacey's representative Staci Wolfe shared this statement: \"Kevin Spacey is taking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment. No other information is available at this time,” she told USA TODAY.\n\nNetflix and Media Rights Capital, which produces his series House of Cards, followed that statement with its own, saying, \"We view Kevin seeking treatment as a positive step. We continue to take this hiatus time to evaluate our path forward as it relates to the production.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Netflix announced it would shut down production of the sixth and final season of Cards \"until further notice.\" Netflix also is in post-production on Gore, a biopic of writer Gore Vidal, that had been scheduled for release in 2018.\n\nFilmmaker Tony Montana says Spacey \"grabbed my whole package\" in bar in 2003\n\nAnother accuser of Spacey has come forward, filmmaker Tony Montana, who says a drunken Spacey confronted him in 2003 at a trendy Los Angeles pub, groping his genitals and telling him, \"This designates ownership.\"\n\n\"He grabbed my whole package, he grabbed me hard; no one had ever done that to me,\" Montana told USA TODAY, speaking from Seattle where he is shooting a movie about a Hollywood director spinning out of control and forced to face his demons.\n\nMontana was surprised to see Spacey, whom he recognized but had never seen before in the Coronet Pub, a hangout for some Hollywood types at the time. Montana said he had never heard any stories of Spacey taking such licenses.\n\n\"(Spacey's behavior) didn't matter to me until he grabbed me because I'm straight,\" Montana said.\n\nMontana, then in his 30s, pushed his hand away (turning Spacey's thumb back in a martial-arts move). Then Spacey, whom he described as being falling-down drunk, followed him into the bathroom and practically fell on him.\n\n\"I pushed him back, backed him out of the bathroom and told his friends, 'Time to take your boy home,' \" Montana said.\n\nFilmmaker Tony Montana, left, with director Mark Brian Smith after their documentary, 'Overnight,' came out in 2003. (Photo: John Sciulli, WireImage)\n\nHe never said anything publicly about his Spacey encounter, in part for an ironic reason.\n\nAt the time, Montana was working on a documentary, 2003's Overnight, about filmmaker Troy Duffy, who'd been blacklisted by Harvey Weinstein, and was afraid that if he spoke up about Spacey, the mogul might find out about the project and threaten his chances of getting it made or released.\n\n“I couldn’t tell anyone what I was doing lest it get back to Harvey and he'd sue me before I could get insurance (for the film),\" Montana says. \"And I was reluctant because I thought nothing would come of it.\"\n\nAlthough people in the bar saw his reaction and saw him grab Spacey's hand, he didn't think anyone would confirm his story. At the time, he says, everyone in Hollywood knew not to talk negatively about \"certain people in the industry, particularly if they were carrying their sexuality close to the vest ... People just wouldn’t say anything, they would talk among their friends and (compare) the same stories.\"\n\nSo he said nothing. Instead, he suffered post-traumatic stress disorder as a result, and eventually went on with his career. Then Anthony Rapp made his explosive allegation against Spacey Sunday night.\n\n\"I went, 'he did it to somebody else,' \" says Montana, who says he isn't seeking money or an apology from Spacey. After the Weinstein scandal broke, \"People were feeling free to speak ... I thought I need to come forward with this ... If Anthony had not come forward, I would not have — I would have kept it to myself forever.\"\n\nMontana credits Rapp but he also points to the involvement of Weinstein. \"He is the haunting figure in all this,\" Montana says. Spacey may be tormented, too, he says. \"Things that happened 30 years ago or 14 years ago, they can come back to haunt you.\"\n\nStill, he points out, Weinstein's career and power have been destroyed, all in about five days. Spacey may yet survive, he says, partly because he's far more likable than Weinstein ever was. He speculates that Spacey's comeback chances will be better if he goes public with a proper mix of contrition and humor at his own expense.\n\n\"He has a high likeability factor, people liked House of Cards, they've always liked him,\" Montana says.\n\nA request for comment from Spacey's reps was not immediately returned.\n\nBBC publishes account of anonymous accuser\n\nJoining Rapp and Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who came forward with similar allegations Tuesday, is an anonymous man identified by the BBC as John.\n\nIn an interview with the news outlet's Victoria Derbyshire published Wednesday, the man described a weekend he allegedly spent with Spacey in New York in the 1980s as a teen.\n\nJohn said he initially perceived Spacey as \"charming and brotherly,\" but, on the first night, Spacey invited John into his bed. John instead opted for the sofa.\n\n\"We went to sleep,\" John recounted. \"He was sobbing from his bed, which I knew enough to know that that was likely meant to get me to respond in some way, which I didn't. I just sort of tried to make it through the evening.\"\n\nMore: Kevin Spacey scandal: 'This Is Us' cuts Spacey reference, 'House of Cards' suspends production\n\nMore: Kevin Spacey allegations: Zachary Quinto, 'House of Cards' creator, Rose McGowan react\n\nMore: Kevin Spacey apologizes after actor accuses him of sexual harassment, comes out as gay\n\n\"In the morning,\" John continued, \"I woke up and his head was on my stomach and his arms were wrapped around my torso very affectionately, I would suppose.\"\n\nJohn said that while he was wearing clothes, Spacey was in his underwear.\n\n\"(It) certainly wasn't aggressive but it was affectionate and certainly not something I was comfortable with as a heterosexual male,\" John said, \"but not something I was gonna jump out a window over.\"\n\nUSA TODAY has not independently verified the BBC report. A request for comment from Spacey's reps was not immediately answered.\n\nSpacey addressed Rapp's allegations via Twitter Sunday explaining that though he did not \"remember the encounter\" he owes Rapp \"the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior.\"\n\nIn the statement, Spacey also took the opportunity to come out \"as a gay man.\"\n\nContributing: Carly Mallenbaum\n\nRead or Share this story: https://usat.ly/2zXU9lf",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nAug. 16, 2016, 2:19 PM GMT / Updated Aug. 16, 2016, 2:49 PM GMT By Pete Williams\n\nNorth Carolina asked the U.S. Supreme Court Tuesday to put a hold on last month's federal appeals court ruling that struck down one of the nation's toughest voter ID laws.\n\nThe state said \"in order to avoid voter confusion\" it should be allowed to enforce several parts of its law that had been in effect before a federal appeals court declared them invalid.\n\nIn a blistering decision in July, the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals said the North Carolina legislature explicitly set out to discover what kind of accommodations minority voters use most often and then to roll back or eliminate them, targeting African Americans \"with almost surgical precision.\"\n\nBut in asking the Supreme Court to put a hold on that ruling, the state said \"North Carolina should not be forced to scramble mere months before the general election to rejigger settled election plans at the Fourth Circuit's command.\"\n\nRelated: Voting Fight Shifts to Local Level In North Carolina\n\nSpecifically, the state asked the Supreme Court to let it continue to enforce its voter ID law, which was in effect during this year's primary, and also to limit early voting to 10 days instead of 17 as the state originally did, and to bar pre-registration by 16 year olds.\n\nEric Gandah walks past a NC Voter ID sign as he enters a precinct to cast his ballot in Greensboro, N.C. on March 15, 2016. A federal appeals court on Friday, July, 29, 2016, blocked a North Carolina law that required voters to produce photo identification and follow other rules disproportionately affecting minorities, finding that the law was intended to make it harder for blacks to vote in the presidential battleground state. H. Scott Hoffmann / News & Record via AP, file\n\nThe state did not seek to put a hold on other parts of the Fourth Circuit ruling, which means same-day registration will be allowed, and votes will be counted if they are cast in the wrong precinct.\n\nIn the past, the Supreme Court has been responsive to arguments from the states that last-minute changes in voting procedures are confusing. But in this case, North Carolina may have weakened its ability to rely on that claim, because the state waited 17 days to challenge the appeals court ruling.\n\nRelated: Appeals Court Rejects Strict North Carolina Voting Law\n\nNotably absent from the legal documents filed with the Supreme Court was North Carolina's attorney general, who has said he will not defend the law. Instead, the state retained three private law firms to file the emergency motion.\n\nNorth Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory said in a statement that his state's voter ID law \"has been cited as a model and other states are using similar laws without challenges\".\n\n\"Allowing the Fourth Circuit's ruling to stand creates confusion among voters and poll workers and it disregards our successful rollout of Voter ID in the 2016 primary elections,\" McCrory said in a statement. \"The Fourth Circuit's ruling is just plain wrong and we cannot allow it to stand. We are confident that the Supreme Court will uphold our state’s law and reverse the Fourth Circuit.\"",

It also impacted many of our combat systems, leading to inconsistent or undesirable behavior such as snipers missing the infantry.\n\nHit the dirt now provides light cover rather than a 0.5 received accuracy modifier.\n\nJU-87D Strafing Run\n\nThe JU-87D Strafing Run now functions as a suppression ability. The loiter behavior was modified to improve the visuals of the off-map and make it more susceptible to anti-air weapons.\n\nAttacks per aircraft from 5 to 3\n\nDelay between attacks from 3s to 18s\n\nDuration time from 48s to 75s\n\nTarget lead in from 50 to 20\n\nTarget lead out from 60 to 20\n\nTarget attack distance from 150 to 225\n\nTarget attack time from 2.125 to 4.25\n\nModified UI barrage radius to match the loiter radius of the JU-87D\n\nDamage from 8 to 2.5\n\nRate of fire from 32 to 16\n\nSuppression from 0.12 to 0.25\n\nMax range from 175 to 225\n\nOpel Blitz Cargo Truck\n\nPreviously, the cargo truck was multiplying a sectors value by a factor of 2. This resulted in extreme edge cases where fuel and munition incomes were higher than expected. To resolve this, supply trucks will only add a set amount of resources to sectors.\n\nA cargo truck setup within a sector now adds 3 fuel and 5 munitions per minute, rather than multiplying the sectors value by 2\n\nCargo truck cost from 200 to 300 manpower\n\nAdjustments to Scatter Distance\n\nThe following units had their scatter distance refactored to better match their performance and design. Higher scatter values generally implies weapons are less accurate.\n\nIS-2\n\n• Scatter distance max from 7.5 to 2.86\n\n• Scatter distance max from 7.5 to 2.86 Panzer IV\n\n• Scatter distance max from 6 to 9.5\n\n• Scatter distance max from 6 to 9.5 T70\n\n• Scatter distance max from 1.84 to 1.7\n\n• Scatter distance max from 1.84 to 1.7 T34-85\n\n• Scatter distance max from 3.4 to 2.6\n\n• Scatter distance max from 3.4 to 2.6 Tiger\n\n• Scatter distance max from 6.8 to 4.3\n\n• Scatter distance max from 6.8 to 4.3 Ostwind\n\n• Scatter distance max from 1.98 to 2.15\n\n• Scatter distance max from 1.98 to 2.15 Brummbar\n\n• Scatter distance max from 4.55 to 1\n\nHMG Suppression Modifiers\n\nHMG teams no longer function efficiently while pinned. This discourages tactics such as moving a HMG team into a setup HMG team unless on the flank. Pinned HMG squads now have the following modifiers applied to their squad:\n\nWeapon accuracy is now reduced by 75%\n\nWeapons reload has been increased by 100%\n\nWeapon cooldown has been increased by 100%\n\nWeapon scatter has been increased by 320%\n\nThe Maxim HMG now properly has its movement reduced while suppressed\n\nCorrection from Patch on June 13\n\nStug target size set from 20 to 14\n\nRiegel AT Mine recharge from 30s to 0s\n\nBug Fixes\n\nCommand tank now properly validates, this prevents the user from using the call in when they are near max pop.\n\nIncendiary barrage duration now better matches its deployment time.\n\nWhen Quinn Duffy told us to put our cameras away, before he led us through Relic Entertainment studios in Vancouver, we hoped to see some great new stuff being developed for Company of Heroes 2. About half way through the tour, we came to a room that was alive with commotion. Out of the many desks in the room, each with a developer diligently working away, four of them were literally popping with energy and the frenetic clicking of mouse and keyboard. Four of the devs were battling like mad dogs. But what map is that? Wait a second, I recognize that minimap. Is it really... Langres on COH2? Awe hell yeah!Tomorrow's patch will introduce \"Langreskaya\" to Company of Heroes 2, in both Summer and Winter forms. This is a new version of the competition map from COH1, originally created by community map-maker Micheal \"\" Scharhag, that we have seen in countless tournaments and Sunday Night Fights bouts. The original map was a member of the \"Big 3\" (Semois, Angoville, Langres), known affectionately as simply \"SemAngLang.\" The map has been revamped by the Relic team to fit the Eastern Front. It's got new houses, huge hay barrels, and gorgeous terrain textures. We are thrilled to welcome this classic map back into the pool.\"Langreskaya\" is playable in both 1v1 and 2v2 formats in custom games, but will only be introduced in automatch for 1v1. A great decision by Relic! We look forward to some fantastic battles, which will surely be featured on upcoming Livestreams, Vods, and in our Replays section. Good luck achieving the Langrekayas pin! It ain't so easy with M3s and Scout Cars running around!And keep your weekend open, August 3rd and 4th. The rest of the patch notes, including highly requested adjustments to Strafes, MGs, Hit the Dirt, and the Opel Blitz Truck, can be found after the pics.What do you think of the new maps and the balance changes?

  "latent_24867": "A South Korean military officer shows pictures of North Korean \"wooden box\" land mines during a briefing at the Defence Ministry in Seoul on August 10, 2015 (AFP Photo/Yonhap )\n\nSeoul (AFP) - South Korea on Monday threatened \"harsh\" retaliation after blaming North Korea for landmine blasts that maimed two soldiers on border patrol, ramping up military tensions on the divided peninsula.\n\nThe US-led United Nations Command which oversees the armistice that ended the 1950-53 Korean War, said analysis of the mine debris showed them to be North Korean \"wooden box\" landmines placed on a known South Korean border patrol path.\n\n\"The investigation determined that the devices were recently emplaced,\" it said, ruling out the possibility they were old mines displaced over the border by shifting soil patterns.\n\nThe three landmines were detonated by members of a military patrol last Tuesday in the South Korean half of the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) -- a buffer area flanking both sides of the inter-Korean frontier.\n\nOne soldier underwent a double leg amputation, while another had one leg removed.\n\n\"We are certain they were North Korean landmines planted with an intention to kill by our enemies who sneaked across the military border,\" Defence Ministry spokesman Kim Min-Seok told reporters.\n\n- 'Pay a harsh price' -\n\nThe South's Joint Chiefs of Staff vowed that North Korea would \"pay a harsh price proportionate for the provocation it made\".\n\nDescribing the attack as a \"baseless act\" and \"wanton violation\" of non-aggression accords, it urged the North to apologise and punish those responsible.\n\nThe defence ministry declined to comment on what was meant by \"harsh price\" or speculate on the retaliatory options being considered.\n\nAnalysts said the type of incident made a proportionate response difficult to gauge.\n\n\"Realistically, it's hard to see what South Korea can actually do,\" said Dan Pinkston, Korea expert at the International Crisis Group in Seoul.\n\n\"It's an unacceptable breach of the armistice terms, but you don't want to escalate the situation so it spins out of control. It's very difficult,\" Pinkston told AFP.\n\nThere was no immediate reaction from North Korea.\n\nBecause the 1953 armistice was never replaced with a peace treaty, the two Koreas remain technically at war and the DMZ -- despite its name -- is one of the most heavily-militarised frontiers on the planet.\n\nMore than a million mines are believed to have been planted along the border, including those air-dropped in great numbers in the 1960s at the height of a Cold War confrontation with the North.\n\nYang Moo-Jin, a professor at the University of North Korean Studies in Seoul, said North Korea was almost certain to deny planting the mines, and added that it was difficult to deduce any motive for such an operation.\n\n\"Whatever the reason, South Korea has limited options to respond, especially inside the DMZ where military activity is so closely controlled and monitored,\" Yang said.\n\nSome analysts suggested it was a pre-emptive attempt to raise tensions before a major South Korea-US military exercise scheduled to begin next week.\n\nOn Saturday North Korea had promised a \"tough military counter-action\" if the joint drill went ahead.\n\nThe last direct attack on the South was in November 2010 when North Korea shelled the South Korean border island of Yeonpyeong, killing two civilians and two soldiers.\n\nSouth Korea responded by shelling North Korean positions, triggering brief fears of a full-scale conflict.\n\nThe latest incident comes at a sensitive time, with both Koreas preparing to commemorate the 70th anniversary on Saturday of the 1945 liberation of the Korean peninsula from Japanese rule.\n\nThere had been hopes that the anniversary might open an opportunity for some sort of rapprochement, but efforts to organise a joint commemoration went nowhere. Pyongyang refused to consider talks because of Seoul's refusal to cancel its military drills with the United States.",

  "latent_24911": "The nation’s largest real estate brokerage is warning agents who work out of more than 200 offices in the northeastern U.S. not to commission drone photography from vendors until the Federal Aviation Administration issues “clearly defined rules” governing the commercial operation of drones.\n\nUntil that happens, Realogy subsidiary NRT LLC says it won’t even process or distribute images captured by drones that are provided to it by sales associates in the affected regions.\n\nThe warning — sent by NRT LLC attorneys to presidents and the marketing team of NRT’s Eastern Seaboard and Northeast regions — was obtained by Forbes contributor Gregory McNeal, who covers law and policy for the publication.\n\nIt was sent to executives who oversee more than 12,000 agents who work at eight Coldwell Banker-branded operations in Connecticut; Westchester, New York; Long Island; New England; New Jersey; Rockland County, New York; Pittsburgh; and the Greater Philadelphia area, and NRT’s ERA-branded operation in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.\n\nIn the July 1 memo, NRT attorneys Mark Daaleman and Bob McCauley warned that even though the FAA is still in the process of drafting rules that will govern commercial drone operators, it “has issued fines and penalties” to people operating drones for commercial purposes or in restricted airspace, and “continues to take an aggressive stance regarding the use of drones specifically for real estate marketing” purposes.\n\nLast month the FAA warned real estate agents who fly their own drones to take pictures or videos of listings that they are not engaged in a “hobby or recreation,” meaning that regulators could attempt to take enforcement actions against them. Although the FAA has issued numerous cease-and-desist letters to alleged commercial drone operators, its ability to collect fines against them should it pursue enforcement actions against them remains a matter of dispute.\n\nIn March, an administrative judge dismissed the only case in which the FAA has attempted to fine a drone operator, saying the policy notices regulators had previously issued governing commercial operation of drones were not produced through a formal rule-making process. The FAA has appealed that decision, and maintains that commercial drone operators “are subject to all existing FAA regulations” while the new rules for drones are being finalized.\n\nUntil the FAA issues clearly defined rules governing the commercial operation of drones, the NRT attorneys said, “our companies in the Northeast and Eastern Seaboard regions will not be procuring drone photography from any vendor, nor will we process and distribute any drone photography provided to the company by an affiliated sales associate.”\n\nDaaleman and McCauley said they “strongly advise” sales associates “not to seek drone photography on their own” because they “may be held responsible for all fines, penalties, costs and fees related to the use of that photography.”\n\nIt’s unclear whether NRT issued similar warnings to other regions. The Northeast region may be of particular concern because the FHA recently subpoenaed at least one brokerage with offices in New York City for information about how the company, which is not affiliated with Realogy or NRT, uses drones for marketing.\n\nNRT spokeswoman Kathy Burruso declined to comment on the memo, saying, “We’re just trying to point people towards the NAR website for its guidance on this.”\n\nNAR has advised Realtors against using drones for real estate marketing until the FAA issues further guidance or regulations.\n\nTelling real estate agents to stop flying drones as part of their work, is one thing, but NRT’s decision to also reject drone footage submitted by agents “is a troubling development in an ongoing saga over the FAA’s rules which punish the safe commercial use of drones,” McNeal said in reporting on the memo for Forbes.\n\nNRT “is a big player in this space,” he said, and its decision to prohibit the use of drone footage “will have a chilling impact on thousands of Realtors, and may set back efforts to convince the FAA to allow the safe use of drones for commercial filming.”",

  "latent_25070": "In the penultimate game of the regular season, New York City FC faces a stiff test in surging D.C. United.\n\nWhat is the key to victory for NYCFC?\n\nAccording to Andoni Iraola, it is all about sticking to what has worked throughout the season.\n\n“Obviously we want to do what we are doing now,” the midfielder said. “We want to keep the ball, have a good buildup from the back, try to play to our right and that’s what we’re trying to work on this week. I think we will be ready for Sunday.”\n\nIraola has been a steady presence as a deep lying midfielder for NYCFC with 18 starts in the last 19 games and 23 in 27 appearances this season. The veteran has played exactly 2,000 minutes on the season and his transition to the midfield has been one of the keys to NYCFC’s success this season.\n\nNYCFC has lost just one of the last nine games Iraola has started, including back-to-back wins over the Chicago Fire and Houston Dynamo.\n\n“I think we are also in good form and I think we can win this game,” Iraola said.\n\nBut Iraola knows that won’t be easy. While NYCFC can move a step closer to clinching one of the top two spots in the Eastern Conference, D.C. United is trying to secure one of the final three playoff spots in the East.\n\nAfter some early struggles, D.C. United has won three straight games and has just one loss in their last 12 games and is currently in fifth place, four points ahead of the playoff line.\n\n“Obviously it’s a huge game for us,” Iraola said. “They are a good team, they are probably one of the best teams right now. They’ve won three in a row, lost one in their last 12. They are in a very good form.”",
  "latent_25216": "Being injured is always a problem, but when it is not your fault, it becomes even more of a problem because you will want to have some settlement to help you get better and provide you with money from the injury. This is when you may think about suing the individual or company that caused your injury. This could be a mistake, though, and often if you are not properly represented end up with you losing your case. To avoid this, you should use some tips to help you in finding the best personal injury attorney to represent you in your case. Look For A Lawyer For Your Specific Claim Yes, there are lawyers out there who have a specialty in almost every type of case imaginable. Since this is the case, people need to make sure they are looking for a lawyer who is specific to their claim. For example, if the claim is involving Workers Compensation, then people will want to make sure they look for a lawyer who can properly represent them in this case. This way they can get the proper help for the case because the lawyer is familiar with the type of laws that can apply to the case they have.\n\nAsk To See Past Winnings While the client’s names cannot be provided because of legal and confidentiality reasons, people will want to know if the lawyer has won major cases in the past or not. The lawyers if they have won some bigger cases are more likely to provide the information that you requested compared to a lawyer who has not won any of the major cases in the past. When looking at these case winnings if possible find out what kind of injuries the case was stemming from and this can allow you to get a good idea on if the lawyer would be able to handle your court case properly or not.\n\nResearch The Internet Just like when you go out to buy a new car, you should do some research on the lawyer you are hiring. The Internet is very unforgiving when it comes to criticism, and this can be a major problem for a lot of people. So you need to make sure you are looking at the Internet to make sure you know about the lawyer and see what they have done in the past. This can be the good and the bad as some people will have great experiences with the lawyer’s offices, but other people will have some problems with the lawyer. By reading all the reviews and doing the proper research, it will make it easier for you to know if the lawyer will be able to handle your case or not.\n\nMeet With The Lawyer Face To Face Some of the lawyers will just skim the accident reports and send out representation questions for people to answer. This can be a major issue for a lot of people because they never actually meet with the lawyer face to face. By getting the chance to meet with the lawyer face to face, though, it will make it easier for people to know more about the lawyer and see his face. This way people can start to form their personal judgment about the lawyer and if they are going to be a good fit for the job or if they want to have a different lawyer representing them in the case they are getting ready to have issued.\n\nWhen people are hurt on the job, at someone’s house, or even in an auto accident, it is often considered a personal injury or workers compensation claim. Either way, people need to realize they are going to need to have some help in getting their case before a judge to help them get any settlement. To avoid these problems, you should know some tips to help you in finding a personal injury attorney. By using these tips, it will be easy for you to find a lawyer to represent you in your case and know that you will have a chance of getting a settlement from the court case, instead of losing the case.

I know it isn't necessary on the windows machines I've used, as the software actually looks for a card, checks for a specified value. I was just adding the info for those, like me, who have a small shop where they work with small projects, all using the older software versions. I max it out by using old hardware, but as fast as I can make it (I have a little fun playing computer frankenstein okay?), and it works pretty well for some pro-bono type work.

  "latent_25938": "Among 18 to 29-year-olds, 72 percent expressed that opinion. Among those aged 30 to 49, 59 percent said the same, while in the generation of 50- to 60-year-old people, 49 percent agreed with that view.\n\nThese are the results of a representative survey commissioned by Deutsche Welle (DW) and conducted by the public opinion research institute IFAK (Kiev). One thousand residents between ages 18 and 65 were interviewed by telephone in Russian cities with more than 50,000 residents.\n\nThe survey was conducted immediately after the EU-Russia summit in Yekaterinburg. That meeting was overshadowed by differences in opinion, particularly with respect to the conflict in Syria. Russian authorities' treatment of non-governmental organizations also caused political tensions between Brussels and Moscow. But such conflicts between Russia and the European Union do not appear to affect Russians' personal attitude toward the EU, as the survey reflects.\n\n41 percent of those polled said Russia should join the EU. Nearly one-third (30 percent) would like to see that step taken within the next five years. At the same time, 40 percent reject Russia’s accession to the European Union. Compared with the last DW-Trend survey in November 2012, these figures have hardly changed. That represents a halt to a negative trend seen in the last two years, when the percentage of people against EU accession rose from 18 percent in December 2010 to 41 percent in November 2012.\n\nThose surveyed have a positive view of the Russian-European relationship. Ten percent describe the relationship as friendly and 47 percent as cooperative. Just one in ten (11 percent) see the relations between Russia and European countries as strained.\n\nThe Russian-German relationship is viewed even more positively. Despite political conflicts that nearly led to an altercation during a meeting in late June between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin in St. Petersburg, 44 percent of Russians see German-Russian relations as cooperative, and 23 percent even see them as friendly. Only five percent describe the situation as tense.\n\nIn November 2012, 18 percent viewed the bilateral relations as tense or even hostile. As such, the German government's open and repeated criticism of restrictions on free speech and the human rights situation in Russia seems not to have had a long-term effect on the overall positive attitude of Russian citizens toward Germany and the European Union.",

  "latent_26175": "When news broke Sunday night that the Cleveland Indians had signed Mark Reynolds, there were two general categories into which Tribe fans’ reactions fell. The first camp (with whom I agree) liked the deal. While he’s an underwhelming first signing after the Shane Victorino and Nick Swisher rumors we heard during the Winter Meetings, Reynolds fills the Indians’ hole at first base while providing some sorely needed power from the right side for the reasonable price of one year and $6 million—not bad for Cleveland’s first big move of the winter.\n\nBut there was another group who held a more skeptical view. At the risk of oversimplifying the other side’s argument, the biggest objection I saw raised by those who opposed the Reynolds signing can be summed up in one word: strikeouts.\n\nYes, Mark Reynolds strikes out a lot. And I mean a lot. In 2008, he set a new MLB single-season record by seeing strike three 204 times. He then broke his own record a year later, fanning 223 times in 2009—it’s been only three years, but so far he still has the honor of having struck out more times in a single season than anyone else in MLB history. Since he first broke into The Show in 2007, he’s led the majors with 1,122 strikeouts and no one with at least 1,600 plate appearances has topped his 32.6% strikeout rate. There’s no way to deny that he gets punched out a ton.\n\nBut despite what conventional wisdom might tell you, strikeouts aren’t that bad—they’re only very slightly more damaging than batted ball outs, and some of the best hitters in the game see strike three quite often. Your 2012 MLB strikeout leaders were Adam Dunn and Curtis Granderson, both considered very good hitters; looking at K%, it’s Dunn and Pedro Alvarez, who started to come into his own this year. Heck, look at Jim Thome. He struck out almost 200 times in 2001, and no one ever questioned his ability to play first base in his heyday.\n\nJust looking at Reynolds’ résumé shows that his strikeouts are not a fatal flaw because they come with walks (his BB% rounded to 14% in two of his last three seasons) and power (he’s averaged 34 home runs per 162 games). Striking out by definition means losing an opportunity to reach base, but Reynolds’ Carlos Santana-like ability to walk helped him to a .335 on-base percentage last year—the same as Jason Kipnis‘—and his OBP has never fallen below .320.\n\nAccording to wRC+, a linear weights-based statistic that puts all batters on a scale based on runs created, Reynolds has been 9% better than the average MLB hitter in his career despite striking out in almost a third of his plate appearances. So while it will be incredibly frustrating to see him get fanned at least once a game in 2013, it won’t mean he’s a bad hitter.\n\nStrikeouts will always hamper Reynolds’ value—a player with his power would command a lot more than $6 million if he didn’t have some major flaw—but don’t be fooled by the panic about his tendency to swing and miss. So long as he keeps up the other two of the “three true outcomes” (walks and home runs) he’ll be a terrific addition to the Tribe’s lineup.\n\nHow would you grade the Mark Reynolds deal?

  "latent_26193": "Rushdoony and Theocratic Libertarians on Slavery Rachel Tabachnick Tue Jul 13, 2010 at 11:54:25 AM EST Today's Christian nationalists are working to recruit minorities with a revisionist history that demonizes liberals as the source of American racism. Simultaneously these same Christian nationalists justify slavery and glorify the Confederacy in the context of promoting biblical law. Following the fold is a list of quotes from Rushdoony's books and other Christian nationalist texts, provided as documentation to accompany Bruce Wilson's recent article on Glenn Beck's promotion of the worldview which teaches this treatment of the issue of slavery. When Rousas J. Rushdoony died in 2001, Gary North wrote on LewRockwell.com, \"Rushdoony's writings are the source of many of the core ideas of the New Christian Right, a voting bloc whose unforeseen arrival in American politics in 1980 caught the media by surprise.\" Rushdoony provided the intellectual foundations for much of the current war on separation of church and state, as well as the framework for understanding today's theocratic libertarians' paradoxical view of slavery and their fixation with the holiness of the Confederate States of America.\n\n(Lew Rockwell is the founder of the \"anti-state, pro-market\" Ludwig von Mises Institute, based in Auburn, Alabama, which melds cultural conservatism with Austrian School economics. He served as Ron Paul's congressional chief of staff from 1978 to 1982.) Rushdoony was the founder of Christian Reconstructionism and described as the father of the modern homeschooling movement. He was forthright in his teaching that the U.S. should be subject to Old Testament law in the most literal sense and mapped this out in his 800-plus page 1973 book Institutes of Biblical Law. He laid the groundwork for today's theocratic libertarianism, or the belief that the ultimate freedom and liberty will be found through the elimination of most of federal government and the uniform imposition of biblical law. In other words, replacing \"statism\" with Christian dominion would provide a utopian society in which federal regulatory systems and central government are not required. Think of it as a marriage between Ayn Rand's anti-religious, laissez-faire gospel of the free market with theocratic law. I described the timeline of the development of this ideology in my article Biblical Capitalism - The Sacralizing of Political and Economic Issues. Rushdoony's goal of imposition of biblical law on the U.S. did not neglect issues such as slavery, and he claimed that \"some people are by nature slaves and will always be.\" He argued that socialism tries to give the slave the benefits of freedom, and thus \"destroys both the free and the enslaved.\" In his article, Bruce Wilson references Wallbuilders, founded by David Barton, and Stephen K. McDowell, co-founder of The Providence Foundation. McDowell is co-author with Mark A. Beliles of America's Providential History, a popular Christian nationalist history textbook which quotes Rushdoony and several other Reconstructionist including Gary North, Gary DeMar, and David Chilton. America's Providential History begins on page one with the following statement, \"The goal of America's Providential History is to equip Christians to be able to introduce Biblical principles into the public affairs of America, and every nation in the world, and in so doing bring Godly change throughout the world. We will be learning how to establish a Biblical form (and power) of government in America and we will see how our present governmental structures must be changed.\" The Providence Foundation is now working in Asia, Africa, Europe, and Latin America. Barton is author of The Myth of Separation, and is currently featured on \"Glenn Beck's University\". (See Chris Rodda's weekly articles debunking Barton's revisionist history.) Barton is on the board of directors of the Providence Foundation and McDowell is on the board of directors of Wallbuilders. America's Providential History lists Wallbuilders as a resource and Wallbuilders uses resource material from the Providence Foundation. Despite McDowell's statement that he is not a Reconstructionist, America's Providential History quotes Rushdoony and other leading Reconstructionists and mirrors much of Rushdoony's ideology. McDowell starred on the DVD God's Law and Society produced to spark a \"neo-Puritan revival within the church\" and also featuring Rushdoony, George Grant, Howard Phillips, Gary DeMar, Jay Grimstead (Coalition on Revival), and Randall Terry. Bruce Wilson references McDowell's article addressing the subject of slavery on Barton's Wallbuilders site since 2003, which repeatedly quotes Rushdoony. Rushdoony taught that slavery was biblical as long as involuntary slavery was used solely as a punishment and voluntary slavery was by non-Christians only. Rushdoony believed that slavery in its most evil context is slavery to statism, welfare systems, socialism, the Federal Reserve, and the \"religion of humanity.\" His 1973 Institutes of Biblical Law describes his belief that Christians must \"subdue all things and all nations to Christ and His law-word.\" In order to justify tearing down the wall of separation of church and state, Christian nationalist historians work to legitimize their interpretation of Old Testament law as legally binding to Christians. This does not mean sourcing the bible as one of the foundations for today's secular law but using biblical law as a blueprint for governing, including guidelines for criminal and civil law. They are particularly concerned about economics, taxation, and property rights. For instance Beliles and McDowell's text teaches that property tax and inheritance tax are not biblical and that the only taxes biblically allowed are the head/poll tax and tithe. They criticize the 16th Amendment \"which gave us the progressive income tax, which is a non-biblical form of taxation that destroys personal property rights.\" The application of biblical law to modern America requires some serious logical contortions on the topic of slavery. Following are quotes about slavery, the Civil War, and civil rights, from Rushdoony and from Beliles and McDowell's text America's Providential History. Also see McDowell's article on slavery at Wallbuilders. Rushdoony Quotes\n\n\"The law here is humane and also unsentimental. It recognizes that some people are by nature slaves and will always be so. It both requires that they be dealt with in a godly manner and also that the slave recognize his position and accept it with grace. Socialism, on the contrary, tries to give the slave all the advantages of his security together with the benefits of freedom, and in the process, destroys bot the free and the enslaved. The old principle of law, derived from this law, that the welfare recipient cannot exercise the suffrage and related rights of a free citizen, is still valid.\n\n-Rushdoony, Institutes of Biblical Law, p. 251 Christians cannot become slaves voluntarily; they are not to become the slaves of men (I Cor 7:23), nor \"entangled again with the yoke of bondage\" (Gal. 5:2). The road of pseudo-security, of pseudo-liberation in slavery, socialism, and welfarism, is forbidden to the Christian.\"\n\n-Rushdoony, Institutes of Biblical Law, p.137 \"The purpose of freedom is that man exercise dominion and subdue the earth under God. A man who abuses his freedom to steal can be sold into slavery in order to work out his restitution (Ex. 22:3); if he cannot use his freedom for its true purpose, godly dominion, reconstruction, and restoration, he must then work towards restitution in his bondage.\n\n-Rushdoony, Institutes of Biblical Law, p. 485 In the following paragraphs, Rushdoony includes quotes from Benjamin M. Palmer, whom he describes as the greatest of Southern Presbyterian Calvinists: \"Indeed an important aspect of the Civil War was the Unitarian statist drive for an assault on its Calvinist enemy, the South... The gathering conflict (South Carolina had moved as early as November 16, 1860) Palmer saw as forces of a false theology, of atheism and of the French Revolution, of the religion of humanity, in short, arrayed against a Christian people dedicated to faith in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior and to Constitutional government. These forces sought to frame \"mischief by law.\" The South had slavery, the North had its growing and fearful problems of capital versus labor. Interference of one into the problems of the other could not be tolerated, because it would be destructive of the social order. Moreover, `In the imperfect state of human society, it please God to allow evils which check others that are greater.' The anti-Christian, Jacobin attack on slavery had to be fought and slavery defended, because the revolutionary reordering of society would be far worse than anything it sought to supplant. \"Human legislation\" was seeking to supplant God and to set \"bounds to what God can alone regulate.\" \"Last of all, in this great struggle, we defend the cause of God and religion. The abolition spirit is undeniably atheistic. The demon which erected its throne upon the guillotine in the days of Robespierre and Marat, which abolished the Sabbath and worshipped reason in the person a harlot, yet survives to work other horros, of which those of the French Revolution are but the type. Among a people so generally religious as the American, a disguise must be worn' but it si the smae old threadbare distuise of the advocacy of human rights.\"\n\n-Rushdoony, The Nature of the American System, pp. 58 - 59\n\n(The book credits the Howard Phillips family in its list of people who made the 2001 Ross House Books reprinting of the 1965 book possible.) \"The next great breech [against the Constitution] after the 11th Amendment came when Congress in 1862, by a legislative rather than a constitutional measure, abolished slavery in the territories. Lincoln, in abolishing slavery in the rebellious states, recognized the unconstitutionality of his step, but undertook it nevertheless. The 14th Amendment, illegally ratified, provided grounds for interference of the federal government in the jurisdiction of state governments. These implications of the 14th Amendment were progressively utilized by the Supreme Court shortly after the beginning of the twentieth century, and there began the court's recession from its conception of America as a Christian country and its development of a thesis of the unitary state. As the court embraced moral relativism as its religious principle, so it established national sovereignty and absolutism as a corollary to its denial of higher law.\"\n\n-Rushdoony, This Independent Republic, (1964, reprinted 2001) p. 34 \"During the Civil War, a Protestant thinker commented on the extent to which America had been subjected to anti-Christian pressures. These forces had been especially strong because of the political ties with France in the early years of the country's independence... Now,however, a special effort was again under way, as during the first twenty-five years of national existence, to undermine the Christian faith. This came from Unitarians, Universalists, and pantheistic, and other related groups.... The basic impetus was origin in Unitarian with European influences being channeled through that movement and its associated forces. It outgrew Unitarian boundaries and saw itself as \"free thought.\" Women's suffrage, feminism, the Negro vote as well as abolition, mesmerism, spiritualism, the peace movement, vegetarianism, socialism, repeal of usury laws, and other like movements were championed by these men... \"\n\n-Rushdoony, The Nature of the American System, p. 95 Note that in the following quotes the term \"religion of humanity\" is used by Rushdoony as a slur similar to the current use of \"secular humanists\" by the Religious Right. \"The Civil War was a triumph for the religion of humanity. Most churches, whatever their stand on slavery, opposed abolitionism and its social radicalism. As a result, in the North, these churches supported the war effort rather than demanding it. The Unitarian, Universalist, and transcendentalist champions of abolition were thus the real victors of the war.\"\n\n-Rushdoony, The Nature of the American System, p. 89 \"In the name of `civil rights,' some lots or homes can be sold to Negroes, and the courts increasingly further such action, which conforms to the religion of humanity, but a church can be denied the right of purchase in the name of planning.\"\n\n-Rushdoony, The Nature of the American System, p. 68 \"Minority groups, by means of the general ticket, hold balance of power in many states: the labor vote, Negroes, Catholics, Zionist Jews, pensioners, and the like... Only by restoring localism, by amending the Constitution to require the coincidence of the electoral college and its vote with the structure of Congress, can minority rule, with its attendant evils, hatred and injustice, be checked.\"\n\n-Rushdoony, The Nature of the American System, p. 19 \"Segregation or separation is thus a basic principle of Biblical law with respect to religion and morality. Every attempt to destroy this principle is an efffort to reduce society to its lowest common denominator. Toleration is the excuse under which this levelling is undertaken, but the concept of toleration conceals a radical intolerance. In the name of toleration, the believer is asked to associate on a common level of total acceptance with the atheist, the pervert, the criminal, and the adherents of other religions as though no differences existed.\"\n\n-Rushdoony, Institutes of Biblical Law, p. 294 \"In asking for these welfare subsidies, the Negroes are, it must be noted, asking for slavery, for welfarism is a form of slavery, and slavery is a form of welfarism. Welfarism is used to enslave peoples, and to break down the independence of the middle class by confiscatory taxation... In the culture of humanism, excellence must be destroyed to make way for the equality of degradation and failure.\n\n-Rushdoony, The Biblical Philosophy of History, p. 72 America's Providential History\n\nby Mark A. Beliles and Stephen K. McDowell, First edition 1989 \"Why was the North losing the battles? Because God induced the greatest generals to fight for the South.\"\n\n-p. 233 \"Lee did much to promote revival in his army and saw every soldier as a soul to be saved.\"\n\n-p. 233 The text describes the Confederate troops as an ongoing revival. \"During the winter of 1862 and 1863, while the Confederate army bivouacked along the Rappahannock, a religious revival swept the entire command. Jackson, [Gen. Stonewall Jackson] of course, enthusiastic, bent his energies toward facilitating the tide of Christian sentiment that bathed his army. He also strove to better organize the chaplains of the army, arguing they should meet together and through God's blessing devise successful plans for spiritual conquests. While the Confederate Army was enjoying revival (up to 150,000 troops were saved during the war), it also enjoyed phenomenal succes in almost every major battle. This induced Abraham Lincoln to seek God for the reasons why. He concluded that the nation's chief sins were slavery and pride.\"\n\n-pp. 234 - 235 The authors recognizes the abolition of slavery and the preservation of the Union as two positive aspects of the war. The negative aspects are described as follows: \"After the war an ungodly, radical Republican element gained control of Congress. They wanted to centralize power and shape the nation according to their philosophy. In order to do this, they had to remove the force of Calvinism in America, which was centered in the South at this time, and rid the South, which was opposed to centralization of its political power. They used their post-war control of Congress to reconstruct the South, pass the Fourteenth Amendment, and in many ways accomplish their goals. This explains the strong bias against the Republican Party in the South up to recent times.\"\n\n-p. 243 Stephen K. McDowell on Wallbuilders Website \"Personal and civil liberty is the result of applying the truth of the Scriptures. As a person or nation more fully applies the principles of Christianity, there will be increasing freedom in every realm of life.\" \"The law of Moses was given to fallen man. Some of the ordinances deal with things not intended for the original creation order, such as slavery and divorce. These will be eliminated completely only when sin is eliminated from the earth.\" This is just the tip of the iceberg, a sampling of an ideology that has been marketed to homeschoolers, private schools, and adult education programming for three decades. The existence of this theocratic libertarian movement is often overlooked, since it differs in significantly from the stereotype of the Religious Right. For example, the movement tends to be anti-war and critical of the neo-conservatives of the Bush administration, while strongly committed to social conservatism. Consider the similarities between theocratic libertarianism and segments of the Tea Party movement, which much of the press has described as a competing, and very different entity than the Religious Right. Despite the glorification of the Confederacy in the writings of Rushdoony and the text of Beliles and McDowell, the Christian nationalist movement is going to great lengths to appeal to African Americans. See this PFAW booklet on the issue, \"David Barton: Propaganda Masquerading as History.\" For a condensed version of the current talking points by Christian nationalists on why African Americans should flee from the oppressive and racist Democratic party, see an example from Peter Marshall Ministries website. Note that the \"Southern strategy\" realignment is conveniently left out of these histories. Peter Marshall and David Barton were both on the advisory board for the Texas School Board of Education during the recent controversial changes to the history curriculum guidelines, an example of the gradual movement of Christian nationalist ideology into public school curriculum. No crystal ball is required to know what is coming next. Take a look at America's Providential History and the writings of Rushdoony. Gary North, Rushdoony's son-in-law and prolific Reconstructionist writer, describes how theocratic libertarianism can be implemented. \"So let us be blunt about it - we must use the doctrine of religious liberty to gain independence for Christian schools until we train up a generation of people who know that there is no religious neutrality, no neutral law, no neutral education, and no neutral civil government. Then they will get busy constructing a Bible-based social, political and religious order which finally denies the religious liberty of the enemies of God. Murder, abortion, and pornography will be illegal. God's law will be enforced. It will take time. A minority religion cannot do this. Theocracy must flow from the hearts of a majority of citizens, just as compulsory education came only after most people had their children in schools of some sort. -Gary North in \"The Intellectual Schizophrenia of the New Christian Right\" from Symposium on the Failure of the American Baptist Culture, published by Geneva Divinity School and edited by James B.

He is the co-author of the \"Spiral Dynamics\" theory, an evolutionary human development model. He spent many years adapting the work of his mentor and colleague, developmental psychologist Clare W. Graves, Professor Emeritus in Psychology at Union College in New York.\n\nEducation and academia [ edit ]\n\nBeck received a B.A from Abilene Christian University in 1958 and his M.A in Theology and Communication from the same institution a year later in 1959. He was awarded his Ph.D. in Communication and Social Psychology with a focus on large scale systems dynamics and change in 1966 by the University of Oklahoma. His dissertation was on the psychological forces that produced the American Civil War.[citation needed]\n\nBeck has held academic positions at various institutions including the University of North Texas from 1961-1981, Adjunct Professor at Conoco Corporate University from 1998-1999, and Adizes Graduate School from 2000 to the present day.[1]\n\nResearch Instruments [ edit ]\n\nDon E. Beck has authored research instruments, including:\n\nThe Values Test (1986-2002, National Values Center)\n\nThe Change State Indicator [2] [3]\n\nThe Culture Scan [4]\n\nOnline PeopleSCAN.[5]\n\nSpiral Dynamics [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment of the theory [ edit ]\n\nDon Beck worked with Christopher Cowan to preserve the work of Clare W. Graves. In 1974, while working as a professor at Northern Texas University, Beck encountered an article by Graves in The Futurist and flew to New York to meet Graves. After two days of dialogues, Beck decided to record Graves' knowledge, as the latter's health was deteriorating.[6] Beck first met Graves in 1975 and worked with him closely until his death in 1986.\n\nGraves had published his theory[7] of human development in 1974, a \"bio-psycho-social systems\" framework of value systems as applied to human sociocultural evolution which posits that the psychology of the mature human being transitions from a current level of cultural existence based on current life conditions to a more complex level in response to (or to cope with) changes in existential reality. Graves's model demonstrates the dual nature of human social emergence with state changes between communal/collective value systems (sacrifice self) and individualistic (express self) value systems.\n\nAccording to the 1974 The Futurist biography of Graves, he began decades of experimentation and research in 1952. In The Futurist article, Graves classified a total of eight levels of increasingly complex human value systems consisting of a hierarchically ordered, always-open-to-change set of identifiable world views, preferences, and purposes.[8] Through these value systems, groups and cultures structure their societies and individuals integrate within them. Each distinct set of values is developed as a response to solving the problems of the previous system. Changes between states may occur incrementally (first order change) or in a sudden breakthrough (second order change).\n\nThe original 1974 publication, \"Human Nature Prepares for a Momentous Leap\" (The Futurist, pp. 72–87) defined the overall theory and the value systems within it. Each system may express a healthy or unhealthy manifestation of its values, as defined by Graves:\n\nThe First Tier systems were grouped by nature of their narrow perspective as \"subsistence levels\" (para. 4), each aligns with a specific world view that rejects the prior systems and seeks to preserve its own status quo. The differences between communal/collective and individualistic value systems, and the inability of First Tier systems to recognize the strengths or pathologies of other world views, helps to explain social conflict in the world today (para. 7).\n\nAccording to Graves, the move to Second Tier thinking requires a \"leap\" in perspective. At Second Tier - the first 'being level', society recognizes a responsibility for facilitating the health of each value system on First Tier. The goal is not expediting emergence but the result is, when healthy, each First Tier system will naturally progress toward Second Tier.\n\nFrom Graves' work, Beck and his colleague, Cristopher Cowan, developed the theory further and presented a structured evolutionary model of adaptive intelligence called Spiral Dynamics. Beck and Cowan first published their construct in Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership, and Change (Exploring the New Science of Memetics) (1996).[9] Spiral Dynamics theory spawned much discussion and (sometimes tangential) integration of concepts by other theorists, such as Ken Wilber.[10][11]\n\nInfluences [ edit ]\n\nGraves' original theory compared a number of psychological and behavioral constructs such as Max Weber, Abraham Maslow, and Jane Loevinger.[12] Beck and Cowan's Spiral Dynamics theory was influenced by three additional innovations:\n\nEvolutionary biologist Richard Dawkins proposed a model of cultural information transfer in which ideas (memes), such as patterns of behavior, habits and beliefs, proliferate in a way similar to biological genes, through humans as they connect with one another socially. Memetics explains the systemic spread of values in society as social DNA in Graves' specific evolutionary sequence.\n\nMuzafer Sherif, his wife Carolyn Sherif, and Carl Hovland's Assimilation Contrast Effect model [13] is grounded in social judgment theory.

Hall,[17] Chairman of South Africa's National Peace Committee, who referenced Beck's ongoing (15 years) work in a 1993 interview.[18]\n\nOn May 3, 1995, both houses of the Texas State Legislature (Beck's home state) adopted a resolution (S.R. No. 901) presented by the President of the Texas Senate which commends Beck \"for his invaluable contributions toward the peaceful creation of a democratic South Africa.\"[19]\n\nIn November 2012, Beck was invited as a key presenter for the University of Stellenbosch Business School Executive Development Event \"Africa Leads\".[20] According to the University program announcement, Beck's spiral dynamics \"informed the creation of the Peace Committees and subsequent CODESA process in the run up to the first post- apartheid elections in 1994.\"[citation needed]\n\nIsrael and Palestine [ edit ]\n\nBeck also presented Spiral Dynamics in Israel and Palestine,[21] holding meetings and trainings hosted in Israel,[22] speaking to the Arab Governor of Bethlehem, Salah Al Taamari; three members of the Palestinian Legislative Council and presenting to 40 city council members, government employees, and professors from Bethlehem University. In 2008 more than 700 Palestinians came to train in Spiral Dynamics theory with Beck and his colleague, Elza S.

For other uses, see Lavoisier (disambiguation)\n\nAntoine-Laurent de Lavoisier (also Antoine Lavoisier after the French Revolution; French: [ɑ̃twan lɔʁɑ̃ də lavwazje]; 26 August 1743 – 8 May 1794)[1] was a French nobleman and chemist who was central to the 18th-century chemical revolution and who had a large influence on both the history of chemistry and the history of biology.[2] He is widely considered in popular literature as the \"father of modern chemistry\".[3][4]\n\nIt is generally accepted that Lavoisier's great accomplishments in chemistry largely stem from his changing the science from a qualitative to a quantitative one. Lavoisier is most noted for his discovery of the role oxygen plays in combustion. He recognized and named oxygen (1778) and hydrogen (1783) and opposed the phlogiston theory. Lavoisier helped construct the metric system, wrote the first extensive list of elements, and helped to reform chemical nomenclature. He predicted the existence of silicon (1787)[5] and was also the first to establish that sulfur was an element (1777) rather than a compound.[6] He discovered that, although matter may change its form or shape, its mass always remains the same.\n\nLavoisier was a powerful member of a number of aristocratic councils, and an administrator of the Ferme générale. The Ferme générale was one of the most hated components of the Ancien Régime because of the profits it took at the expense of the state, the secrecy of the terms of its contracts, and the violence of its armed agents.[7] All of these political and economic activities enabled him to fund his scientific research. At the height of the French Revolution, he was charged with tax fraud and selling adulterated tobacco, and was guillotined.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life and education\n\nAntoine-Laurent Lavoisier was born to a wealthy family of the nobility in Paris on 26 August 1743. The son of an attorney at the Parliament of Paris, he inherited a large fortune at the age of five upon the death of his mother.[8] Lavoisier began his schooling at the Collège des Quatre-Nations, University of Paris (also known as the Collège Mazarin) in Paris in 1754 at the age of 11. In his last two years (1760–1761) at the school, his scientific interests were aroused, and he studied chemistry, botany, astronomy, and mathematics. In the philosophy class he came under the tutelage of Abbé Nicolas Louis de Lacaille, a distinguished mathematician and observational astronomer who imbued the young Lavoisier with an interest in meteorological observation, an enthusiasm which never left him. Lavoisier entered the school of law, where he received a bachelor's degree in 1763 and a licentiate in 1764. Lavoisier received a law degree and was admitted to the bar, but never practiced as a lawyer. However, he continued his scientific education in his spare time.\n\nEarly scientific work\n\nLavoisier's education was filled with the ideals of the French Enlightenment of the time, and he was fascinated by Pierre Macquer's dictionary of chemistry. He attended lectures in the natural sciences. Lavoisier's devotion and passion for chemistry were largely influenced by Étienne Condillac, a prominent French scholar of the 18th century. His first chemical publication appeared in 1764. From 1763 to 1767, he studied geology under Jean-Étienne Guettard. In collaboration with Guettard, Lavoisier worked on a geological survey of Alsace-Lorraine in June 1767. In 1764 he read his first paper to the French Academy of Sciences, France's most elite scientific society, on the chemical and physical properties of gypsum (hydrated calcium sulfate), and in 1766 he was awarded a gold medal by the King for an essay on the problems of urban street lighting. In 1768 Lavoisier received a provisional appointment to the Academy of Sciences.[9] In 1769, he worked on the first geological map of France.\n\nLavoisier as a social reformer\n\nResearch benefitting the public good\n\nWhile Lavoisier is commonly known for his contributions to the sciences, he also dedicated a significant portion of his fortune and work toward benefitting the public.[10][11][12][13] Lavoisier was a humanitarian—he cared deeply about the people in his country and often concerned himself with improving the livelihood of the population by agriculture, industry, and the sciences.[11] The first instance of this occurred in 1765, when he submitted an essay on improving urban street lighting to the French Academy of Sciences.[11][12][13]\n\nThree years later in 1768, he focused on a new project to design an aqueduct. The goal was to bring in water from the river Yvette into Paris so that the citizens could have clean drinking water. But, since the construction never commenced, he instead turned his focus to purifying the water from the Seine. This was the project that interested Lavoisier in the chemistry of water and public sanitation duties.[13]\n\nHe additionally was interested in air quality, and spent some time studying the health risks associated with gunpowder's effect on the air.[12] In 1772, he performed a study on how to reconstruct the Hôtel-Dieu hospital, after it had been damaged by fire, in a way that would allow proper ventilation and clean air throughout.[13]\n\nAt the time, the prisons in Paris were known to be largely unlivable and the prisoners’ treatment inhumane.[10] Lavoisier took part in investigations in 1780 (and again in 1791) on the hygiene in prisons and had made suggestions to improve living conditions, which were largely ignored.[10][13]\n\nOnce a part of the Academy, Lavoisier also held his own competitions to push the direction of research towards bettering the public and his own work.[12] One such project he proposed in 1793 was to better public health on the “insalubrious arts.”\n\nLavoisier had a vision of public education having roots in “scientific sociability” and philanthropy.[12]\n\nLavoisier gained a vast majority of his income through buying stock in the General Farm, which allowed him to work on science full-time, live comfortably, and allowed him to contribute financially to better the community.[13] (It would also contribute to his demise during the Reign of Terror many years later.[14])\n\nIt was very difficult to secure public funding for the sciences at the time, and additionally not very financially profitable for the average scientist, so Lavoisier used his wealth to open a very expensive and sophisticated laboratory in France so that aspiring scientists could study without the barriers of securing funding for their research.[10][13]\n\nHe also pushed for public education in the sciences. He founded two organizations, Lycée and Musée des Arts et Métiers, which were created to serve as educational tools for the public. Funded by the wealthy and noble, the Lycée regularly taught courses to the public beginning in 1793.[12]\n\nFerme générale and marriage\n\nAt the age of 26, around the time he was elected to the Academy of Sciences, Lavoisier bought a share in the Ferme générale, a tax farming financial company which advanced the estimated tax revenue to the royal government in return for the right to collect the taxes. On behalf of the Ferme générale Lavoisier commissioned the building of a wall around Paris so that customs duties could be collected from those transporting goods into and out of the city.[15] His participation in the collection of its taxes did not help his reputation when the Reign of Terror began in France, as taxes and poor government reform were the primary motivators during the French Revolution.\n\nLavoisier consolidated his social and economic position when, in 1771 at age 28, he married Marie-Anne Pierrette Paulze, the 13-year-old daughter of a senior member of the Ferme générale.[1] She was to play an important part in Lavoisier's scientific career—notably, she translated English documents for him, including Richard Kirwan's Essay on Phlogiston and Joseph Priestley's research. In addition, she assisted him in the laboratory and created many sketches and carved engravings of the laboratory instruments used by Lavoisier and his colleagues for their scientific works. Madame Lavoisier edited and published Antoine's memoirs (whether any English translations of those memoirs have survived is unknown as of today) and hosted parties at which eminent scientists discussed ideas and problems related to chemistry.[16]\n\nA portrait of Antoine and Marie-Anne Lavoisier was painted by the famed artist Jacques-Louis David. Completed in 1788 on the eve of the Revolution, the painting was denied a customary public display at the Paris Salon for fear that it might inflame anti-aristocratic passions.[17]\n\nFor 3 years following his entry into the Ferme générale, Lavoisier's scientific activity diminished somewhat, for much of his time was taken up with official Ferme générale business. He did, however, present one important memoir to the Academy of Sciences during this period, on the supposed conversion of water into earth by evaporation. By a very precise quantitative experiment Lavoisier showed that the \"earthy\" sediment produced after long-continued reflux heating of water in a glass vessel was not due to a conversion of the water into earth but rather to the gradual disintegration of the inside of the glass vessel produced by the boiling water. He also attempted to introduce reforms in the French monetary and taxation system to help the peasants.\n\nAdulteration of tobacco\n\nThe Farmers General held a monopoly of the production, import and sale of tobacco in France, and the taxes they levied on tobacco brought revenues of 30 million livres a year. However this revenue began to fall because of a growing black market in tobacco that was smuggled and adulterated, most commonly with ash and water. Lavoisier devised a method of checking whether ash had been mixed in with tobacco: \"When a spirit of vitriol, aqua fortis or some other acid solution is poured on ash, there is an immediate very intense effervescent reaction, accompanied by an easily detected noise.\" Lavoisier also noticed that the addition of a small amount of ash improved the flavour of tobacco. Of one vendor selling adulterated goods he wrote \"His tobacco enjoys a very good reputation in the province... the very small proportion of ash that is added gives it a particularly pungent flavour that consumers look for. Perhaps the Farm could gain some advantage by adding a bit of this liquid mixture when the tobacco is fabricated.\" Lavoisier also found that while adding a lot of water to bulk the tobacco up would cause it to ferment and smell bad, the addition of a very small amount improved the product. Thereafter the factories of the Farmers General added, as he recommended, a consistent 6.3% of water by volume to the tobacco they processed.[18] To allow for this addition, the Farmers General delivered to retailers seventeen ounces of tobacco while only charging for sixteen.[19] To ensure that only these authorised amounts were added, and to exclude the black market, Lavoisier saw to it that a watertight system of checks, accounts, supervision and testing made it very difficult for retailers to source contraband tobacco or to improve their profits by bulking it up. He was energetic and rigorous in implementing this, and the systems he introduced were deeply unpopular with the tobacco retailers across the country. This unpopularity was to have consequences for him during the French Revolution.[20]\n\nRoyal Commission on Agriculture\n\nLavoisier urged the establishment of a Royal Commission on Agriculture. He then served as its Secretary and spent considerable sums of his own money in order to improve the agricultural yields in the Sologne, an area where farmland was of poor quality. The humidity of the region often led to a blight of the rye harvest, causing outbreaks of ergotism among the population. In 1788 Lavoisier presented a report to the Commission detailing ten years of efforts on his experimental farm to introduce new crops and types of livestock. His conclusion was that despite the possibilities of agricultural reforms, the tax system left tenant farmers with so little that it was unrealistic to expect them to change their traditional practices.[21]\n\nGunpowder Commission\n\nLavoisier's researches on combustion were carried out in the midst of a very busy schedule of public and private duties, especially in connection with the Ferme Générale. There were also innumerable reports for and committees of the Academy of Sciences to investigate specific problems on order of the royal government. Lavoisier, whose organizing skills were outstanding, frequently landed the task of writing up such official reports. In 1775 he was made one of four commissioners of gunpowder appointed to replace a private company, similar to the Ferme générale, which had proved unsatisfactory in supplying France with its munitions requirements. As a result of his efforts, both the quantity and quality of French gunpowder greatly improved, and it became a source of revenue for the government. His appointment to the Gunpowder Commission brought one great benefit to Lavoisier's scientific career as well. As a commissioner, he enjoyed both a house and a laboratory in the Royal Arsenal. Here he lived and worked between 1775 and 1792.\n\nLavoisier was a formative influence in the formation of the Du Pont gunpowder business because he trained Éleuthère Irénée du Pont, its founder, on gunpowder making in France; the latter said that the Du Pont gunpowder mills \"would never have been started but for his kindness to me.\"[22]:40\n\nDuring the Revolution\n\nIn June 1791 Lavoisier made a loan of 71,000 livres to Pierre Samuel du Pont de Nemours to buy a printing works so that du Pont could publish a newspaper, La Correspondance Patriotique. The plan was for this to include both reports of debates in the National Constituent Assembly as well as papers from the Academy of Sciences.[23] The revolution quickly disrupted the elder du Pont's first newspaper, but his son E.I. du Pont soon launched Le Republicain and published Lavoisier's latest chemistry texts.[22]:15 Lavoisier also chaired the commission set up to establish a uniform system of weights and measures[24][25] which in March 1791[26] recommended the adoption of the metric system. The new system of weights and measures was adopted by the Convention on 1 August 1793.[27] Lavoisier himself was removed from the commission on weights and measures on 23 December 1793, together with Laplace and several other members, for political reasons.[25] One of his last major works was a proposal to the National Convention for the reform of French education. He also intervened on behalf of a number of foreign-born scientists including mathematician Joseph Louis Lagrange, which helped to exempt them from a mandate stripping all foreigners of possessions and freedom.[28]\n\nFinal days and execution\n\nAs the French Revolution gained momentum, attacks mounted on the deeply unpopular Ferme Générale, and it was eventually abolished in March 1791.[29] In 1792 Lavoisier was forced to resign from his post on the Gunpowder Commission and to move from his house and laboratory at the Royal Arsenal. On 8 August 1793, all the learned societies, including the Academy of Sciences, were suppressed at the request of Abbé Grégoire.[27]\n\nOn 24 November 1793, the arrest of all the former tax farmers was ordered. Lavoisier and the other Farmers General faced nine accusations of defrauding the state of money owed to it, and of adding water to tobacco before selling it. Lavoisier drafted their defence, refuting the financial accusations, reminding the court of how they had maintained a consistently high quality of tobacco. The court was however inclined to believe that by condemning them and seizing their goods, it would recover huge sums for the state.[19] Lavoisier was convicted and guillotined on 8 May 1794 in Paris, at the age of 50, along with his 27 co-defendants.[30]\n\nAccording to a (probably apocryphal) story, the appeal to spare his life so that he could continue his experiments was cut short by the judge, Coffinhal: \"La République n'a pas besoin de savants ni de chimistes; le cours de la justice ne peut être suspendu.\" (\"The Republic has no need of scientists or chemists; the course of justice cannot be delayed.\")[31][32] Lavoisier was convicted with summary justice of having plundered the people and the treasury of France, of having adulterated the nation's tobacco with water, and of having supplied the enemies of France with huge sums of money from the national treasury.\n\nLavoisier's importance to science was expressed by Lagrange who lamented the beheading by saying: \"Il ne leur a fallu qu’un moment pour faire tomber cette tête, et cent années peut-être ne suffiront pas pour en reproduire une semblable.\" (\"It took them only an instant to cut off this head, and one hundred years might not suffice to reproduce its like.\")[33][34]\n\nPost-mortem\n\nA year and a half after his death, Lavoisier was exonerated by the French government. During the White Terror, his belongings were delivered to his widow. A brief note was included, reading \"To the widow of Lavoisier, who was falsely convicted\".[35]\n\nAbout a century after his death, a statue of Lavoisier was erected in Paris. It was later discovered that the sculptor had not actually copied Lavoisier's head for the statue, but used a spare head of the Marquis de Condorcet, the Secretary of the Academy of Sciences during Lavoisier's last years.[citation needed] Lack of money prevented alterations from being made. The statue was melted down during the Second World War and has not been replaced. However, one of the main \"lycées\" (high schools) in Paris and a street in the 8th arrondissement are named after Lavoisier, and statues of him are found on the Hôtel de Ville and on the façade of the Cour Napoléon of the Louvre. His name is one of the 72 names of eminent French scientists, engineers and mathematicians inscribed on the Eiffel Tower as well as on buildings around Killian Court at MIT in Cambridge, MA.\n\nContributions to chemistry\n\nOxygen theory of combustion\n\nTraité élémentaire de chimie (Elementary treatise on chemistry) Antoine Lavoisier's phlogiston experiment. Engraving by Mme Lavoisier in the 1780s taken from(Elementary treatise on chemistry)\n\nDuring late 1772 Lavoisier turned his attention to the phenomenon of combustion, the topic on which he was to make his most significant contribution to science. He reported the results of his first experiments on combustion in a note to the Academy on 20 October, in which he reported that when phosphorus burned, it combined with a large quantity of air to produce acid spirit of phosphorus, and that the phosphorus increased in weight on burning. In a second sealed note deposited with the Academy a few weeks later (1 November) Lavoisier extended his observations and conclusions to the burning of sulfur and went on to add that \"what is observed in the combustion of sulfur and phosphorus may well take place in the case of all substances that gain in weight by combustion and calcination: and I am persuaded that the increase in weight of metallic calces is due to the same cause.\"\n\nJoseph Black's \"fixed air\"\n\nDuring 1773 Lavoisier determined to review thoroughly the literature on air, particularly \"fixed air,\" and to repeat many of the experiments of other workers in the field. He published an account of this review in 1774 in a book entitled Opuscules physiques et chimiques (Physical and Chemical Essays). In the course of this review he made his first full study of the work of Joseph Black, the Scottish chemist who had carried out a series of classic quantitative experiments on the mild and caustic alkalies. Black had shown that the difference between a mild alkali, for example, chalk (CaCO 3 ), and the caustic form, for example, quicklime (CaO), lay in the fact that the former contained \"fixed air,\" not common air fixed in the chalk, but a distinct chemical species, now understood to be carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), which was a constituent of the atmosphere. Lavoisier recognized that Black's fixed air was identical with the air evolved when metal calces were reduced with charcoal and even suggested that the air which combined with metals on calcination and increased the weight might be Black's fixed air, that is, CO 2 .\n\nJoseph Priestley\n\nIn the spring of 1774 Lavoisier carried out experiments on the calcination of tin and lead in sealed vessels which conclusively confirmed that the increase in weight of metals in combustion was due to combination with air. But the question remained about whether it was combination with common atmospheric air or with only a part of atmospheric air. In October the English chemist Joseph Priestley visited Paris, where he met Lavoisier and told him of the air which he had produced by heating the red calx of mercury with a burning glass and which had supported combustion with extreme vigor. Priestley at this time was unsure of the nature of this gas, but he felt that it was an especially pure form of common air. Lavoisier carried out his own researches on this peculiar substance. The result was his memoir On the Nature of the Principle Which Combines with Metals during Their Calcination and Increases Their Weight, read to the Academy on 26 April 1775 (commonly referred to as the Easter Memoir). In the original memoir Lavoisier showed that the mercury calx was a true metallic calx in that it could be reduced with charcoal, giving off Black's fixed air in the process.[36] When reduced without charcoal, it gave off an air which supported respiration and combustion in an enhanced way. He concluded that this was just a pure form of common air, and that it was the air itself \"undivided, without alteration, without decomposition\" which combined with metals on calcination.\n\nAfter returning from Paris, Priestley took up once again his investigation of the air from mercury calx. His results now showed that this air was not just an especially pure form of common air but was \"five or six times better than common air, for the purpose of respiration, inflammation, and ... every other use of common air.\" He called the air dephlogisticated air, as he thought it was common air deprived of its phlogiston. Since it was therefore in a state to absorb a much greater quantity of phlogiston given off by burning bodies and respiring animals, the greatly enhanced combustion of substances and the greater ease of breathing in this air were explained.\n\nPioneer of stoichiometry\n\nLavoisier's researches included some of the first truly quantitative chemical experiments. He carefully weighed the reactants and products of a chemical reaction in a sealed glass vessel so that no gases could escape, which was a crucial step in the advancement of chemistry.[37] In 1774, he showed that, although matter can change its state in a chemical reaction, the total mass of matter is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical change. Thus, for instance, if a piece of wood is burned to ashes, the total mass remains unchanged if gaseous reactants and products are included. Lavoisier's experiments supported the law of conservation of mass. In France it is taught as Lavoisier's Law and is paraphrased from a statement in his \"Traité Élémentaire de Chimie\" to \"Rien ne se perd, rien ne se crée, tout se transforme.\" (\"Nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is transformed.\"). Mikhail Lomonosov (1711–1765) had previously expressed similar ideas in 1748 and proved them in experiments; others whose ideas pre-date the work of Lavoisier include Jean Rey (1583–1645), Joseph Black (1728–1799), and Henry Cavendish (1731–1810). (See An Historical Note on the Conservation of Mass)\n\nChemical nomenclature\n\nLavoisier, together with Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude-Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François de Fourcroy, submitted a new program for the reforms of chemical nomenclature to the Academy in 1787, for there was virtually no rational system of chemical nomenclature at this time. This work, titled Méthode de nomenclature chimique (Method of Chemical Nomenclature, 1787), introduced a new system which was tied inextricably to Lavoisier's new oxygen theory of chemistry.[38] The Classical elements of earth, air, fire, and water were discarded, and instead some 55 substances which could not be decomposed into simpler substances by any known chemical means were provisionally listed as elements. The elements included light; caloric (matter of heat); the principles of oxygen, hydrogen, and azote (nitrogen); carbon; sulfur; phosphorus; the yet unknown \"radicals\" of muriatic acid (hydrochloric acid), boric acid, and \"fluoric\" acid; 17 metals; 5 earths (mainly oxides of yet unknown metals such as magnesia, barite, and strontia); three alkalies (potash, soda, and ammonia); and the \"radicals\" of 19 organic acids. The acids, regarded in the new system as compounds of various elements with oxygen, were given names which indicated the element involved together with the degree of oxygenation of that element, for example sulfuric and sulfurous acids, phosphoric and phosphorous acids, nitric and nitrous acids, the \"ic\" termination indicating acids with a higher proportion of oxygen than those with the \"ous\" ending. Similarly, salts of the \"ic\" acids were given the terminal letters \"ate,\" as in copper sulfate, whereas the salts of the \"ous\" acids terminated with the suffix \"ite,\" as in copper sulfite. The total effect of the new nomenclature can be gauged by comparing the new name \"copper sulfate\" with the old term \"vitriol of Venus.\" Lavoisier's new nomenclature spread throughout Europe and to the United States and became common use in the field of chemistry. This marked the beginning of the anti-phlogistic approach to the field.\n\nChemical revolution and opposition\n\nAntoine Lavoisier is commonly cited as a central contributor to the chemical revolution. His precise measurements and meticulous keeping of balance sheets throughout his experiment were vital to the wide spread acceptance of the law of conservation of mass. His introduction of new terminology, a binomial system modeled after that of Linnaeus, also helps to mark the dramatic changes in the field which are referred to generally as the chemical revolution. However, Lavoisier encountered much opposition in trying to change the field, especially from British phlogistic scientists. Joseph Priestley, Richard Kirwan, James Keir, and William Nicholson, among others, argued that quantification of substances did not imply conservation of mass.[39] Rather than reporting factual evidence, opposition claimed Lavoisier was misinterpreting the implications of his research. One of Lavoisier's allies, Jean Baptiste Biot, wrote of Lavoisier's methodology, \"one felt the necessity of linking accuracy in experiments to rigor of reasoning.\"[39] His opposition, however, argued that precision in experimentation did not imply precision in inferences and reasoning. Despite opposition, Lavoisier continued to use precise instrumentation to convince other chemists of his conclusions, often results to five to eight decimal places. Nicholson, who estimated that only three of these decimal places were meaningful, stated:\n\nIf it be denied that these results are pretended to be true in the last figures, I must beg leave to observe, that these long rows of figures, which in some instances extend to a thousand times the nicety of experiment, serve only to exhibit a parade which true science has no need of: and, more than this, that when the real degree of accuracy in experiments is thus hidden from our contemplation, we are somewhat disposed to doubt whether the exactitude scrupuleuse of the experiments be indeed such as to render the proofs de l'ordre demonstratif.[40]\n\nNotable works\n\nEaster memoir\n\nAntoine Lavoisier portrait\n\nThe \"official\" version of Lavoisier's Easter Memoir appeared in 1778. In the intervening period Lavoisier had ample time to repeat some of Priestley's latest experiments and perform some new ones of his own. In addition to studying Priestley's dephlogisticated air, he studied more thoroughly the residual air after metals had been calcined. He showed that this residual air supported neither combustion nor respiration and that approximately five volumes of this air added to one volume of the dephlogisticated air gave common atmospheric air. Common air was then a mixture of two distinct chemical species with quite different properties. Thus when the revised version of the Easter Memoir was published in 1778, Lavoisier no longer stated that the principle which combined with metals on calcination was just common air but \"nothing else than the healthiest and purest part of the air\" or the \"eminently respirable part of the air\". The same year he coined the name oxygen for this constituent of the air, from the Greek words meaning \"acid former\".[36][41] He was struck by the fact that the combustion products of such nonmetals as sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and nitrogen were acidic. He held that all acids contained oxygen and that oxygen was therefore the acidifying principle.\n\nDismantling phlogiston theory\n\nLavoisier's chemical research between 1772 and 1778 was largely concerned with developing his own new theory of combustion. In 1783 he read to the academy his paper entitled Réflexions sur le phlogistique (Reflections on Phlogiston), a full-scale attack on the current phlogiston theory of combustion. That year Lavoisier also began a series of experiments on the composition of water which were to prove an important capstone to his combustion theory and win many converts to it. Many investigators had been experimenting with the combination of Henry Cavendish's inflammable air, which Lavoisier termed hydrogen (Greek for \"water-former\"), with dephlogisticated air (oxygen) by electrically sparking mixtures of the gases. All of the researchers noted the production of water, but all interpreted the reaction in varying ways within the framework of the phlogiston theory. In cooperation with mathematician Pierre Simon de Laplace, Lavoisier synthesized water by burning jets of hydrogen and oxygen in a bell jar over mercury. The quantitative results were good enough to support the contention that water was not an element, as had been thought for over 2,000 years, but a compound of two gases, hydrogen and oxygen. The interpretation of water as a compound explained the inflammable air generated from dissolving metals in acids (hydrogen produced when water decomposes) and the reduction of calces by inflammable air (combination of gas from calx with oxygen to form water).[39]\n\nDespite these experiments, Lavoisier's antiphlogistic approach remained unaccepted by many other chemists. Lavoisier labored to provide definitive proof of the composition of water, attempting to use this in support of his theory. Working with Jean-Baptiste Meusnier, Lavoisier passed water through a red-hot iron gun barrel, allowing the oxygen to form an oxide with the iron and the hydrogen to emerge from the end of the pipe. He submitted his findings of the composition of water to the Académie des Sciences in April 1784, reporting his figures to eight decimal places.[39] Opposition responded to this further experimentation by stating that Lavoisier continued to draw the incorrect conclusions, and that his experiment demonstrated the displacement of phlogiston from iron by the combination of water with the metal. Lavoisier developed a new apparatus which utilized a pneumatic trough, a set of balances, a thermometer, and a barometer, all calibrated carefully. Thirty savants were invited to witness the decomposition and synthesis of water using this apparatus, convincing many who attended of the correctness of Lavoisier's theories. This demonstration established water as a compound of oxygen and hydrogen with great certainty for those who viewed it. The dissemination of the experiment, however, proved subpar, as it lacked the details to properly display the amount of precision taken in the measurements. The paper ended with a hasty statement that the experiment was \"more than sufficient to lay hold of the certainty of the proposition\" of the composition of water and stated that the methods used in the experiment would unite chemistry with the other physical sciences and advance discoveries.[42]\n\nElementary Treatise of Chemistry\n\nLavoisier employed the new nomenclature in his Traité élémentaire de chimie (Elementary Treatise on Chemistry), published in 1789. This work represents the synthesis of Lavoisier's contribution to chemistry and can be considered the first modern textbook on the subject. The core of the work was the oxygen theory, and the work became a most effective vehicle for the transmission of the new doctrines. It presented a unified view of new theories of chemistry, contained a clear statement of the law of conservation of mass, and denied the existence of phlogiston. This text clarified the concept of an element as a substance that could not be broken down by any known method of chemical analysis, and presented Lavoisier's theory of the formation of chemical compounds from elements. It remains a classic in the history of science. While many leading chemists of the time refused to accept Lavoisier's new ideas, demand for Traité élémentaire as a textbook in Edinburgh was sufficient to merit translation into English within about a year of its French publication.[43] In any event, the Traité élémentaire was sufficiently sound to convince the next generation.\n\nLavoisier conducting an experiment on respiration in the 1770s\n\nPhysiological work\n\nLavoisier (wearing goggles) operates his solar furnace to prevent contamination from combustion products\n\nThe relationship between combustion and respiration had long been recognized from the essential role which air played in both processes. Lavoisier was almost obliged, therefore, to extend his new theory of combustion to include the area of respiration physiology. His first memoirs on this topic were read to the Academy of Sciences in 1777, but his most significant contribution to this field was made in the winter of 1782/1783 in association with Laplace. The result of this work was published in a memoir, \"On Heat.\" Lavoisier and Laplace designed an ice calorimeter apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. The outer shell of the calorimeter was packed with snow, which melted to maintain a constant temperature of 0 °C around an inner shell filled with ice. By measuring the quantity of carbon dioxide and heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus, and by comparing the amount of heat produced when sufficient carbon was burned in the ice calorimeter to produce the same amount of carbon dioxide as that which the guinea pig exhaled, they concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. Lavoisier stated, \"la respiration est donc une combustion,\" that is, respiratory gas exchange is a combustion, like that of a candle burning.[44]\n\nThis continuous slow combustion, which they supposed took place in the lungs, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat. Lavoisier continued these respiration experiments in 1789–1790 in cooperation with Armand Seguin. They designed an ambitious set of experiments to study the whole process of body metabolism and respiration using Seguin as a human guinea pig in the experiments. Their work was only partially completed and published because of the disruption of the Revolution; but Lavoisier's pioneering work in this field served to inspire similar research on physiological processes for generations to come.\n\nLegacy\n\nSeimi Kaisō The work of Lavoisier was translated in Japan in the 1840s, through the process of Rangaku . Page from Udagawa Yōan 's 1840\n\nLavoisier's fundamental contributions to chemistry were a result of a conscious effort to fit all experiments into the framework of a single theory. He established the consistent use of the chemical balance, used oxygen to overthrow the phlogiston theory, and developed a new system of chemical nomenclature which held that oxygen was an essential constituent of all acids (which later turned out to be erroneous).\n\nLavoisier also did early research in physical chemistry and thermodynamics in joint experiments with Laplace. They used a calorimeter to estimate the heat evolved per unit of carbon dioxide produced, eventually finding the same ratio for a flame and animals, indicating that animals produced energy by a type of combustion reaction.\n\nLavoisier also contributed to early ideas on composition and chemical changes by stating the radical theory, believing that radicals, which function as a single group in a chemical process, combine with oxygen in reactions. He also introduced the possibility of allotropy in chemical elements when he discovered that diamond is a crystalline form of carbon.\n\nHe was also responsible for the construction of the gasometer, an expensive instrument he used at his demonstrations. While he used his gasometer exclusively for these, he also created smaller, cheaper, more practical gasometers that worked with a sufficient degree of precision that more chemists could recreate.[45]\n\nHe was essentially a theorist, and his great merit lay in his capacity to take over experimental work that others had carried out—without always adequately recognizing their claims—and by a rigorous logical procedure, reinforced by his own quantitative experiments, expounding the true explanation of the results.[citation needed] He completed the work of Black, Priestley and Cavendish, and gave a correct explanation of their experiments.\n\nOverall, his contributions are considered the most important in advancing chemistry to the level reached in physics and mathematics during the 18th century.[46]\n\nAwards and honours\n\nDuring his lifetime, Lavoisier was awarded a gold medal by the King of France for his work on urban street lighting (1766), and was appointed to the French Academy of Sciences (1768).[9]\n\nLavoisier's work was recognized as an International Historic Chemical Landmark by the American Chemical Society, Académie des sciences de L'institut de France and the Société Chimique de France in 1999.[47] Antoine Laurent Lavoisier's Louis 1788 publication entitled Méthode de Nomenclature Chimique, published with colleagues Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, Claude Louis Berthollet, and Antoine François, comte de Fourcroy,[48] was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society, presented at the Académie des Sciences (Paris) in 2015.[49][50]\n\nA number of Lavoisier Medals have been named and given in Lavoisier's honour, by organizations including the Société chimique de France, the International Society for Biological Calorimetry, and the DuPont company.[citation needed]\n\nSelected writings\n\nIn translation\n\n\"Experiments on the Respiration of Animals, and on the Changes effected on the Air in passing through their Lungs.\" (Read to the Académie des Sciences, 3 May 1777) \"On the Combustion of Candles in Atmospheric Air and in Dephlogistated Air.\" (Communicated to the Académie des Sciences, 1777) \"On the Combustion of Kunckel's Phosphorus.\" \"On the Existence of Air in the Nitrous Acid, and on the Means of decomposing and recomposing that Acid.\" \"On the Solution of Mercury in Vitriolic Acid.\" \"Experiments on the Combustion of Alum with Phlogistic Substances, and on the Changes effected on Air in which the Pyrophorus was burned.\" \"On the Vitriolisation of Martial Pyrites.\" \"General Considerations on the Nature of Acids, and on the Principles of which they are composed.\" \"On the Combination of the Matter of Fire with Evaporable Fluids; and on the Formation of Elastic Aëriform Fluids.\"\n\n“Reflections on Phlogiston”, translation by Nicholas W.

  "latent_26386": "Modern societies rely entirely on big intermediaries, such as banks, to establish trust in their economies. Overall, they have done a good job fulfilling their function. However, there are problems that stem from old business models clashing with new technology. Inherent to the old model is centralization, which is buckling under its own weight.\n\nIn 2009, Bitcoin was anonymously released in the wake of one of the largest financial shocks in history. It is a digital cryptocurrency that is not regulated or issued by any government or private entity.\n\nAlthough it has very little intrinsic value and was originally worth pennies on the dollar, there is major interest in its underlying blockchain technology due to its decentralized and pseudonymous nature.\n\nBitcoin can be purchased through an online exchange using traditional currency, either whole or in fractions.\n\nA digital wallet is needed in order to safely store the Bitcoin due to the possibility of online exchanges being hacked. Private wallets allow users to store Bitcoin and safely create backups on a smartphone or offline.\n\nBitcoin was the world’s strongest currency in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, outperforming even gold. In 2014 it was the world’s worst performing currency.\n\nThe upward trend continued in 2015 and 2016. It is currently priced within $700 per Bitcoin, well below its 2013 peak of over $1,200.\n\nWatch On Forbes: Blockchain And The Evolution of Money\n\nBitcoin’s purpose is to establish trust and allow transactions across a global ledger, specifically with no need for a third party. Trust is created through peer-to-peer collaboration and cryptography rather than a singular authority figure. Every transaction is shared across millions of computers.\n\nBlocks are calculated and mined every 10 minutes with an updated list of transactions. These are linked together to form a chain of time-stamped blocks that represent the whole history of the blockchain. This is a clever tactic against hackers, who would have to compromise every computer on the blockchain using high levels of cryptography while everyone is watching.\n\nBitcoin “miners” contribute their computational resources in order to make the system work. In exchange, they receive some Bitcoin. The blocks increase in complexity and halve their size on a scheduled basis. This disinflationary process increases the amount of energy needed to complete future calculations.\n\nMany individuals have pooled their resources together and contribute to a framework that allows new privacy tools such as Bitcoin to be open to criticism, which is needed for innovation. It is this global network of developers continually making adjustments and improvements to Bitcoin’s functionality.\n\nIt is important to note the lack of confidentiality when it comes to Bitcoin, even though real identities aren’t attached to any blockchain. It is not entirely anonymous, although attempts to make it more private are currently being developed by an energetic community. Addresses can still be linked to other transactions.\n\nBy residing entirely on the public domain, there is no point of authority that a government can bully and coerce into submission using laws like FISA and looming threats of prosecution.\n\nBitcoin has therefore been unfairly branded through illegal activities such as hacking and portrayed as anti-government, but these labels are missing the most basic point, which is that it enables people to be in full control of their own financial activity.\n\n“While modern networks have made it easier to use aged financial infrastructure, particularly in a digital context, they have not created new infrastructure,” writes Spencer Bogart, the author of a Sept. 22 report from Needham & Company, an investment banking and asset management firm.\n\n“Bitcoin, on the other hand, is new infrastructure for digital value exchange,” Bogart writes.\n\nRead Forbes' eBook \"Secret Money: Living On Bitcoin In The Real World.\"\n\n“The price of Bitcoin benefits from two main sources of demand: its value as a ‘digital gold’ and its utility as a payments channel.”\n\nThe investment report also shows that Bitcoin liquidity has steadily grown as its volatility has declined. Its daily price volatility is now comparable to oil and it has even fallen below that of popular Internet IPOs.\n\nEmerging markets from developing countries have been particularly fond of Bitcoin due to a combination of unstable currencies and more financial crises.\n\nCapital controls and excessive costs for cross-border transactions also make Bitcoin more appealing as a fast and low-cost alternative.\n\nRemittance plays a big factor in Bitcoin’s popularity abroad. It is costly and time consuming for immigrants to send money across borders. A borderless currency such as Bitcoin allows distant families to access funds within mere minutes using only a 2% transaction fee instead of the 10-20% banks generally charge.\n\nThere are many recurring problems with centralization planning around the world. Working-class votes for Brexit and Trump are a symptom of this. However, it is not simply limited to the United States or Europe.\n\nThe past weeks have seen India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi defend his unexpected demonetization effort that began on Nov. 8, causing tremendous disruptions throughout the Indian economy.\n\nAccording to Reuters, “nearly half of India’s 202,000 ATMs were shut on Friday,” after the announcement withdrawing 500 and 1,000-rupee notes. Over 80% of the currency in circulation has effectively been banned.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people waited outside their banks as “anger intensified” across India. Accounts in Mumbai described prices jumping by a factor of ten in return for accepting the old cash notes.\n\nMeanwhile, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley is quoted in Bloomberg as calmly stating that “there are long, but orderly queues” at the banks.\n\n“A big regret is that people are getting inconvenienced,”Jaitley said. It is a vastly different perspective from the countless images of disorder on the streets.\n\nAccording to a Credit Suisse report on Securities Research & Analytics from June of this year, “As data becomes the new currency, financial institutions will be willing to forego transaction fees to get rich digital information on their customers.”\n\n“The elimination of these fees will further accelerate the move to a cashless economy as merchant payments will also become digital.”\n\nCredit Suisse also estimates that at least 90% of Indian consumer purchases are made in cash.\n\n\"We can gradually move from a less-cash society to a cashless society,\" said Modi during his most recent speach on national radio.\n\nHe encouraged daily wage earners by saying, \"This is the chance for you to enter the digital world.\"\n\nHe spoke in Hindi, urging them to use mobile banking apps and credit cards. Modi also pushed young people to teach others how to use digital payments.\n\nThe Indian government has publicly declared its larger concerns regarding tax evasion and the black market. These sentiments can be seen overseas, as well.\n\nUBS analyst Jonathan Mott believes Australia needs to follow India’s example by eliminating Australia’s $100 and $50 bills.\n\nAccording to a note he sent to his clients earlier this month, demonetization would be “good for the economy and good for the banks.”\n\nHe cites potential benefits as reductions in crime and welfare fraud, as well as a “spike” in bank deposits.\n\nCitibank, meanwhile, is one of the first major banks to announce that it was going cashless at some of its Australian branches.\n\nEarlier this year, the Sydney Morning Herald released a series of articles promoting cashless ideologies, some of which appear to be written by officials from Australia’s Department of the Treasury.\n\nAlex Hawke, Assistant Minister to the Treasurer, suggests that eliminating cash will “save billions.”\n\nElites within governments, media, banks and academia have formed a unified front that push “cashless” as good for everyone. Legitimate concerns are brushed off through fear-mongering campaigns about fraud and terrorism.\n\nIn reality, governments and the wealthiest ranks of society would mainly benefit from a cashless society because all savings would be in the banking system, and they have full regulatory control over the banks. The middle class is already deeply enmeshed in digital technology.\n\nWith fewer obstacles to impose capital controls or engage in Civil Asset Forfeiture, social inequality could become exacerbated. At the same time, none of these measures actually prevent new underground cash or digital black markets to appear.\n\nIt is mainly a cynical move to limit big banks’ exposure from their real efforts involving risky bets with the global economy.\n\nLegitimate banks have been caught repeatedly manipulating interest rates, creating fake accounts and predatory lending for profit, compromising trust on an institutional level.\n\nWatch On Forbes: Getting Rid Of Pocket Money\n\nAuthor Don Tapscott asks, “Rather than re-distributing wealth, could we pre-distribute it? Could we democratize the way that wealth gets created in the first place?”\n\nMore people need to be engaged in the economy while ensuring that they get fair compensation in the process. Silicon Valley has attempted to do this via digital aggregators of services.\n\nTapscott claims that the so-called “sharing economy” is a lie. New startups Uber and Airbnb have capitalized on old models of centralization to protect billions of dollars from the actual workers who get exploited.\n\nProfits are amassed rather than truly being shared.\n\nAnother innovation on the blockchain is the concept of smart contracts, which could be beneficial for prosperity by offering fair compensation. Middlemen would be cut out of the loop.\n\nAgreements based on reputation and written in software code would self-execute when certain conditions are met, all without the dependence on disproportionately powerful intermediaries.\n\nMoney and influence would come back into the hands of such people who offer their services, create music or write independent news, for example. A healthier balance of power could be achieved for a freer society.\n\nTechnological advances allow for more opportunities, especially in the third world where they are desperately needed.\n\nPersonal data as a new asset class can enable people to own and monetize their raw data rather than giving it all away in return for “access” to big banks or social media websites.\n\nCustomers themselves are actually servicing the companies by providing their information. Corporations rely on capturing everyone’s data to make a profit through the use of targeted ads and more, all of which undermine basic privacy rights.\n\nUneven access to money causes a negative feedback loop in which imagined scarcity leaves billions hungry and unable to make a living.\n\nThere has been massive wealth creation in the digital age, yet there is growing social inequality because centralization is asymmetrical by design.\n\nIt is not just the malcontents who are ideologically bent on defending privacy that stand to benefit from the blockchain.\n\nHeavily centralized institutions are also becoming attractive targets because of their size. They are increasingly easier to hack, as well as slow to adapt in an increasingly faster era.\n\nWall Street giants JP Morgan and Citi, as well as Microsoft and IBM, have all announced projects utilizing different blockchains that could smooth internal operations by eliminating whole days or weeks from contract processing times. Their security would also be greatly enhanced.\n\nThe limited options facing the elites in their respective countries include being replaced or their quiet embracement of decentralized ideologies.",

REUTERS/Alkis Konstantinidis\n\nAt present, a bonus of 50 seats is offered to the party that wins the most votes in a national election, irrespective of how thin or wide the margin of victory is.\n\nThe law also lowers the voting age by a year to 17, a move the Interior Ministry said will ‘sharpen democratic reflexes’ among youngsters.\n\nThe reforms, which were a pre-election pledge of leftist Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras, may heighten political uncertainty in a country which has held four snap elections since 2012. They produced no outright winners but fragile coalitions in a fractious political landscape.\n\n“If one considers that under present circumstances grand coalitions are pretty remote, it’s obvious the new law creates more uncertainty because three or more parties would be required to create a viable government,” said political analyst Costas Panagopoulos, head of the ALCO polling agency.\n\nTsipras and his coalition partner, the right-wing Independent Greeks, are clinging to a narrow majority with 153 seats in parliament, against 147 for the opposition.\n\nTsipras’ Syriza party has been ranking second in opinion polls but is more popular than the conservative opposition among younger age groups.\n\nLowering the voting age was a trend in the European Union and would help restore confidence in a political system that many Greeks blame for their protracted debt crisis, authorities said.\n\n“Our proposal not only addresses an historical demand to boost democracy. It also satisfies a contemporary demand of Greek people’s majority for our political system to be reformed and rejuvenated,” Tsipras said before the vote.\n\nPolling at 4-5 percent for years, Syriza stormed to power for the first time in January 2015 and was re-elected in September after signing up to a third international bailout and agreeing to more austerity.\n\nUnder Greek statutes, a threshold of 200 votes would be required for the abolition of the 50-seat bonus to take effect from the next election. The measure won a simple majority of 179 which means the change would take effect two elections from now.\n\nThe government secured a majority of 151 which was needed for the lowering of the voting age, which can come into effect immediately.\n\nThe left-led coalition of 153 got the backing of the Union of Centrists party, which has 9 seats. The conservative New Democracy party rejected the bill.\n\nYoung Greeks have been hit especially hard by the debt crisis, with more than half of those aged 15-24 out of work, the highest proportion in Europe.\n\n“We chose to give younger Greeks a voice, a more essential role, since this is the generation which risks suffering the impact of the crisis,” the bill said.",

Video provided by Newsy Newslook\n\nAndrew Puzder exits after his meeting with Donald Trump at Trump International Golf Club on Nov. 19, 2016, in Bedminster Township, N.J. (Photo11: Drew Angerer, Getty Images)\n\nWASHINGTON — The downfall of President Trump’s nominee for Labor secretary on Wednesday was the latest setback for an administration that already had been reeling from a particularly bad week.\n\nAndrew Puzder, the fast-food magnate whom Trump had chosen to lead the Department of Labor, withdrew his name from consideration just hours after top Senate Republicans informed the White House that he did not have the votes to win confirmation.\n\nPuzder’s withdrawal came just two days after Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned amid reports that he had misled Vice President Pence about his contacts with a Russian ambassador.\n\nFlynn’s resignation and news reports indicating additional contacts between Trump's camp and Russian intelligence agents brought new calls from Democrats in Congress for an independent investigation into the president’s ties to Moscow.\n\nRead more:\n\nWhat’s more, Rep. Mick Mulvaney, Trump’s pick to lead the Office of Management and Budget, also appeared to be in jeopardy after Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced Wednesday he would oppose the nomination.\n\nSeveral of Trump’s Cabinet nominees have faced intense fire from Democrats and left-leaning interest groups. Puzder, however, was the first to fall.\n\n“After careful consideration and discussions with my family, I am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor,” Puzder said in a statement. “I am honored to have been considered by President Donald Trump to lead the Department of Labor and put America’s workers and businesses back on a path to sustainable prosperity.”\n\nPuzder continued: “I want to thank President Trump for his nomination. I also thank my family and my many supporters — employees, businesses, friends and people who have voiced their praise and hopeful optimism for the policies and new thinking I would have brought to America as Secretary of Labor. While I won't be serving in the administration, I fully support the president and his highly qualified team.\"\n\nI am withdrawing my nomination for Secretary of Labor. I'm honored to have been considered and am grateful to all who have supported me. — Andy Puzder (@AndyPuzder) February 15, 2017\n\nPuzder is the chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants, the parent company of the Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. fast-food chains.\n\nHis nomination galvanized his opponents, who said his opposition to raising the minimum wage and expanding overtime eligibility for workers and accusations that his company had failed to fully investigate allegations of sexual harassment at his restaurants made him unfit for the job.\n\nPuzder also was hobbled by his admission last week that he once employed an undocumented housekeeper and allegations of domestic violence leveled by his former wife — allegations she has since recanted.\n\nThe White House and Senate GOP leaders had stood behind Puzder, even as the attacks against him escalated. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., told reporters on Tuesday that Puzder was “uniquely qualified” for the job.\n\nBut support among rank-and-file Republicans dissipated as the date for his confirmation hearing, which had been scheduled for Thursday, grew closer.\n\nFour GOP senators on the committee that was to hold the hearing — Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Johnny Isakson of Georgia and Tim Scott of South Carolina — had declined to say whether they would support his nomination.\n\nBy Wednesday afternoon, news reports indicated that as many as a dozen Republican senators were planning to withhold their support, effectively dooming his nomination. Democratic senators had been united in their opposition to the nominee.\n\nRead more:\n\nChristine Owens, executive director of the National Employment Law Project, said it was clear from the beginning that Puzder was unfit to serve as labor secretary.\n\n“In nominating Mr. Puzder for labor secretary, President Trump chose for the department that champions workers someone whose views and values are not only antithetical to what workers want and need, but also out of step with mainstream America,” she said.\n\nShe called on Trump to “remain mindful of the promises he made to working families during the campaign and in his inaugural address and nominate a candidate for secretary of labor who will always put workers first and foremost.”\n\nThe National Restaurant Association, however, lamented Puzder’s downfall.\n\n“Andy Puzder would have made a great labor secretary,” said Cicely Simpson, the group’s executive vice president. “We hope that President Trump’s next labor secretary nominee, like Andy, has experience creating jobs and a deep understanding how to get business and government to work together to grow the economy.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/2lkpPx3",

There were many new techniques on this quilt that I was trying for the first time.\n\nThe pattern was new to me, it’s called a Double Pinwheel, and I was so pleased at how all the pieces matched so perfectly.\n\nIt’s a lot easier to do than it looks!\n\nSomething else I tried that was new was the wavy edge finish all along the quilt.\n\nAgain, I was surprised at how well it turned out. The waves came out completely symmetrical something I wasn’t sure would happen. Binding turned out to be a lot more difficult on a wavy edge than on a straight edge. I had to seam rip the first corner, but it didn’t take long to get the hang of it and the remaining three corners went well.\n\nThe last technique I tried was using a stencil as a guide for my free motion quilting.\n\nThat had it’s own unique issues. It took a lot of time just tracing the stencil to the quilt using a disappearing ink marker. I ended up destroying two of them by dragging them through the stencil. Eventually I ended up switch over to the stencil spray. I had a hard time controlling the amount of spray coming out, but it definitely went faster. I’m going to have to do a little more practice in this area.\n\nIn the meantime, I think the final outcome was beautiful. I really love how the quilting turned out because of the stencil.\n\nI’m ready to start my next quilt – I’ve even purchased the fabric.\n\nHere’s a preview!",

He was left to take care of Zerfoss after she was drinking at a party in her home, and the two had sex while he was looking after her.\n\nWhile Farrer argued Zerfoss initiated the sex, Zerfoss has said she was blacked out and had not wanted to have sex. She filed a complaint with IU and the Bloomington Police Department. Farrer was arrested and charged with rape.\n\nAfter a University investigation, Farrer was expelled in November 2015, on the basis that he had violated the University consent policy, which says consent cannot be given by someone who is extremely intoxicated.\n\nFarrer and Zerfoss could not be reached for comment.\n\nThe criminal case against Farrer in Monroe Superior Court, however, was dismissed in September 2016 due to insufficient evidence.\n\nFarrer’s federal lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana.\n\nIt lists Zerfoss and IU as defendants, as well as a slew of University officials: Jason Casares, former deputy Title IX director, Vivian Hernandez, assistant director of IU’s Office of Student Ethics, Harold “Pete” Goldsmith, dean of students, Amber Monroe, IU’s associate director and Title IX deputy investigator and members of the disciplinary panel that expelled Farrer.\n\nAccording to court documents, Farrer is suing for “defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, violations of Title IX” and violation of due process. He alleges that “IU engaged in a gender-biased investigation of Farrer, which culminated in Farrer’s unlawful expulsion from IU.”\n\nMargie Smith-Simmons, IU spokeswoman, said the University cannot comment on the lawsuit or Farrer’s case due to privacy laws.\n\n“The University’s Sexual Misconduct Policy provides for a fair, impartial and robust investigation and adjudication process when responding to reports of alleged sexual assault,” Smith-Simmons said. “Indiana University is strongly committed to providing a safe and secure environment for all members of its community, and assuring that its processes are fair and afford due process protections.”\n\nFarrer is seeking $75,000, demanding a jury trial and is asking to be reinstated as a student at IU, according to court documents.\n\nAn earlier version cited a contradicting court document that listed Farrer as seeking damages in the excess of $75,000.

  "latent_27020": "Lou Williams’ first season with the Hawks ended after just 39 games.\n\nWilliams was lost with a torn anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee, a diagnosis made following an MRI exam Saturday afternoon. The Hawks guard suffered the injury against the Nets Friday. The Hawks’ third leading scorer will require surgery to repair the damaged knee at a to-be-determined date.\n\nCoach Larry Drew called the loss to Williams for the season “devastating.” He was to meet with this team prior to Saturday’s game against the Spurs to implore them to move forward – much as the organization did last season after the loss of Al Horford.\n\n“You hate to see it happen,” Drew said. “You wish for a fast and speedy recovery but we have to conduct business as usual and we have to move on. We have to get somebody in that locker room that is going to have to step up. Any time one of your soldiers is down somebody else has to pick it up. I have confidence that that will happen.”\n\nThe Hawks signed Williams to a multi-year deal as a free agent this summer. He had appeared in all 39 games, mostly off the bench, this season and averaged 14.1 points, 3.6 assists and 2.1 rebounds. In his nine starts, Williams averaged 18.6 points, 5.8 assists and 3.9 rebounds.\n\n“I just pray for him,” Jeff Teague said. “Hopefully it’s a speedy recovery. It is tough losing a guy like that coming off the bench and getting points in bunches. He’s just a good guy all around, a good player, a good friend, someone I enjoy playing with.”\n\nAnthony Morrow said he has spoken to Williams and that he is “doing well considering the circumstances.”\n\nHawks general manager Danny Ferry said the team will stand by Williams as he recovers from the injury and expects him to return next season in full health. Ferry said the team has not yet decided on a course of action for a possible replacement.\n\n“We’ll examine every and all options that can be considered and make decisions from there,” Ferry said.\n\nThe Hawks lost Williams with 7:12 remaining in the second quarter with an initial diagnosis of a right knee sprain pending further tests. Williams was driving to the basket and pulled up without contact as the knee buckled. He screamed out several times as he continued off the court without putting weight on his leg. After lying down in the entryway to the arena to be attended to by Hawks trainers, Williams was taken to the locker room in a wheelchair.\n\nAn X-ray taken in Brooklyn was negative. Williams still could not put any weight on his leg following the game. He was helped to the training room by teammate Mike Scott when the locker room opened to the media post game.\n\nThe MRI exam, done by Dr. Michael Bernot at Peachtree Orthopedics, showed the extent of the injury. While Williams is lost for the season, a more definitive timetable on his return will be released following surgery.\n\nJohn Jenkins will be one of the players to help fill the void left by Williams. The rookie, known for his outside shooting ability, said he expected no trouble stepping in and running the Hawks’ up-tempo offense.\n\n“That is something that I can definitely do,” Jenkins said. “I’ve done it almost my whole life, really. I didn’t do it as much at Vanderbilt because we had guys to do that. I played my role but I can definitely do that. I’m not as fast as Devin (Harris) and (Jeff) Teague but I know how to do that. I can make that adjustment. I’ll be fine with that.”\n\nWilliams, 26, jumped right to the NBA out of South Gwinnett High school. He was drafted and played his first seven seasons with the 76ers before returning home in July.\n\n“You lose that, it’s kind of hard to replace,” DeShawn Stevenson said. “I don’t think you just go out and find someone who can give you 16 points off the bench any time. I think guys have to play within themselves. Things like this happen. It sucks but guys have to be ready to step up and try to fill his shoes.”",

  "latent_27493": "New York, NY — A former Playboy Playmate was refused a gun permit by the NYPD recently, and she says that it is due to a $1.2 million lawsuit that she won against them in 2012.\n\nBy: John Vibes\n\nThis article first appeared at FreeThoughtProject.\n\nNow, Stephanie Adams, Playboy’s Miss November, 1992 is considering a new lawsuit against the NYPD.\n\nThe police say that they denied her permit because she had “domestic issues” in the past. However, those issues that they are referring to are restraining orders against stalkers, which should give her even more of a reason to own firearms.\n\nAdams responded to the initial refusal with detailed explanations of why their assessment was incorrect, but they denied her again. One of the reasons that she cited for needing a gun permit, along with personal protection, was the fact that she just inherited some guns from her recently deceased father.\n\nIn a letter to the department’s pistol license division, Adam’s said, “Filing complaints many years ago against stalkers, rather than fighting them, hurting them or allowing them to hurt myself, is in fact a sign of ‘good moral character’ because I handled those problems peacefully (and) legally.”\n\nAdam’s was also told by officials at the NYPD license division that her permit was denied because there were “sexy pics on the Internet showing her wearing a skimpy police uniform and holding a firearm.”\n\nOne part of the initial letter that was sent to her said, “You are photographed holding what appears to be an NYPD authorized Smith & Wesson 5946, with your finger in a ‘nonsafe’ position in the trigger well.”\n\nAccording to Adams, the NYPD has had a vendetta against her for many years. The feud began in 2006 when police tackled her and “roughed her up” because they accused her of having a gun. At the time, she was actually not carrying a weapon, and the police later admitted in court that it would have been impossible for her to conceal a gun in the tight outfit that she was wearing.\n\nAdams is considering a new lawsuit against the NYPD, this time for denying her a gun permit in retaliation for her previous lawsuit.\n\nThis article first appeared at FreeThoughtProject.",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nCeltics-Knicks Preview\n\nBy BRIAN MAHONEY\n\nPosted Apr 22 2013 6:43PM NEW YORK (AP) The New York Knicks not only expect a Boston adjustment, they can guess what it is. The Celtics never could have accomplished so much over the last six years with as little as they got from Kevin Garnett on Saturday in their playoff opener. So when the teams return to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday for Game 2, Boston plans to feature much more of Garnett, along with the usual dose of Paul Pierce. The response from the Knicks is basically: Go ahead. \"They're going to come back but we've got to worry about ourselves,\" Carmelo Anthony said. \"As long as we do what we have to do, we have a shot and we have a chance at winning the game. We can't be too concerned about what them guys are going to do.\" Garnett was just 4 of 12 from the field in the Knicks' 85-78 victory on Saturday. Perhaps out of rhythm from his lack of game action down the stretch, he finished with eight points and nine rebounds and couldn't take advantage of Tyson Chandler's struggles. \"We've got to involve him more and there's a better way to do it than the way we did it,\" Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. \"And there's certain things that he didn't do, either. We've just got to do a better job of it.\" Garnett played in only five of the final 17 games of the regular season, mostly while battling an ankle injury, and was on the floor for nearly 37 minutes Saturday. But on a day the Celtics got only four points from their reserves and needed much more from their starters, Garnett finished with more fouls than baskets and never attempted a free throw. \"We know we've got to play through Kevin a lot more. I mean, he's probably, he is one of our best passers,\" Pierce said Sunday. \"He's one of our most unselfish players, so we have to do a better job of just getting him the ball, a lot more than he got it yesterday. Doc said he wanted Kevin to be aggressive, he wants him to take 20 shots.\" Part of the problem is the Celtics' lack of a point guard with Rajon Rondo lost for the season with a knee injury. Boston often struggled to get into any offense, especially during its eight-point fourth quarter, and finished the game with 21 turnovers. Even if Garnett doesn't shoot, the Celtics think he can help in that area because of his passing skills. \"Usually he ends up getting four and five assists, so we have to do a better job of involving him because he's good at doing a lot of playmaking duties,\" Pierce said. Chandler missed the final six games of the regular season and played in only four of the last 20 because of a bulging disk. He was scoreless and didn't even take a shot Saturday, finishing with only five rebounds in 20 minutes. He and the Knicks said the problem was just rust, not any recurring pain, and expect him to be better as the playoffs go along. \"Obviously, it's going to be a little stiff, a little sore in there. But I felt great,\" Chandler said. \"It's just when you're out for so long, you're not playing against some park and rec dudes, you're playing against the best of the best. I'm trying to condition myself, playing against the best of the best. It's just getting my timing back, getting my legs under me, getting back into the flow of the game.\" The Knicks can afford to be patient while Chandler regains his stamina as long as they keep getting efforts like they received Saturday from Kenyon Martin, who finished with 10 points and nine rebounds, and played the entire fourth quarter. Along with J.R. Smith, who won the NBA's Sixth Man of the Year award Monday, the Knicks appear to have a huge advantage when the teams have to go to their benches. But Martin expects the Celtics to figure out some way to address Saturday's errors. \"They're well-coached and they know what they have to do,\" Martin said. \"They're going to come here, they're going to scratch, claw, fight, you know what I'm saying, in order to get a game. So we've got to be prepared for whatever.\" Most importantly, Boston needs to run a cleaner offense, with better spacing and much smarter passes. \"A lot of times we found ourselves - I wouldn't say discombobulated, but uneven at times,\" Garnett said. The Knicks haven't held a 2-0 lead since 2000, the last year they won a series. They realize how difficult it will be to win Game 3 on Friday in Boston, when the Celtics will be playing in front of their home fans for the first time since the Boston Marathon bombings, so they don't want to miss their chance to take command Tuesday. \"Tomorrow we're approaching this game as a must-win,\" said Anthony, who scored 36 points in Game 1. \"Here on our home court, we want to win this basketball game. We don't want to go back to Boston 1-1.\" --- Follow Brian Mahoney on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/Briancmahoney\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

The once-mighty Celtics don't seem capable of stopping them. Carmelo Anthony scored 34 points, Sixth Man of the Year J.R. Smith added 19, and New York opened a 2-0 lead over Boston with another dominant second half in an 87-71 victory on Tuesday night. Raymond Felton added 16 points for the Knicks, who used a 27-4 run spanning halftime to blow it open and move halfway to their first series victory since the 2000 Eastern Conference semifinals. This is their first 2-0 lead since sweeping Toronto in the first round that year. \"For us, we know what type of team we are,\" Anthony said. \"We know when we really buckle down on the defensive end, it's been hard for teams.\" It's been brutally difficult for Boston. Paul Pierce scored 18 points for the Celtics, who will host Game 3 on Friday in their first home game since the Boston Marathon bombings. They will have to be much sharper to avoid their first opening-round elimination since 2005, before they became one of the NBA's power teams again. \"We have to figure out the offensive side of the ball and not be so stagnated,\" Boston's Kevin Garnett said. \"Figure out ways to score more often.\" Garnett had 12 points and 11 rebounds, but battled foul trouble and spent too much time walking back to the bench with a raucous Madison Square Garden crowd finally experiencing playoff success again hounding him every step of the way. Plagued by turnovers in Game 1, when they managed eight points in the decisive fourth quarter, the Celtics watched it all fall apart 12 minutes earlier this time. They managed only 23 points after halftime, two fewer than in their 85-78 loss Saturday. \"I thought we attacked them in the first half, but they hung in there,\" Celtics coach Doc Rivers said. \"They didn't let us throw a knockout punch and I thought in the second half they turned that on us and they threw a knockout punch. Several.\" Anthony followed his 36-point opener by making 8 of 13 shots in the second half to finish 11 of 24 for the game. He had said the Knicks needed to treat the game as a \"must-win,\" aware of the difficulty of winning in Boston on Friday with the emotional boost the Celtics will get from finally being home. They showed that mentality after halftime, outscoring Boston 32-11 in the third quarter. \"I think guys know what's at stake. We don't have to talk about it,\" veteran forward Kenyon Martin said. \"Guys know what it's about right now and it's about winning a championship.\" Iman Shumpert drilled two 3-pointers to open the third and tie it before Pierce scored to give Boston its last lead at 50-48. The Knicks scored 18 of the next 20 points, with the Celtics getting just two free throws from Jeff Green over the next 5-plus minutes. Anthony's jumper with 4:25 remaining in the third capped the run before Garnett finally gave Boston its second basket of the quarter 10 seconds later The Celtics missed 10 of their first 11 shots of the third while getting outscored 24-4 to open the period. \"I thought in that third quarter we were as good as we've been all year in terms of ball movement and pushing it and making shots,\" Knicks coach Mike Woodson said. The Celtics vowed to get Garnett more involved after he shot 4 of 12 while scoring eight points in the opener. But that plan was quickly wrecked when he picked up two fouls in the first 3 minutes, 20 seconds. The Celtics shook it off and led 20-15 when Jason Terry made a 3-pointer with 1:57 left for his first basket of the series. But the Knicks scored 11 straight to end the period. Smith, recognized before the game for the award he won Monday, kept the celebration going with five points in the final 6.8 seconds, hitting a 36-footer at the buzzer with Celtics all over him to make it 26-20. The Celtics quickly settled down again, ripping off an 11-0 run to take a 31-27 lead on another 3-pointer by Terry. The lead later grew to eight when Pierce made a jumper, then fired a lob pass that traveled about three-quarters of the court to a streaking Green. They led 48-39, gave up the last three points of the half - and probably never realized they gave away momentum for good with it. \"We made a good run in the first half, we played our style of basketball,\" Terry said. \"But in the second half we definitely got away from what gave us success.\" Notes: Amare Stoudemire still hopes to return from right knee surgery for the second round if the Knicks advance. He hopes to be running full speed soon so he can see how the knee responds to the additional work. ...

  "latent_27648": "Following their Selection Sunday disappointment, Baylor has mostly kept its mouth shut about its College Football Playoff snub in favor of Big Ten champion Ohio State.\n\nThat changed on Sunday.\n\n“It pisses us off,” said quarterback Bryce Petty.\n\nThe Bears seemed to buy into the theory that they were left out in favor of the Buckeyes simply because they are Baylor and Ohio State is Ohio State.\n\n“If we had a bigger name like that, I feel like those guys would have been in quick, but being Baylor, we’ve been making a name for ourselves in the last couple years and have to try to remain at the top,” wide receiver Antwan Goodley told FoxSportsSouthwest.com. “I kind of already knew what the committee thought about Baylor. I knew they probably would not put us in the playoffs. I’d say half of that is on us, but we can’t control that.”\n\n“We’re not scrubby little Baylor anymore,” added offensive tackle Spencer Drango.\n\nWhether they truly feel this way or it’s all Art Briles psychological gamesmanship, the Bears have bought in.\n\n“This isn’t the Baylor from 10 years ago. Hopefully, sooner or later, people will and accept us for our play on the field and not who we were back in the day,” Petty said. “Teams change. You’ve got to adapt and understand some people don’t want it that way. Some people want the big money schools and that’s fine. But we’re going to go out here and play football and we’re going to be dang good at it. That’s our motivation.”\n\nOne thing is abundantly clear, however: Baylor can’t become 2004 Cal reincarnated. Baylor will turn from sympathetic underdogs to an arrogant laughingstock if they don’t actually beat Michigan State, a team that, by the way, No. 4 Ohio State handled in East Lansing earlier this season.",
  "latent_27651": "Christopher John Nowinski (born September 24, 1978) is an American author, co-founder and executive director of the Concussion Legacy Foundation; as well as a former professional wrestler with World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Nowinski was WWE's first Harvard alumnus, as he graduated with a BA in sociology. Nowinski also played college football at Harvard, where he was an All-Ivy defensive tackle. He is also recognized as the youngest Hardcore Champion in WWE history. Following his wrestling career, he wrote Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis, which examined the long-term effects of head trauma among athletes, and also became a documentary.\n\nProfessional wrestling career [ edit ]\n\nTough Enough circuit and independent work (2001) [ edit ]\n\nNowinski was one of the three finalists on WWE's (at the time trading as WWF) first series of Tough Enough, which Maven Huffman won. After failing to win the competition, Nowinski made appearances in independent promotions before being hired by WWF and entering its developmental territories. Nowinski competed as Chris Harvard, capitalizing on his status as an alumnus of Harvard University. Nowinski made his first major independent appearance in London, UK for the Frontier Wrestling Alliance promotion at its Lights Camera Action show on December 14, 2001. Nowinski competed in its main event teaming up with Alex Shane to defeat Drew McDonald and Flash Barker.[4] Though this was the only show Nowinski did for the promotion, he regards it as the best promotion he has ever worked for outside of WWE.[5]\n\nWorld Wrestling Entertainment (2002–2003) [ edit ]\n\nOn the June 10, 2002, episode of Raw, Nowinski debuted in WWE as a heel and stayed heel, helping William Regal beat Bradshaw in a European Championship match. Nowinski had a short-lived alliance with Regal, defeating Spike Dudley in his debut match the following week with Regal in his corner. Nowinski teamed with Regal on the June 24 episode of Raw, defeating Bradshaw and Dudley. Nowinski continued to feud with Bradshaw over the next few weeks, with their feud ending on the July 8 episode of Raw, where Nowinski teamed with Jackie Gayda in a losing effort against Bradshaw and Trish Stratus, while also trying to warming up Regal from his breakdown after he lost the European Championship to Jeff Hardy. Nowinski feuded with The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley and Spike Dudley) through the summer.\n\nNowinski defeated Tommy Dreamer on the September 9 episode of Raw. A week later, Dreamer attacked Nowinski in a classroom. Their feud ended on the October 14 episode of Raw, where Nowinski was once again successful in defeating Dreamer. Over the next few weeks, Nowinski claimed victories over Jeff Hardy and Booker T before starting a feud with his former Tough Enough trainer, Al Snow. After defeating Snow in two consecutive weeks, Maven began to help Snow against Nowinski. On the November 25 episode of Raw, Nowinski went against Maven in a match that ended in a no contest. Nowinski teamed with D'Lo Brown to defeat Snow and Maven on two occasions. Nowinski then continued his feud with Maven into 2003, where Test aligned himself with Maven for a few weeks, successfully defeating Nowinski and Brown on January 13, 2003 episode of Raw.\n\nOn the March 31 episode of Raw, Nowinski was defeated by Scott Steiner. The feud come to an end on the May 12 episode of Raw, where Nowinski teamed with La Résistance (Rene Dupree and Sylvain Grenier) in a losing effort against Steiner, Test and Goldust. On the May 26 episode of Raw, Nowinski aligned himself with Thuggin' And Buggin' Enterprises, an African American wrestling stable consisting of Rodney Mack, Jazz and their manager Theodore Long. At Insurrection, Nowinski teamed with Mack and Long in a losing effort against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray Dudley, D-Von Dudley and Spike Dudley). At Bad Blood, Nowinski and Mack defeated The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and Devon). Nowinski wrestled his final match with WWE, due to him suffering with post-concussion syndrome, on the June 23 episode of Raw, in a losing effort against Maven. After a full year of post-concussion symptoms he chose to retire from wrestling.[6]\n\nWriting career [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2006, Nowinski self-published a book, Head Games: Football's Concussion Crisis, which details his career-ending injury and discusses the dangers of concussions in football and other contact sports; the book includes stories from National Football League (NFL) players and fellow wrestlers, and has an introduction written by former governor of Minnesota and professional wrestler, Jesse Ventura.[citation needed]\n\nLater that year, Nowinski initiated an inquiry into the suicide of Andre Waters, a 44-year-old former NFL defensive back who shot himself on November 20, 2006. Waters had sustained several concussions over his career, and at Nowinski's behest, Waters' family agreed to send pieces of his brain to be tested. Bennet Omalu, a pathologist at the University of Pittsburgh announced that \"the condition of Waters' brain tissue was what would be expected in an 85-year-old man, and there were characteristics of someone being in the early stages of Alzheimer's.\"[7][8]\n\nNowinski played an integral role in the discovery of the fourth case of chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) in a former NFL football player, former Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Justin Strzelczyk, who was killed in an automobile crash in 2004 at age 36.[9] Julian Bailes, the chairman of the department of neurosurgery at West Virginia University and the Steelers' team neurosurgeon during Strzelczyk's career, insisted to Nowinski over a phone conversation that he thought Strzelczyk's death, which was precipitated by strange behavior that some had labeled as \"bipolar\", was worth looking into due to its similarities to the Andre Waters case. Nowinski contacted Omalu, who discovered the brain was still available, and Nowinski called Mary Strzelczyk, Justin's mother, to ask for permission to Omalu to examine it for CTE. Omalu's positive diagnosis was confirmed by two other neuropathologists.[10][11]\n\nNowinski also collaborated with Ted Johnson, former New England Patriots linebacker, on symptoms of concussions after Johnson (who received over half a dozen concussions in his career) retired from the NFL after much controversy. Johnson was commissioned to write the foreword in Nowinski's book but at the last minute decided to pull what he had written.[12]\n\nNowinski alerted police and the coroner of Chris Benoit, asking them to do a brain exam on Benoit's brain to see if concussions had any part in his rage or depression at the time of the double-homicide of his family and his suicide.[13] In June 2007, Nowinski co-founded the Sports Legacy Institute (now the Concussion Legacy Foundation), an organization dedicated to furthering awareness of and research on sports-related head injuries, and increasing the safety of contact and collision sports worldwide. Nowinski's work was documented on ESPN's Outside the Lines on September 5, 2007. On the same day, Benoit's brain examination report showed extensive damage due to concussions that could have led to dementia. The Concussion Legacy Foundation (CLF) and Michael Benoit, Chris' father, have started the Benoit Family Fund for Brain Injury Research.[14]\n\nConcussion Legacy Foundation [ edit ]\n\nSince Nowinski's departure from WWE and the publication of his book Head Games, he has garnered a significant amount of media attention, making numerous appearances on networks such as ESPN and CNN to discuss sports-related head injuries. Nowinski continues to work as a consultant for Trinity Partners while serving as Co-Founder and President of the Concussion Legacy Foundation (CLF), formerly known as Sports Legacy Institute.[15] The CLF was founded on June 14, 2007 in Boston, Massachusetts by Nowinski and Dr. Robert Cantu in reaction to new medical research indicating brain trauma in sports had become a public health crisis. Dr. Cantu wrote the foreword in a 2012 update of Head Games to accompany the release of the documentary of the same name. Postmortem analysis of the brain tissue of former contact sports athletes was revealing that repetitive brain injuries, both concussions and subconcussive blows, could lead to the neurodegenerative disease chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE). In addition, an absence of awareness and education on concussions, specifically proper diagnosis and management, was allowing the disease to proliferate. Finally, with brain trauma becoming the signature injury of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, this research/education model could also be applied to the military.\n\nCLF, according to Nowinski, was founded to solve this concussion crisis in sports and the military through medical research, treatment, and education & prevention. The initial vision of the CLF was to formalize neuropathological research and develop and treatment, via partnership with a top-tier university medical school. To that end, the CLF began such a partnership with Boston University School of Medicine (BUSM) in September 2008, collaborating in formation of its Center for the Study of Traumatic Encephalopathy (CTE Center). Subsequently, CLF has sought to develop ways to raise awareness of the issue and to directly educate coaches, athletes and parents. In 2009, it created a Coaches Concussion Clinic program. The CLF has been featured in articles in The New York Times,[16] on news programs such as 60 Minutes[17] and Frontline,[citation needed] and has appeared in various segments on CNN, ESPN, and other networks.[citation needed]\n\nIn September 2015, the Sports Legacy Institute announced a rebrand and changed its name to the Concussion Legacy Foundation. The rebrand aimed to align the evolution of the organization’s programs with its name. The organization is still led by its co-founders, Nowinski and Dr. Robert Cantu.[18]\n\nNowinski is a co-director at the CTE Center of BUSM, where he works closely with Ann McKee, M.D., and other center experts, as a liaison making contact with athletes and families of deceased athletes, to further case studies that examine brain tissues impacted by CTE. Nowinski's work on concussion research has led him to act as a spokesperson for his fellow experts at the CTE Center (e.g., M.D./Ph.D. faculty members Robert Cantu, Ann McKee, Robert A. Stern, and Lee Goldstein); in this role he provides a voice for the field of concussion-related research and awareness. Nowinski appeared on Stan Lee's Superhumans as a non-medical expert on concussions. Hockey News listed Nowinski on its 2011 edition of the 100 Most Powerful people in ice hockey as one of the Top 40 under the age of 40. This recognition was attributed to his ability in getting hockey players to donate brain tissue after death.[19]\n\nChampionships and accomplishments [ edit ]\n\nNowinski appearing at the Killer Kowalski Memorial Show in 2008.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]",
  "latent_27666": "Every folly begins with a Cassandra accurately predicting the outcome — and totally being ignored. This week in Toronto, she took the form of Ward 14 Councillor Gord Perks, whose sensible motion to fix the one glaring flaw in Mayor John Tory’s SmartTrack plan disappeared under the weight of 35 contrary votes and the unfortunate resurrection of the Rob Ford horror show. The downtown leftist was duly respectful, even going so far as to call SmartTrack “brilliant.” But let’s not risk the best of it, he advised, by continuing to pretend the controversial stretch along Eglinton West is even remotely feasible.\n\nDuring the municipal election Mayor John Tory advocated his SmartTrack plan, which uses existing rail lines in Toronto and adds 22 new transit stops in the next seven years. But SmartTrack has a glaring flaw on Eglinton West because the right-of-way no longer exists, writes John Barber. ( Richard Lautens / Toronto Star file photo )\n\nWith the new Ford circus in full swing, council bet $1.65 million — the cost of studying the Eglinton West stretch — that he was wrong. But he isn’t. The question today is how much more it will cost before that becomes obvious. In fact, it was obvious the moment Tory, as candidate, unveiled SmartTrack. His plan used existing GO tracks everywhere except in the west, where it proposed to build a new heavy-rail “surface subway” running merrily alongside Eglinton deep into Mississauga. The problem: that right-of-way no longer exists. The SmartTrack planners, it seems, were too busy with their coloured markers to visit Etobicoke, where they would have seen all kinds of new homes and condos being built along the corridor their outdated maps encouraged them to appropriate.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nThe deep green boulevard that for so long bordered the northern edge of Eglinton between the Humber River and Highway 427 was created originally to accommodate the (mercifully) unbuilt Richview Expressway. And as the SmartTrackers knew, it was ripe for a surface subway. But what they didn’t know is that the Ford council had declared it surplus and Build Toronto has been carving it up and selling it off ever since. The result of this revelation during the election was great sport for reporters and Tory’s opponents, who fairly estimated that tunnelling Eglinton would add untold millions to the SmartTrack budget. But all to no avail, because the citizenry had made up its collective mind. SmartTrack was visionary and contrary facts small-minded. But now the facts are fighting back. In addition to the daunting prospect of tunnelling the proposed new line, they focus on the Herculean engineering required to attach it to the rest of the system at Mount Dennis. Failed mayoral candidates Olivia Chow and Doug Ford may have gotten nowhere with their criticisms of the plan during the campaign, but everything they said about it — always focusing on Eglinton West — was true. So far, council has only spent $1.65-million on the project of reconciling a slapdash election promise with reality. But it is already clear that tunnelling a new subway to Mississauga will explode Tory’s promise to deliver SmartTrack within seven years at a budget price of $8 billion. And all the while there will be an affordable, effective, fully designed and pre-approved alternative just waiting to go. The reason council moved to sell off the Richview corridor in the first place is that it had just approved a plan to run a light-rail line along Eglinton West as part of its Transit City program. Politics subsequently arrested the planned westward progress of the Eglinton Crosstown LRT at Mount Dennis, but there is no reason for it not to continue as planned. Even the environmental assessment is complete.\n\nAn LRT built as planned along Eglinton West would accomplish almost everything SmartTrack promises at a small fraction of the cost and with minimum (if any) hassle. And it could easily be completed within Tory’s self-imposed seven-year limit. Perhaps the saddest aspect of the current Eglinton rail-traffic jam is that it could stall the entire SmartTrack initiative. Conceived as an in-city enhancement of the province’s GO network, SmartTrack really does live up to its name. It’s also brilliant politically, because the province will do most of the work of electrifying the corridor while the city claims ownership of the result — a partnership deal Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne has embraced gladly.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nProvincial partnership also promises the possibility at least of credible financing for SmartTrack — the lack of which is another giant hole in the current plan. Today, however, Eglinton stands as its most glaring flaw. One can only hope that the cost of ignoring that — and saving the new mayor’s face with ongoing studies and assessments — will remain in the low millions.

While the show's executives might be pushing a political agenda, it seems at least some members of the production crew are not.\n\nAccording to TMZ, sources working with the production claim that members of the crew are livid over the fact that top executives have altered all existing bathrooms on set to unisex:\n\nWe're told the brass changed the drill ... from now on both bathrooms are open to all, with no restrictions. Just come on in and do your business, regardless of who's there. Check out the sign -- it shows women and men ... and the symbol commonly used for all-genders. The beef is that men, women and transgenders can all enter as they please, making it uncomfortable for some of the crew. Women are particularly worried about walking in and seeing a dude peeing at the urinal. Now this is interesting ... we're told several crew members are too scared to complain, for fear they'll be labeled \"transphobic,\" which would be the kiss of death on that set.\n\nThe series has been critically acclaimed, winning Golden Globes in 2015 for best comedy series and best lead actor. The show is reportedly loosely based on the family of creator Jill Soloway, whose father is also transgender.\n\nWhat people on the left always fail to realize is that it is fine to hold a certain set of beliefs, but it is not fine to push those beliefs on others.

  "latent_27730": "THE TICKER\n\nHouse Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.) and Senate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell (R-Wisc.). (Reuters/Aaron P. Bernstein)\n\nThe GOP tax bill that emerges from negotiations as soon as this week could prove less sweet for the Mars family than the candy-making magnates hope.\n\nHouse Republicans, backed by some deep-pocketed outside interests, are angling for the final package to include a full repeal of the estate tax, long a conservative bête noire that falls on a vanishingly tiny slice of the population. But Senate GOP leaders will draw a red line on their proposal to double its exemption to $22 million for couples, a Republican Senate aide tells me, saving $68 billion over the House version.\n\nGOP leaders intend to argue full repeal is a nonstarter by pointing to senators who won't swallow it. It’s a dynamic that probably will repeat itself across the rest of the disagreements Republicans aim to iron out this week.\n\nHouse Republicans have set the pace for the tax rewrite all year, with the bill they passed tracking, despite important changes, the “Better Way” blueprint they released in June 2016. But in the conclusive tug-of-war between the chambers this week, their Senate counterparts will look to maximize their pull by pointing to the party’s razor-thin margin in the upper chamber.\n\nSen. Susan Collins (R-Maine) underlined the threat in a Sunday appearance on CBS’s “Face the Nation,” telling host John Dickerson that leaders can’t take her support for granted. “I always wait until the final version of the bill is brought before us, before I make a final decision on whether or not to support it,” Collins said. “There are major differences between the House and Senate bills. And I don't know where the bill is going to come out.”\n\nSenate Republicans can only lose two votes and still pass a bill — a margin that will shrink by half if Democrat Doug Jones wins the special election in Alabama on Tuesday to fill Attorney General Jeff Sessions’s old Senate seat. The winner of that race may not be seated until next year, however.\n\nThe final chapter of a process defined by its breakneck speed probably has twists left in store. As my colleague Erica Werner reports in a story that posted Sunday night:\n\n“The melding process underway has opened the door to another frenzy of 11th-hour lobbying as special interests, including President Trump’s rich friends, make one last dash for cash before the final bill speeds through both chambers of Congress and onto Trump’s desk. Passage is expected the week before Christmas… Many lobbyists, Democrats and other observers expect to find the final version of the plan, which could be filed late this week, just as full of surprises as the various iterations that have appeared. But as they gun for a legislative win that has eluded them this year, Republicans show little interest in slowing down to take a closer look.”\n\nAnd some recently discovered problems need fixing. The Wall Street Journal’s Richard Rubin identifies one: \"Some high-income business owners could face marginal tax rates exceeding 100% under the Senate’s tax bill, far beyond the listed tax rates in the Republican plan. That means a business owner’s next $100 in earnings, under certain circumstances, would require paying more than $100 in additional federal and state taxes.\"\n\nThe New York Times’s Patricia Cohen finds another, for which there is no apparent fix in the works: \"In most places, a dollar is a dollar. But in the tax code envisioned by Republicans, the amount you make may be less important than how you make it. Consider two chefs working side by side for the same catering company, doing the same job, for the same hours and the same money. The only difference is that one is an employee, the other an independent contractor… Economists and tax experts across the political spectrum warn that the proposed system would invite tax avoidance. The more the tax code distinguishes among types of earnings, personal characteristics or economic activities, the greater the incentive to label income artificially, restructure or switch categories in a hunt for lower rates.\"\n\nWhat won’t meaningfully change is that a bill President Trump, his team and party have sold as a middle class boon in fact delivers the bulk of its benefits to corporations and the wealthy. If you missed it, The Post’s Damian Paletta over the weekend laid out how the measure missed its mark so profoundly. Read it here.\n\nMARKET MOVERS\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. (AP /Jacquelyn Martin)\n\nKey question for the Fed: What's next? Business Insider's Pedro Nicolaci da Costa: \"Federal Reserve policy has become sufficiently predictable that this week’s interest-rate hike matters a lot less than any hints the central bank may give about the pace of rate increases next year and beyond.\n\nA December rise in the federal funds rate to a range of 1.25% to 1.50% has long been baked into Wall Street estimates. Economists will therefore be paying closer attention to the Federal Open Market Committee’s policy statement, its latest economic forecasts and Janet Yellen's last press conference as the central bank chair. The meeting will take place on December 12 and 13...\n\nFed Governor Jerome Powell is set to replace Yellen when her term ends in February, and several remaining open seats on the Fed’s board are making it more difficult than usual for Fed watchers to gauge the future of monetary policy. In this context, the Fed’s often dismissed 'dot-plot' of officials’ own estimates for future rate hikes could gain added importance.\"\n\nNYT's Binyamin Appelbaum: \"Fed officials already expected the economy to keep growing in 2018, and unemployment to keep falling. But economic reports in recent months have exceeded expectations, including Friday’s estimate by the Commerce Department that employers added 228,000 jobs in November. That has raised the possibility that the economy is continuing to gain strength... On the other hand, inflation remains oddly sluggish, up just 1.6 percent over the 12 months ending in October. That has prompted a debate among Fed officials. Most, including Ms. Yellen, expect inflation and wages to rise as worker availability dwindles. But a minority sees no harm in patience...\n\nThe pending tax cut is a complicating factor. Monetary policy influences economic conditions gradually. In adjusting interest rates, the Fed must anticipate the evolution of those conditions. It also faces political pressure from Republicans who do not want the benefits of their tax legislation to be offset by faster rate increases.\"\n\nBitcoin Futures Start With a Bang as 26% Rally Triggers Halts Dealers said volume was high for a new contract, even though it was tiny relative to more established futures.

The president’s speech will take place in Washington, said the person, who wasn’t authorized to speak publicly about the event.

'I'm absolutely confident, I have it in writing, a statement by both Mitch McConnell and Speaker Ryan,' she said. While the tax reform bill is negotiated in conference committee, Collins said she’s been given no reason to worry that her deal has been tossed aside. 'I’ve had a lot of conversations, not only with my colleagues in the Senate but with my colleagues from the House side and with the White House, I've talked to the president three times about this issue, and once again I have no reason to believe that that commitment will not be kept,' she said.\"\n\n— Americans don't like the bill, part 1,732.

Americans are skeptical of the fundamental arguments Republicans have made in selling the bill: A 53% majority of those surveyed predict their own families won't pay lower taxes as a result of the measure, and an equal 53% say it won't help the economy in a major way... Overall, only 35% believe that the bill will boost the economy, and 31% that their own families' tax bills will be lowered as a result. Nearly two-thirds, 64%, say the wealthy will get the most benefits; just 17% say the middle-class will.\"\n\n— Middle class may not notice cut. Bloomberg's Sahil Kapur: \"A funny thing happened when Congress approved a tax cut for the middle class eight years ago: Most Americans didn’t notice.

A February 2010 poll found that just 12 percent said their taxes had been reduced. More than half, 53 percent, said they saw no change. A remarkable 24 percent thought their taxes had increased...\n\nThat 2009 tax cut contains warning signs for President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans. Their tax plans would deliver about the same level of initial relief to households with incomes between $40,000 and $100,000 -- roughly $800 on average -- according to data from Congress’s Joint Committee on Taxation. If those numbers hold, and if history’s any guide, Trump’s working-class voters may not feel the tax cut he has repeatedly promised them.\"\n\n— Unleashing churches and charities. WSJ's Julie Bykowicz: \"A provision in the tax code overhaul before Congress could lead to an infusion of new players in elections, including churches and charities, and prompt a significant shift in the way political campaigns are financed.\n\nThe House tax bill would allow churches and other nonprofits to advocate for candidates and take political positions without jeopardizing their tax-exempt status, rolling back what’s known as the Johnson Amendment. The Senate plan doesn’t take that step, meaning it will be one of many items up for debate as lawmakers work to pass a law that President Donald Trump can sign before the year’s end. The conference committee is set to hold its first meeting Wednesday...\n\nIt is unclear if Republican senators will agree to add it to the final bill, but it they do Democratic senators are preparing to fight the move by invoking the Byrd rule, which prohibits the Senate from considering nonrevenue matters as part of any reconciliation bill.\"\n\n— Fear over end of medical deduction. The Post's Heather Long: \"The House tax bill would eliminate the deduction, while the Senate bill would keep it (and even make it a bit more generous). It’s a key difference that must be reconciled before the final legislation goes to President Trump...\n\nThe medical deduction started in 1942 to help Americans deal with what lawmakers at the time called the 'extraordinary' costs of medical care, the kind that hit when someone in the family has cancer or needs round-the-clock care. Currently, anyone can deduct medical expenses that account for more than 10 percent of their adjusted gross income (income minus deductions and exemptions). The Senate bill would expand that to 7.5 percent of income for this year and next. In 2015, 8.8 million Americans used the deduction. Over half were older than 65, according to AARP.\"\n\n— Bad news for aspiring homeowners. CNN Money's Kathryn Vasel: \"There's a housing affordability crisis unfolding in many parts of the country.\n\nAnd the situation could get worse under potential changes to the federal tax code. Lawmakers may take a scalpel to a set of tax benefits designed to entice developers to build affordable housing and public facilities -- like schools and hospitals -- in poor neighborhoods. Meanwhile, nearly 39 million households can't afford their housing, according to a report out this summer from the Harvard's Joint Center for Housing Studies...\n\nThe House tax plan eliminates private activity bonds. These tax-exempt bonds are issued by state and local entities, and the money from them is loaned to for-profit and non-profit private companies to fund eligible projects, including health care centers and libraries. The affordable housing market also relies heavily on these bonds, which would be preserved in the Senate plan. If the bonds lose their tax-exemption status, more than 780,000 fewer affordable rental homes would be built or preserved over the next 10 years, according to Novogradac & Co.\"\n\nPOCKET CHANGE\n\nCohn Downplays Bitcoin Risks White House economic adviser Gary Cohn said he and other administration officials are monitoring the meteoric rise in cryptocurrency bitcoin, while adding that he didn’t see any serious threat in the phenomenon.

WSJ\n\nTRUMP TRACKER\n\nPresident Trump. (AP Photo/Susan Walsh)\n\n— Infrastructure's next. WSJ's Ted Mann: \"The White House is preparing to roll out a long-delayed infrastructure rebuilding plan in January, as President Donald Trump’s advisers bet that voters want a $1 trillion road-and-bridge-building plan—even though it is opposed by some lawmakers. Mr. Trump’s advisers are putting finishing touches on a plan to direct federal spending of $200 billion or more—funds it would propose to offset with cuts elsewhere in the federal budget—to leverage hundreds of billions more from local governments and private investors to pay for road, rail, water and utility upgrades.\n\nWhite House officials have said for months they hoped to turn to infrastructure once Congress has enacted an overhaul of the tax code, which has occupied the Republican establishment and its business allies for the past several months. More recently, Republicans have signaled they plan to focus on another posttax priority, a revamp of the nation’s welfare system. They also hope to revisit a repeal of the Affordable Care Act next year. Big legislation can be more difficult in an election year, but Mr. Trump’s political advisers say they believe they​have public support. That runs counter to widespread doubts in Washington that Congress will want to craft a major spending initiative on the heels of a tax package that could raise the deficit by more than $1 trillion.\"\n\n— And targeting the safety net. Politico's Andrew Restuccia, Sarah Ferris, and Helena Bottemiller Evich: \"The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress are hoping to make the most sweeping changes to federal safety net programs in a generation, using legislation and executive actions to target recipients of food stamps, Medicaid and housing benefits. The White House is quietly preparing a sweeping executive order that would mandate a top-to-bottom review of the federal programs on which millions of poor Americans rely. And GOP lawmakers are in the early stages of crafting legislation that could make it more difficult to qualify for those programs.\n\nIn the meantime, the Trump administration has already begun making policy shifts that could have major ramifications. Federal health officials are encouraging states to impose work requirements on able-bodied adults on Medicaid — a major philosophical shift that would treat the program as welfare, rather than health insurance. The Agriculture Department said last week that it would soon give states greater control over the food stamp program, potentially opening the door to drug testing or stricter work requirements on recipients of the $70 billion program long targeted by fiscal conservatives...\n\nWhile candidate Donald Trump pledged to protect some safety net programs, conservatives have long wanted to devolve control of social programs to the states and impose stricter work and drug testing rules. Now that they control both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue, Republicans believe they have a once-in-a-generation opportunity to overhaul those programs, which they have long argued are wasteful, are too easily exploited and promote dependency.\"\n\nRUSSIA WATCH:\n\nWatch: Republicans question the FBI's integrity as the Mueller probe intensifies:\n\n— Mueller flags hottest Manafort docs. Bloomberg's David Glovin: \"Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigators have spent the last six months sifting through financial records related to Paul Manafort and Rick Gates. Now it’s Manafort’s and Gates’s turn.\n\nMueller disclosed on Friday that he’s gathered a huge collection of bank records and other documents as part of his prosecution of Manafort, the former campaign manager for President Donald Trump, and Gates, his onetime business associate. The cache is so enormous -- 400,000 items in all -- that Mueller labeled at least 2,000 documents as “hot” to draw the Manafort defense team’s attention to the most important ones.\n\nThe collection, which prosecutors expect to provide to Manafort’s lawyers by Dec. 11, underscores how much financial and legal pressure is being brought to bear on the two. Manafort and Gates face money laundering and conspiracy charges as part of Mueller’s probe into Russian influence on last year’s election, and their legal teams must now review every document and many of the related transactions before trial next year.\"\n\n— Trump data firm chief to testify. Bloomberg's Billy House: \"The chief executive officer of a data firm that worked for President Donald Trump’s campaign is set to testify in private before the House Intelligence Committee as part of its probe into Russian election interference on Dec. 14, according to a person familiar with the panel’s schedule. Lawmakers likely will ask Alexander Nix, CEO of the data and analysis firm Cambridge Analytica, whether he sought material from WikiLeaks publisher Julian Assange that was stolen from computers of the Democratic National Committee and John Podesta, who managed Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign. Nix said at a November technology conference in Lisbon that in “early June 2016,” he contacted WikiLeaks after Assange publicly claimed he had Clinton emails and planned to publish them. Assange previously told the Associated Press that WikiLeaks had rejected a “request for information” from Cambridge Analytica.\"\n\nCHART TOPPER\n\nFrom The Post's Christopher Ingraham: \"Americans are drowning in debt.

  "latent_27759": "American research finds cancer food scares don't stand up to scrutiny with most culprit ingredients showing little or no increased risk of disease\n\nThey are mainstay stories of tabloid newspapers and women's magazines, linking common foods from burnt toast to low-fat salad dressing to cancer. But now US scientists have warned that many reports connecting familiar ingredients with increased cancer risk have little statistical significance and should be treated with caution.\n\n\"When we examined the reports, we found many had borderline or no statistical significance,\" said Dr Jonathan Schoenfeld of Harvard Medical School.\n\nIn a paper in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, Schoenfeld and his co-author, John Ioannidis of Stanford University, say trials have repeatedly failed to find effects for observational studies which had initially linked various foods to cancer. Nevertheless these initial studies have often triggered public debates \"rife with emotional and sensational rhetoric that can subject the general public to increased anxiety and contradictory advice\".\n\nRecent reports have linked colouring in fizzy drinks, low-fat salad dressing, burnt toast and tea to elevated cancer risk. In the past, red meat, hot dogs, doughnuts and bacon have also been highlighted. The cancer risks involved in excess alcohol consumption are not disputed by scientists, but other links have been less easy to substantiate.\n\nTo examine the implications of these reports, Schoenfeld and Ioannidis selected ingredients at random from the Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. \"We used random numbers to select recipes and collected the ingredients from these\" said Schoenfeld. \"This gave us a good range of common – and a few not so common – foods. Then we put each of those ingredients into a search engine to find out their associations with cancer risks in medical literature. We found that 40 out of the 50 ingredients we had selected had been studied as having possible links with cancer. The 10 that had not been studied were less common ingredients.\"\n\nAmong the 40 foods that had been linked to cancer risks were flour, coffee, butter, olives, sugar, bread and salt, as well as peas, duck, tomatoes, lemon, onion, celery, carrot, parsley and lamb, together with more unusual ingredients, including lobster, tripe, veal, mace, cinnamon and mustard.\n\nSchoenfeld and Ioannidis then analysed the scientific papers produced after initial investigations into these foods. They also looked at how many times an ingredient was supposed to increase cancer risk and the statistical significance of the studies.\n\n\"Statistical significance\" is the term used for an assessment of whether a set of observations reflects a real pattern or one thrown up by chance. The two researchers' work suggests that many reports linking foodstuffs to cancer revealed no valid medical pattern at all.\n\n\"We found that, if we took one individual study that finds a link with cancer, it was very often difficult to repeat that in other studies,\" said Schoenfeld. \"People need to know whether a study linking a food to cancer risk is backed up before jumping to conclusions.\"\n\nAdditional research by Gemma O'Neill",

Search for \"Let It Go from Frozen – AW Cover\".\n\nanswerkey\n\nDo you have the Internet on Remnant?\n\nTheRealWeissSchnee\n\nSort of. We can access a distributed, connected repository of information and services. It doesn't really have the kind of personal stuff and communities the Internet has, though. It's mostly educational and informational stuff with some commercial interests. And it's not worldwide or connected the same- mostly stuff nearby and it gets slower as the distance to a target grows. According to a Terran I talked to, it's more like the early Internet in intent if much more modern technologically.

Is the real Schnee Dust Company this immoral, illegal, and unethical?\n\nTheRealWeissSchnee\n\nYes and no. Business is done different on Remnant, and in Atlas especially. The Schnee Dust Company does not break any laws per se. Although prosperous, it's governed much like a third-world republic, and the Schnee Dust Company has close ties to the current dictator. So we influence the government to give us an advantageous position. As for the infamous labour practices, unfortunately there is no exaggeration. It's not a matter of race past the convenience of exploiting a group already disadvantaged.\n\nDRAGONS1111\n\nBlake: Is it racist to automatically think you like Tuna even if it's true?

As a former member of the White Fang, what would you say to people going through this process.\n\nblack_belladonnas\n\nDon't. It may seem alluring to fight for a cause you believe in, but the romanticism quickly wears off and you realize you've built a personal hell that makes everyone around you suffer.

  "latent_28077": "On behalf of everyone at Flix, I would like to say a huge thank you to each and every one of you for your pledges, comments, and support. It has been amazing (and humbling!) for us to hear that you are as excited about the game as we are, and want to play it as soon as possible. We have read every comment and have taken all that you have said onboard.\n\nSo, due to the feedback and slow traction on Kickstarter we have listened to your feedback and decided that today we are cutting our Kickstarter short. We are proudly announcing that no matter what happens, we will create Eden Star, and you can get your hands on an updated version of the Pre-Alpha Combat Tech Demo via the Eden Star website with every pre-order of the game. This allows us to make builds of the game available at the earliest opportunity and at the lowest price point for early backers, but not compromise on the quality that we at Flix forever aspire to deliver.\n\nLet's keep it simple! Any early pre-orders of the project will be able to be purchased at the discounted price of $15, and will receive access to the very first playable Eden Star Alpha build and all updates thereafter. All backers will also receive the Eden Star Pre-Alpha (created in UE3. ETA: December 2013), if you would like to pledge more, then you can!\n\nBackers can now pledge via our Humble widget which accepts payment via Paypal, Amazon Payments and Google Wallet.\n\nWe also plan to add further tiers at a later date for those who want them, but for now, the focus will be on developing the core aspects of the game, and as before, we want your input to create it. All proceeds will go towards development, and we anticipate being able to release regular updates from Alpha onwards. We will also be keeping you all up-to-date with the latest developments through regular updates and weekly video sit-reps.\n\nWe want to be as transparent as possible, and with this in mind we have broken down the project to allow us to deliver a working version of the game within a shorter timeframe, but as polished as possible.\n\nUltimately, we are so passionate about making Eden Star, no matter what happens it will be completed! We are self-funded and will continue to make what we believe could be something special and fun to play. The more funding we receive, the more of the full scope of the game we can create - so please spread the word!\n\nOnce again, thank you for your support and please remember that under Kickstarter’s terms and conditions you will not be charged for any pledges made on the cancelled kickstarter!\n\nAlso, we'd like to announce that tomorrow, we will be showing the demo at Minecon in Florida!

  "latent_28166": "When you get an iPhone for the first time, one of the things that you probably do right away (after setting it up and such) is look for useful apps to download and install.\n\nThe iTunes App Store has thousands upon thousands of free apps to choose from, and it can be a little difficult to sift through the clutter and find those useful apps.\n\nHowever, we’re here to help and we’ve filled this list with free iPhone apps that we think every user (or most users, at least) will want to download and install on their iPhones.\n\nMany of the these apps might seem like no-brainers, especially if you’re a die-hard user of said apps, but we also included a few selections that you may not have heard of, but they’re still apps that we’d recommend every iPhone user download right now.\n\nWithout further adieu, here are 15 free iPhone apps that you should install right this second.\n\nFacebook\n\nThere are over one billion Facebook users in the world, and chances are you’re one of them. You can easily access Facebook on your iPhone through the web interface using Safari, but the official app is a much better option.\n\nIf you live on Facebook, the Facebook app is something that you should probably download and install right away, as it will allow you to all the things that you can do on your computer, but just on your iPhone this time.\n\nFurthermore, you should also check out Facebook Messenger, which gives you a really nice user interface and makes it a lot easier to chat with friends over Facebook.\n\nFeedly\n\nIt’s nice to have a selection of news and interesting articles on hand to read on your iPhone whenever you have some downtime, and Feedly is one of the best aggregators out there. It’s not necessarily a news source itself, but merely just an app that combines a bunch of different website together (of your choosing) and lets you browse all of the articles in one interface.\n\nFlipboard is another option that we really like, and it comes with a user interface that’s more geared towards those who like a magazine-style interface that’s image heavy and looks good.\n\nGoogle Search\n\nOne of the best features of Android is Google Now, which automatically gives you the information you need throughout your day. You can get the same features with the Google Search app on your iPhone.\n\nOf course, you can also easily conduct Google searches on the app as well, so if Google Now isn’t quite your thing, the app still makes for a pretty sweet search tool.\n\nGoogle Maps\n\nApple Maps is great and all, but Google Maps is simply fleshed out more. Apple Maps is young and will keep growing until it eventually becomes just as good as Google Maps, but until then, we’d recommend using Google Maps.\n\nOf course, you’ll lose integration with other iOS apps and services, like Siri, but you’ll get way more features, like public transit directions and a lot more map information.\n\nBreeze\n\nIt’s important for everyone to get up and exercise for at least a little bit every day. Of course, it’s hard to find a good motivator, but Breeze is a new app that makes it enjoyable to get up and stay active.\n\nBreeze is an app from the makers of RunKeeper and it essentially counts your steps as well as providing you with goals and motivation to meet those goals.\n\nOther similar options that are just as great include Moves (which was recently acquired by Facebook) and Pedometer++, which is a simple and minimalistic step counter.\n\nIMDb\n\nHow many times have you been watching a move or TV show and you either want to learn more about it or you just can’t place the name of that actor or actress? This is where IMDb comes into good use.\n\nThe app has a ton of information on pretty much every TV show or movie you can think of, and it’s almost like a Wikipedia for movies, right on your iPhone.\n\nFlixster\n\nNeed to know when a specific movie is showing at your local theater? Want to read reviews on a new movie that came out before you go see? There’s an app for that, and it’s called Flixster. It allows you to view show times for movies at local movie theaters and even lets you look over reviews so you know whether or not to go see it in the first place.\n\nA good alternative is Fandango, which does many of the same things that Flixster does, and you can also buy movie tickets right from the Fandango app and many movie theater use Fandango anyway as their main online ticket sales platform.\n\nCredit Karma\n\nThere are a lot of apps that help you with your credit card debt and give you goals to pay it down as quickly and efficiently as possible (which we’ll get to soon), but Credit Karma is a little different.\n\nCredit Karma essentially evaluates your current credit score and gives you a report card, grading you on various aspects of your credit score, like credit utilization, payment history, derogatory marks, etc. This allows you to make some changes to some of these categories and hopefully boost your credit score.\n\nMint\n\nHaving a budget is one of the most important things you can have when managing your finances, and one of the most useful iPhone apps that we’ve used when managing our own finances is Mint.\n\nYou can all of your bank accounts to mint and the app will watch each every transaction and even automatically categorize them for you so that you can see where you’re spending the most money and hopefully cut back if you’re looking to save money.\n\nIf it’s credit card debt that you’re trying to get rid of, take a look at ReadyForZero. It’s a free iPhone app that gathers all of your credit card accounts and sets realistic goals for paying them off.\n\nSpotify\n\nEveryone listens to music to some capacity, and while you most likely have a library of music on your computer that you sync to your iPhone, many prefer just to stream it. This is where Spotify comes in handy.\n\nSpotify allows you to create playlists of songs and stream them to your iPhone whenever you want to listen to music. You can also save playlists for offline mode so that you don’t use up data while you’re on the road.\n\nYou can also try Rdio if Spotify isn’t your cup of tea, or give Pandora a run if you prefer internet radio.\n\nNetflix\n\nMovies and TV shows help us rewind at the end of a long day, but if you can’t get near a computer, you can actually get Netflix right on your iPhone.\n\nA Netflix subscription is only $8 per month (although that price will go up slightly in the near future), and with that you can enjoy a plethora of TV shows and movies on demand.\n\nYou can also try out Amazon Instant Video (which requires a $99/year Prime membership) or Hulu Plus, which gives you the latest episodes of TV shows the day after they air for the same price as Netflix.\n\nSoundHound\n\nDon’t you hate in when you’re in a bar or listening to the radio in your car and you can’t put your finger on the name of the song or the artist that’s singing it? It’s a really annoying feeling, but SoundHound is one of our favorite apps that listens to the background music and can name the song and the artist for you.\n\nIt’s almost like black magic, but it works surprisingly well. Shazam is also a good alternative if you don’t like SoundHound’s user interface.\n\nYahoo Weather\n\nThe weather is one thing that every single one of us frequently checks, because it can simply affect how our day might turn out.

(2:14)\n\nOne week after President Donald Trump criticized NFL players for protesting during the national anthem, Americans say they are paying close attention to the story and are divided in their attitudes about the protests.\n\nThe results come from a nationwide online survey of 1,055 adults 18 and older conducted by Global Strategy Group for ESPN. The sampling is representative of country demographics including gender, race, geographic location and political affiliation. The survey included both sports fans and non-sports fans and was conducted from Sept. 26-28. The margin of error for a survey of this sample size is plus or minus 3 percent.\n\nAsked if they approve or disapprove of the recent NFL player protests, 51 percent said they either somewhat or strongly disapprove, compared to 39 percent who did approve. When broken down by race, 72 percent of African-American respondents either strongly approved or somewhat approved of the protests, while 62 percent of whites either somewhat disapproved or strongly disapproved.\n\nSurvey respondents that identified themselves as avid NFL fans were split almost evenly on the protests, with 48 percent strongly or somewhat approving and 47 percent strongly or somewhat disapproving.\n\nGlobal Strategy Group\n\nPeople were also split on whether the protests will affect their interest in the NFL. Among all respondents, 14 percent were more interested and 40 percent were less interested -- with 43 percent saying the protests had no impact on their interest. Among avid NFL fans, 48 percent said their interest is not impacted, but 31 percent said they were less interested in the league because of the protests (19 percent said they were more interested).\n\nGlobal Strategy Group\n\nThe latest protests by sports figures came after President Trump criticized NFL players and owners at a political rally Sept. 22 in Alabama and suggested fans leave stadiums if they see players protesting. In the survey, 58 percent of respondents disapproved of the comments, with 36 percent approving. Among avid NFL fans, 64 percent disapproved and 33 percent approved.\n\nSeventy-eight percent of respondents said they were following the story closely. However, 55 percent said the media is focused too much on the player protests, compared to 29 percent who felt the coverage was right, and 6 percent who felt there was too little. Among fans who consider themselves avid NFL fans, 64 percent feel the media is focusing too much on the story, with 27 percent saying it's just right.\n\nColin Kaepernick, who was the first player to protest last season, would still be in the league if he hadn't protested and spoken up, 53 percent of respondents said. Only 19 percent disagree, with 29 percent unsure. The survey showed 59 percent of Democrats and 51 percent of Republicans agree he would be playing, while 67 percent of African-Americans and 50 percent of whites agree.\n\nGlobal Strategy Group\n\nA slight plurality -- 46 percent to 44 percent -- disagreed with the statement that athletes should stick to sports and avoid politics on the field.\n\nBy a 10-point margin, Americans are more likely to agree that NFL players \"have a right to express their views and should not be punished for protesting during the national anthem\" (49 percent) than to agree that players are \"crossing a line by protesting during the national anthem and should be punished if they keep doing it\" (39 percent). A clear majority of avid NFL fans (58 percent) agree that the players should not be punished, while 34 percent believe they should be punished.",

The developments are also reshaping the commercial mix for the neighborhood with big name brands and new-era retail showcases.\n\nThe next big name to join E Pine, CHS has learned, will be fashion eyewear retailer Warby Parker on a stretch of street that is meshing Capitol Hill development with downtown demographics.\n\nWhile the company has not yet responded to CHS requests for information about the planned store in the eight-story Excelsior building at Melrose and Pine, permits show plans for a $388,000 buildout of a new eyeglass shop, the third Warby Parker store in Seattle.\n\nThe building is already home to a showcase cafe and retail experience from global cycling brand Rapha and a mix of retailers including local concept Stock and Pantry, an Aesop, and an outlet of the Pressed Juicery chain.\n\nMeanwhile, another of the huge preservation boosted developments higher on the Hill is readying a commercial mix that melds the brand showcase concept with the area’s food and drink economy. The Pike Motorworks building by “late summer” will be home to a showcase brewery and beer pub — a major investment from big beer brand Redhook with complicated engineering that has delayed the project by months.

Up E Pine, “contemporary furniture retailer” Blu Dot is also readying plans to join the area in the overhauled auto row-era building formerly home to Area 51.\n\nBack at the Excelsior, more brands are lining up. The building’s latest opening is a new store from beach fashion outfit Marine Layer, the second Seattle location for the San Francisco-based brand. “In the old days, our general strategy for expansion was to open stores in cool places our 1969 VW bus would take us,” Marine Layer’s marketing copy reads. “Then we opened up a store in Chicago and the bus broke down halfway across the Bay Bridge, so we had to reevaluate. Now we just open stores in fun towns that we need an excuse to visit.”\n\nThanks for visiting Capitol Hill.",
  "latent_28492": "A recent report from the UK's Academy of Medical Royal Colleges described ‘the miracle cure’ of performing 30 min of moderate exercise, five times a week, as more powerful than many drugs administered for chronic disease prevention and management.1 Regular physical activity reduces the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dementia and some cancers by at least 30%. However, physical activity does not promote weight loss.\n\nIn the past 30 years, as obesity has rocketed, there has been little change in physical activity levels in the Western population.2 This places the blame for our expanding waist lines directly on the type and amount of calories consumed. However, the obesity epidemic represents only the tip of a much larger iceberg of the adverse health consequences of poor diet. According to The Lancet global burden of disease reports, poor diet now generates more disease than physical inactivity, alcohol and smoking combined. Up to 40% of those with a normal body mass index will harbour metabolic abnormalities typically associated with obesity, which include hypertension, dyslipidaemia, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and cardiovascular disease.3 However, this is little appreciated by scientists, doctors, media writers and policymakers, despite the extensive scientific literature on the vulnerability of all ages and all sizes to lifestyle-related diseases.\n\nInstead, members of the public are drowned by an unhelpful message about maintaining a ‘healthy weight’ through calorie counting, and many still wrongly believe that obesity is entirely due to lack of exercise. This false perception is rooted in the Food Industry's Public Relations machinery, which uses tactics chillingly similar to those of big tobacco. The tobacco industry successfully stalled government intervention for 50 years starting from when the first links between smoking and lung cancer were published. This sabotage was achieved using a ‘corporate playbook’ of denial, doubt and confusing the public.4\n\nCoca Cola, who spent $3.3 billion on advertising in 2013, pushes a message that ‘all calories count’; they associate their products with sport, suggesting it is ok to consume their drinks as long as you exercise. However science tells us this is misleading and wrong. It is where the calories come from that is crucial. Sugar calories promote fat storage and hunger. Fat calories induce fullness or ‘satiation’.\n\nA large econometric analysis of worldwide sugar availability, revealed that for every excess 150 calories of sugar, there was an 11-fold increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes, in comparison to an identical 150 calories obtained from fat or protein. And this was independent of the person's weight and physical activity level; this study fulfils the Bradford Hill Criteria for causation.5 A recently published critical review in nutrition concluded that dietary carbohydrate restriction is the single most effective intervention for reducing all the features of the metabolic syndrome and should be the first approach in diabetes management, with benefits occurring even without weight loss.6\n\nAnd what about carbohydrate loading for exercise? The twin rationales for carbohydrate loading are that the body has a limited capacity to store carbohydrates and these are essential for more intense exercise. However, recent studies suggest otherwise. The work of Volek and colleagues7 establishes that chronic adaptation to a high-fat low-carbohydrate diet induces very high rates of fat oxidation during exercise (up to 1.5 g/min)—sufficient for most exercisers in most forms of exercise—without the need for added carbohydrate. Thus fat, including ketone bodies, appears to be the ideal fuel for most exercise—it is abundant, does not need replacement or supplementation during exercise, and can fuel the forms of exercise in which most participate.7 If a high-carbohydrate diet was merely unnecessary for exercise it would be of little threat to public health, however, there are growing concerns that insulin-resistant athletes may be at risk of developing type 2 diabetes if they continue to eat very high-carbohydrate diets for decades since such diets worsen insulin resistance.\n\nThe ‘health halo’ legitimisation of nutritionally deficient products must end The public health messaging around diet and exercise, and their relationship to the epidemics of type 2 diabetes and obesity, has been corrupted by vested interests. Celebrity endorsements of sugary drinks, and the association of junk food and sport, must end. The ‘health halo’ legitimisation of nutritionally deficient products is misleading and unscientific. This manipulative marketing sabotages effective government interventions such as the introduction of sugary drink taxes or the banning of junk food advertising. Such marketing increases commercial profit at the cost of population health. The Centres of Disease Control health impact pyramid is clear. Changing the food environment—so that individuals’ choices about what to eat default to healthy options—will have a far greater impact on population health than counselling or education. Healthy choice must become the easy choice. Health clubs and gyms therefore also need to set an example by removing the sale of sugary drinks and junk food from their premises. It is time to wind back the harms caused by the junk food industry's public relations machinery. Let us bust the myth of physical inactivity and obesity. You cannot outrun a bad diet.",

  "latent_28599": "Last week, Texas approved a new law that will require abortion providers to either bury or cremate and scatter fetal remains. The law, proposed in July at the behest of Governor Greg Abbott, will change the longstanding medical practice of disposing of fetal remains in a sanitary landfill along with other biological waste. The rule, which will go into effect on December 19th, mandates burial or cremation for fetal remains regardless of gestation period.\n\nGovernor Abbott, in an email published by The Texas Tribune, stated “I believe it is imperative to establish higher standards that reflect our respect for the sanctity of life. This is why Texas will require clinics and hospitals to bury or cremate human and fetal remains.” The law apparently removes the distinction between “human and fetal remains,” treating both, at least in practice, as fully human remains.\n\nCritics of the law, including NARAL Pro-Choice Texas and the Texas Medical Association, argue that the new rules constitute a blatant attempt to restrict access to abortion and stigmatize women who choose to have the procedure. As Emily Crockett at Vox points out, the law, which is the first one in the country to mandate burial or cremation for fetal remains, is likely to dramatically increase the cost of an abortion.\n\nThe news of the law had me wondering, what is the larger Jewish discussion around abortion?\n\nI spoke to Rabbi Scott Perlo of Washington D.C.‘s Sixth and I Synagogue over the phone to get a better idea of how the Jewish community perceives abortion. According to Rabbi Perlo, the “Jewish abortion conversation seems to be significantly healthier than the abortion conversation that afflicts America… We don’t have the same kind of absolutist understanding of what a fetus or a baby is.” For starters, in Jewish law life does not begin at conception. A fetus is not considered a person until it has been begun to emerge from the mother’s body, and is considered to be “mere fluid” until 40 days after conception – though, Rabbi Perlo clarified that the fetus is still “considered to be an important part of the mother.”\n\nMuch of the current Jewish understanding on abortion and the status of a fetus stems from interpretations of two passages in the book of Exodus that outline the penalties for striking a pregnant woman. Rashi, one of Judaism’s most famous biblical interpreters, understands the passage to mean that if the woman is struck and the result is a miscarriage, then a monetary penalty will be imposed. If the woman is killed however, then “a life for a life” kicks in. Rabbis have widely interpreted this passage, and Rashi’s response, to mean that a fetus is not afforded the same status as a living person – hence the discrepancy in penalty.\n\nAs with any Jewish law, there are rabbinic disagreements as to when abortion is permitted, but in general, abortion is permitted only when it is certain or highly probable that carrying the fetus to term or childbirth would constitute a direct threat to the life of the mother. It is interesting to note that both physical and psychological factors can come into play regarding the well being of a potential mother, however the debate on what psychological factors would constitute a substantial threat is far less settled than the debate surrounding physical factors.\n\nAll abortions, regardless of reason or term, are subject to the Texas law, so the question naturally arises for those interested in the Jewish rules on abortion: how would a Jewish burial of an aborted fetus look?\n\nWell, once again, it depends who you ask. Rabbi Perlo informed me that there is still a deep halakhic discussion regarding whether one has to bury a miscarriage or abortion, though the general consensus appears to come down against mandated burial.\n\nIn Jewish law, the rites of mourning are only applicable after the first 30 days of life. The most likely reason behind the rule is that, back in biblical times, infant mortality rates were high and viability could not be reasonably assured until after the first month of life. Therefore, the full Jewish burial ceremony, which requires ritual washing and a guard for the casket among other things, is not required for fetuses (It is also, in many cases, logistically impossible).\n\nThough the full ceremony is not required, Jewish law does require the burial of “a formed fetus from the end of the fifth month” according to a paper published by the Rabbinical Assembly. The fetus is supposed to be wrapped in a white sheet, placed in a kosher coffin, and buried in a Jewish cemetery – but that is where the ritual stops. (These requirements were originally just for stillbirths, but the Assembly believes that they ought to extend to third trimester abortions as well.) Some strains of thought say that this ceremony (or something like it) may be carried out for fetuses of less than five months for the comfort of the parents, while others maintain that to acknowledge a fetus of less than five months with any kind of ritual burial or mourning is forbidden by law.\n\nSo in terms of the Texas law, mandated burial is not necessarily in conflict or agreement with Jewish law. In the absence of any ritual, it’s just a Judaically neutral imposition upon abortion providers. If, however, a Jewish Texan would like to perform the truncated fetal burial ritual, it is well within the bounds of Jewish law for them to do so.\n\nJake Romm is the Forward’s culture intern.

In Bukhara, two Jehovah's Witnesses were jailed for ten days and, with 28 others, fined for \"illegal\" literature and worship meeting.\n\nis credited as the source.\n\nPolice in Urgench [Urganch] in Uzbekistan's north-western Khorezm Region appear about to hand to court a criminal case against a local Baptist to punish him for \"illegal possession\" of religious literature in his home. Stanislav Kim could face up to three years' imprisonment if convicted. The Investigator who prepared the indictment refused to tell Forum 18 if Nikolai Serin, another Baptist questioned as a witness in the case, also faces prosecution. Courts routinely punish people for \"illegal\" religious literature as well as holding meetings for worship.Khorezm authorities also raided a Baptist worship meeting in February. In late March the host and her non-believing husband were fined for possessing \"illegal\" literature in their home when the meeting was raided.Meanwhile in the southern Bukhara Region on 27 January, 30 Jehovah's Witnesses were punished for meeting for worship and possessing religious literature officials claimed was \"illegal\". They received fines totalling more than 1,050 times the minimum monthly wage or 136,752,000 Soms (390,000 Norwegian Kroner, 42,000 Euros or 47,000 US Dollars at the inflated official exchange rate). Two of the Jehovah's Witnesses - Andrei and Yelena Yu - were fined 30 times the minimum monthly wage each and given 10-day jail terms for exercising their freedom of religion and belief.Against its international human rights obligations, Uzbekistan imposes strict censorship on all religious publications and all aspects of their distribution. There is a de facto ban on religious literature of any faith in homes and if found such literature is frequently ordered to be destroyed. State pressure is so great that for their own safety some religious believers have destroyed their own sacred texts (see Forum 18's Uzbekistan religious freedom survey http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=1862 ).Imprisonment for religious literature?On 27 June Investigator Lieutenant Sarvar Artykov of Urgench City Police in Khorezm Region prepared and signed the indictment (seen by Forum 18) against local Baptist Stanislav Kim. He is accused of \"illegal possession\" of Christian literature under Criminal Code Article 244-3.Article 244-3 punishes \"Illegal production, storage, import into the territory of Uzbekistan with a purpose to distribute or distribution of religious materials, committed after enforcement of an administrative penalty for a similar violation\" with a fine of 100 to 200 times the minimum monthly wage or corrective labour of up to three years.\"The Investigator warned us that Stanislav might be fined or even jailed for up to three years,\" Nikolai Serin, Kim's fellow-Baptist from Navoi Region, told Forum 18 on 27 June. Police told Serin and Kim that Urgench City Court will hear the case in up to fifteen days (by about 10 July), Serin added.Both Kim and Serin are members of separate Council of Churches Baptist congregations. Council of Churches Baptist churches do not – as Uzbekistan against its human rights obligations requires – seek state permission to exist (see Forum 18's Uzbekistan religious freedom survey http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=1862 ).Urgench Police questioned Serin on 26 June as a witness in the case, he noted. On 19 June Police in Navoi had already raided his home there and confiscated his Christian books. Navoi Police told him that a case had been opened against him under Administrative Code Article 184-2, which punishes \"Illegal production, storage, import or distribution of religious materials\" with a fine for individuals of 20 to 100 times the minimum monthly wage, as well as confiscation of the materials and any equipment used to produce them.\"We've done nothing criminal, but only exercised our Constitutional rights which allow us peacefully to practice our faith, which does no harm to anyone,\" Serin insisted to Forum 18. He said that when he told Investigator Artykov, who is leading the case, that he refuses to be a witness, the Investigator warned him that \"I also may be punished with up to three years' imprisonment unless I cooperate with the Police.\"Serin did not sign any Police reports or statements prepared by Urgench Police during questioning either on 17 May or 26 June, he told Forum 18.\"Extremist\"?Investigator Artykov argues in the 27 June indictment that the materials found in Kim's home \"contain ideas of converting believers of one confession to another, which is against Article 5, Part 3 of the Religion Law\". He concludes therefore that Kim \"stored illegal religious materials in his private flat\".The indictment says that among the items officers seized from Kim was a Russian-language book \"Alone to Mecca\", which \"propagates the Protestant religion\". The book is a \"testimony of a former [non-Uzbek] Muslim man who became a Christian\", Serin told Forum 18. He confirmed that Kim had a copy.The \"expert analysis\" by the government's Religious Affairs Committee says that the book \"does not contain ideas against Uzbekistan's Constitutional order, or of an extremist or separatist nature\". But it claims that the book \"can be used for missionary purposes\", Serin noted.Arslan Ruzimov, Chief of Khorezm Regional Police Criminal Investigation Department, adamantly defended the charges against Kim. Asked on 28 June why the authorities want to imprison him, he told Forum 18 from Urgench: \"The religious expert analysis found the materials confiscated from Kim to be extremist.\"Told that the confiscated literature consisted of Christian magazines, children's stories, song-books and Kim's personal notes, and asked what specifically is \"extremist\" in those materials, Ruzimov could not answer. \"They have a lawyer, they can ask him to defend them,\" he retorted. Asked why Serin was pressured to be a witness against Kim, his co-believer, he did not answer. He then declined to talk to Forum 18.Investigator Artykov also used a July 2001 conviction in a non-religious criminal case to justify the unrelated new case. Kim was sentenced that year to 20 years' imprisonment as an alleged accomplice in an intentional killing. Artykov argues that although Kim was freed from his sentence, \"he continued violating the Law\".Serin told Forum 18 that Kim was released from prison in 2009, and that \"he became a believer while in prison.\" He said that \"it looks like the authorities want to imprison him again, which is why they bring up his criminal conviction from the past in the indictment.\"Investigator Artykov told Forum 18 on 28 June that the case against Kim has not yet been handed to the Court, but refused to answer Forum 18's other questions. Asked whether any charges were brought against Serin, as well as why a criminal case was opened against Kim simply for having Christian books and materials in his home, Artykov replied: \"If you want to know the answers then send your representative to our office. I will not answer your questions over the phone.\" Artykov also did not say when the Police will refer the case to the Court.Why criminal charges?The indictment explains that police opened a criminal case against Kim because this is the second case against him within one year for possessing \"illegal\" religious literature.Urgench City Criminal Court fined Kim ten times the minimum monthly wage, 1,184,000 Soms, on 8 August 2015 under Administrative Code Article 184-2, according to the June 2016 indictment. The Court ordered part of the Christian literature confiscated from him to be destroyed and the rest to be handed over to the Khorezm Department of the state-backed Muslim Board.The fine followed a 20 July 2015 raid on Kim's home (see F18News 6 August 2015 http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=2087 ).Secret police and anti-terrorism police raid and confiscationsThe latest trouble began for Kim on 17 May, when Major Shukhrat Masharipov of Urgench Anti-Terrorism Police and two unidentified officers raided his home in the city, Serin told Forum 18. The indictment indicates that the two officers represented the National Security Service (NSS) secret police. The officers pretended to be conducting a passport inspection.Without showing a search warrant, officers confiscated Christian literature, including the book \"Alone to Mecca\", one copy each of \"Herald of Truth\" magazine, two Baptist song books (\"Hold on to Christ\" and \"Youth for Christ\"), a book of Christian children's stories, and several notebooks with personal notes.Serin told Forum 18 that he was present during the Police raid on Kim's home, since he happened to be visiting him that day.Six hour interrogationOfficer Masharipov and the other officers took Kim's and Serin's passports and left, demanding that the two appear at Urgench Police Station the next morning.On 18 May, Major Masharipov and Police Investigator Shavkat Bekjanov questioned the two Baptists for six hours, Serin told Forum 18. \"They suggested that we write statements but we refused.\" The Police told the Baptists that as Kim had been found for the second time \"illegally possessing\" Christian literature in his home, this time he may be jailed. The two were released from the Police Station that evening.February Khorezm raid and finesOn 17 February in Gullanbog, in Yangiaryk District of Khorezm Region, two plain-clothes Anti-Terrorism Police officers and the local ordinary police officer raided the home of Oybek and Gulnara Rahimov as 15 Council of Churches Baptists were meeting for worship.\"When the local police officer saw we were worshipping, he called for a police squad,\" Baptists told Forum 18 on 15 April. Police then began filming those present and took down their names. Police also confiscated a Bible, a children's Bible, one other Christian book and two Baptist song-books.All the meeting participants were taken to Yangiaryk District Police Station, where they were questioned for three hours.Oybek Rahimov is not a Baptist and was not at home during the raid. But that did not stop Judge Yerpolat Berdiyev, Chair of Bogot District Criminal Court, on 22 March fining both wife and husband 10 times the minimum monthly wage each. Baptists have particularly expressed outrage at the fine imposed on Oybek.Judge Berdiyev also ordered the destruction of Christian literature confiscated from the Rahimovs' home. Courts frequently order that such confiscated religious literature be destroyed (see Forum 18's Uzbekistan religious freedom survey http://www.forum18.org/archive.php?article_id=1862 ).Asked why the Baptists were raided, Bogot District Police on 8 June referred Forum 18 to Anti-Terrorism Police officer Dilshot Fayzullayev. However, asked the same day why officers conducted the raid, fines and confiscations, he refused to answer.Neither Bogot District Court, nor Judge Berdiyev, answered their phones on 9 June.Two short-term prisoners of conscience, 30 large finesMeanwhile, in Kogon in Bukhara [Bukhoro] Region on 27 January, 30 Jehovah's Witnesses received fines totalling more than 1,050 times the minimum monthly wage or 136,752,000 Soms (390,000 Norwegian Kroner, 42,000 Euros or 47,000 US Dollars at the inflated official exchange rate). Two of the Jehovah's Witnesses - Andrei and Yelena Yu - were fined 30 times the minimum monthly wage each and given 10-day jail terms for exercising their freedom of religion and belief.The fines and jailing of the two prisoners of conscience followed an early January raid by Kogon Anti-Terrorism Police and the ordinary police on the home of Aziz Pulatov. Jehovah's Witnesses were meeting together for worship, they told Forum 18 on 8 June.Numon Tukhtayev, Deputy Head of Kogon Anti-Terrorism Police, refused on 8 June to explain why the raid took place. The same day the ordinary police similarly refused to explain their actions.Judge Zarif Sherov, Chair of Kogon Criminal Court, found the accused guilty under Administrative Code Articles 184-2 (\"Illegal production, storage, or import into Uzbekistan, with the intent to distribute or actual distribution, of religious materials by physical persons\") and Article 240 (\"Violation of the Religion Law\"), Part 1 (\"Carrying out of unauthorised religious activity, evasion by leaders of religious organisations of registration of the charter of the organisation, and the organisation and conduct of special children's and youth meetings, as well as vocational, literature and other study groups not relating to worship\").Aziz Pulatov and Fazliddin Tukhtayev were fined 100 times the minimum monthly wage each; Akpar Pulatov, Shahzoda Pulatova, Mukaddas Rakhmatova, Zuhra Tashayeva, and Malyuda Kuldasheva were fined 50 times the minimum monthly wage each; Shahnoz Gulomova, Shahzoda Mavlyanova, Mukhabbatkhon Mirzayeva, Mokhidil Zairova, Gulnora Norova, Dilfuza Kobilova, Orom Khaydarova, Soliya Niyazova, Mahliyo Zhurayeva, Ibodillo Zhurayev, Gulchehra Ibadova, Shoista Mamedova, Shahin Norov, Zarina Kosimova, Munavvar Mardonova, Azamzhon Ismatilloyev, Farida Amonova, and Zarina Amonova were fined 30 times the minimum monthly wage each; and Gulbahor Mavlonova, Nilufar Ibrohimova, and Mizhgona Ismatillayeva were fined 5 times the minimum monthly wage each.Judge Sherov denied that he had jailed prisoners of conscience Andrei and Yelena Yu. \"I do not know about the jailing,\" he claimed to Forum 18 on 9 June.However, the Judge admitted that he had imposed fines totalling 1,050 times the minimum monthly wage. Asked why he did this to people exercising their freedom of religion and belief, Sherov stated: \"I explained to them during the hearing that the fines were given based on the existing law.\"Asked about the restrictions the Religion Law, Administrative and Criminal Codes put on the exercise of freedom of religion and belief, the Judge replied: \"I cannot comment on that\". He then said \"let them appeal if they do not agree with our decision\" before declining to talk further to Forum 18.

  "latent_29041": "When Larry Shyatt appeared to be the only assistant heading out the door, Florida Gators head coach Billy Donovan said he wanted to replace him with someone young. Learning over a 40-hour period that his entire staff would be leaving less than a month after reaching the Elite Eight in the 2011 NCAA Tournament, he decided to turn to a friendly face and a familiar colleague.\n\nFor Donovan, it was not a stretch to hire the two men he turned to right away. A six-year assistant under Donovan, former Arkansas head coach John Pelphrey brings stability and familiarity to the bench, while former St. Johns head coach Norm Roberts offers experience and vast amounts of knowledge. Both are excellent recruiters and respected coaches who will provide the team with a steadiness and sense of continuity even though the entire staff will be changing.\n\nWhen you hear Donovan’s contemporaries rave about him, they not only discuss his ability to draw up plays, create game plans or scout opponents. They point to his character, management style and sterling reputation. That is why, before Shyatt was even out the door, Donovan had plenty of options on who he could hire to replace him.\n\n[EXPAND Click to expand and read the remainder of this column.]“There’s a lot of good coaches out there,” he said Tuesday. “The one thing that’s been somewhat overwhelming and really positive is the amount of interest there’s been, especially when Larry left.”\n\nDonovan is the type of coach who is not only concerned about winning basketball games but also making sure he develops his players on and off the court. He does the same thing for his assistants.\n\nHis track record helping assistants find head coaching jobs is unmistakable. The loyalty his former players and coaches show to him is unwavering. Donovan’s character and demeanor are why guys he has sent off to the NBA or others he has helped compete with him for honors like SEC Coach of the Year still refer back to him with high levels of gratitude and appreciation.\n\n“My job, my responsibility is to help these kids grow, put them in a competitive situation to try to win something, teach them something through winning,” he said with a gleam in his eye. “And then also staff-wise, I’ve been fortunate enough to be a part of a lot of guys whose lives got changed in a lot of different ways.”\n\nThose traits he possesses are why – if he calls – Arkansas assistant Brett Nelson or Florida Atlantic assistant Matt McCall would probably fight it out to fill the third position on his new staff. They are why it took promises of coach-in-waiting positions from Texas and Louisville, respectively, to get Rob Lanier and Richard Pitino to leave his side.\n\n“That’s one thing about this profession. Sometimes you never know about timing and opportunities,” Donovan said Tuesday.\n\nOne former assistant faced with a great opportunity was Shaka Smart, who was offered the VCU head coaching job after 10 months under Donovan. He was going back-and-forth about accepting the position because of the respect he had for his boss.\n\n“I don’t think Shaka or I ever anticipated him leaving as quickly as he did. Obviously VCU made a great hire. When you get really good people, there’s going to be opportunities,” Donovan said. “There’s a difference when guys are out seeking and hunting jobs. I’ve been very fortunate that the guys I’ve had here haven’t done that.\n\n“To tell you what kind of guy Shaka Smart is, he almost didn’t take the VCU [job] because he felt so guilty only being here 10 months. I pushed him out the door because I told him it was a great job and he needed to go. If he didn’t do it, he wouldn’t have experienced what he did this year.”\n\nPerhaps most importantly, those characteristics Donovan possesses are why he can lose his entire staff in a matter of days and fill his two main assistant positions with top-notch former head coaches without so much as batting an eye.[/EXPAND]",

Photograph: Supplied\n\nLabor expressed outrage at the “utterly inappropriate” use of defence force assets and demanded an explanation of any approvals provided. The defence minister, Marise Payne, distanced herself from the scandal, saying her office and the Navy had no knowledge of the “regrettable” fundraising proposal.\n\nBrown issued a statement on Thursday confirming the 15 January fundraiser had been cancelled. He blamed “internal excitement” within the WA Nationals.\n\nLabor moves into election-winning position in Western Australia Read more\n\n“Shortly after the invitation was sent out [over the Christmas period], our own internal processes determined that holding a fundraiser on commonwealth property would not be appropriate, and we immediately cancelled the event,” he said.\n\n“Time constraints and our own internal excitement led to an oversight in judgment, which we corrected at our earliest opportunity.”\n\nBrown said the error occurred after he purchased a package – which included a tour of HMAS Perth, the use of a flight simulator and a group lunch – at a Royal Flying Doctor Service fundraising event.\n\nHe bought the package “in good faith” and intended “to put it to use in a positive way”. He now acknowledges the political fundraiser was not an appropriate way to use the package, and his new plan was to invite disadvantaged families to join him on HMAS Perth.\n\nPayne said her office had no knowledge of the event.\n\n“I am advised that Navy was not informed that the event, which was originally auctioned to raise money for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, was being billed as a political fundraiser,” the defence minister said on Thursday.\n\n“Defence facilities should not be used for political fundraising purposes and it is regrettable that the original invitation was issued.”\n\nState and federal Labor MPs criticised the proposal.\n\nThe federal opposition’s acting defence spokeswoman, Gai Brodtmann, asked who knew about the fundraiser, who authorised it and when it was approved.\n\n“It is utterly inappropriate for such an event to be held on any ADF facility or asset and the defence minister must explain how this could be allowed to happen,” she said.\n\nThe WA Labor spokesman on defence issues, Paul Papalia, said the episode was “an absolute disgrace” and called for an inquiry.\n\n“A non-partisan apolitical defence force is a central pillar of the Australian democracy,” he said. “Everyone knows that, the military know it, it appears though that the National Party of Western Australia just don’t have a clue.”",
  "latent_29588": "Peter Quillin will defend his WBO middleweight title against Gabriel Rosado, and Deontay Wilder also looks likely to return on the October 26 Showtime card, with Bernard Hopkins headlining against Karo Murat at Boardwalk Hall in Atlantic City.\n\nQuillin (29-0, 21 KO) has fought just once this year, predictably dominating Fernando Guerrero in April in his first defense of the title that he won last October from Hassan N'dam. Rosado (21-6, 13 KO) has fought twice in 2013, losing to Gennady Golovkin in January on HBO, and then to J'Leon Love on the Mayweather-Guerrero undercard on May 4. That loss was changed to a no-contest when Love failed a drug test, and plenty of people felt Rosado deserved the win in the first place, though the fight was more competitive and debatable than a robbery.\n\nRichard Schaefer likes the fight:\n\n\"Rosado always comes to fight and he's getting another world title opportunity. For Quillin, it's another opportunity to showcase his talents against a good opponent.\"\n\nIf I'm being 100% honest, I don't think a lot of the matchup myself, but I'll always be happy for a guy like Rosado getting chances like this instead of someone who is either shot or just not any good, but with a fluffy record. It's a credible enough fight, basically. Quillin is a bit limited for opponents given his relationship with Al Haymon and Golden Boy, meaning he has to fight on Showtime, and can't fight anyone from Top Rank, and all the other nonsense.\n\nWilder (29-0, 29 KO) will look to go 30-for-30, probably against some old nerd or whatever. There's no reason to have him fight a contender, nor is there really a contender available to be third from the top on a Showtime card in six weeks. Schaefer is hammering nails into the coffin by comparing Wilder to Seth Mitchell:\n\n\"I do think that the Atlantic City, New Jersey and New York fight crowd can certainly fall in love with Deontay Wilder, just like they fell in love with Seth Mitchell.\"\n\nSchaefer also says that these are all \"significant fights.\" You could argue that.",

With no nearby mines accessible, he boarded a flight for the West Coast, where he collected ocean water, boiled it down for six hours, then baked it to form salt.\n\nRelated: 9 over-the-top sandwich recipes you need to try\n\nAnd that wasn't even the most difficult part of the entire process.\n\n\"Making the vegetable oil was a bit more complicated than I originally thought. I grew my own sunflowers for that, but I didn’t realize how much pressure I’d need to extract the oil from the seeds and ended up building my own press,\" he explained.\n\nHow to Make Everything\n\nAll of his hard work did result in an edible sandwich, but it wasn't necessarily a delicious one. One of the final videos shows George conducting a taste test with friends and family. He made one out of store-bought ingredients to see how his truly from-scratch ingredients stacked up. The outcome?\n\nStory: 14,000 people are on a waitlist for these gummy bears\n\n\"My homegrown vegetables tasted a lot better than store bought ones and the pickles were pretty good, but they were soggy. I think it was the cheese and mayo that threw off the sandwich the most,\" he concluded.\n\nHow to Make Everything\n\nThis experience has given George a new-found appreciation for not just farmers and artisans, but also for food-makers at all levels.\n\n\"I respect that I can go into the store and buy this ready-made stuff so I don’t have to do it, but also enjoy the do-it-yourself experience and respect the people who want to make it on their own,\" he says.\n\nGeorge is tackling a few other items (like a full suit), before he jumps on more edible items — the adventurous DIY expert plans to crowd-source funds for a trip to Mexico, where he can learn to make coffee and chocolate.",
  "latent_29735": "President Donald Trump pulled America out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership on Monday, abandoning the trade deal he spent much of the presidential campaign deriding.\n\nLongtime TPP critics like Bernie Sanders applauded the move. But, surprisingly, the decision was also praised by Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan — one of the congressional leaders who had been most willing to support President Barack Obama’s controversial trade deal.\n\n“President Trump is wasting no time acting on his promises … He has followed through on his promise to insist on better trade agreements,” Ryan said in a statement lauding Trump’s decision on Monday. “We look forward to working with the president to build on these actions and deliver results for the people.\"\n\nAs critics were quick to point out, Ryan’s new position certainly appears at odds with his old one. Ryan’s website, for instance, still says approving the international trade deal is one of his top five priorities. This summer, Ryan extolled the importance of conservative free market principles in a speech widely viewed as a rebuke to Trump’s skepticism of global trade deals. Last year, the speaker led the charge for Congress to approve the TPA, which gave Obama broader authority to negotiate with the Pacific Rim countries. (As his spokesperson points out, Ryan had raised specific objections with some aspects of the TPP trade deal, but hadn’t argued for jettisoning the entire package.)\n\n“I just think it would be a big mistake for our country if we were to fail to do this,” Ryan told Politico at the time. “Trade is very important; it’s about time that this administration gets around to it. Forget our party. This is important for our country.”\n\nWill congressional Republicans stand up to Trump?\n\nNow, in terms of practical consequences for actual policy, Ryan’s backflip on the TPP won’t have much of an impact.\n\nThe TPP has long been dead. House and Senate Democrats turned on it overwhelmingly over the course of the campaign, making it politically toxic. Even Hillary Clinton, who once praised it, later firmly turned against TPP on the campaign trail. Trump seemed likely to kill it once in office — with or without Ryan’s support.\n\nWhat’s more important to note is not what Ryan’s decision means for the TPP itself, but what it suggests for how he and other congressional Republicans are hoping to work with Trump.\n\nOn Monday, Utah Sen. Orrin Hatch also downplayed any real difference on TPP between the Republicans in congress and Trump. Hatch argued that Trump’s real aim was to change the TPP so it was negotiated on a “bilateral basis” (between the US and one other country at a time), but that his decision didn’t reflect a deeper philosophical divide within the party over what the individual deals should look like.\n\n“All the president is saying is that he wants to look at it on a bilateral basis, and I'm prepared to go ahead on the bilateral basis,” Hatch told me in an interview. “I think it would be easier for him if he'd modify TPP — which concerns 11 nations plus ours — but if we have to do them individually, that's fine with me.”\n\nSimilarly, other Republican members of congress who had backed TPP aren’t slamming Trump for appearing to kill the trade pact. Kevin Brady, of Texas, who had extolled TPP as recently as November 2016, released a statement on Monday expressing faith Trump would “build on the work that has been done.”\n\n“I believe the TPP agreement contains considerable benefits for the U.S. economy — but it fell short in other ways,” said Republican Ways and Means Committee chair . “It's important that America not abandon the Asia-Pacific region because American companies and workers will lose out.”\n\nRepublicans in congress need Trump to sign their legislation. Not picking a fight with Trump for pulling out of the TPP — given that the measure was probably dead anyway — is an easy way for them to try to win goodwill with the new president, even if it opens him up to accusations of hypocrisy.",

  "latent_29964": "A glimpse into Venezuelan Death Metal: Baphometh, Epitafio, Natastor & Krueger Share:\n\nWhen you hear about Venezuela, you probably think about crazy presidents, good food, beauty contests, or the biggest waterfall ever. Those are shallow clichés (except for the food, the food is good), and now I’m here to tell you a story about a few bands that developed our metal scene.\n\nVenezuela is a country deeply rooted in a mixed-race region. The Spanish, ethnic tribes, and African Americans converged here since the foundation of this glorious nation. This racial and cultural mix developed a refined musical sense of rhythm and melody: the Venezuelan music drank from the European waltz, the magic of the left indigenous tribes and the hypnotic percussion of the slaves from Africa.\n\nWhen metal came here in the mid-70s, there were a few bands that tried to push a little more the genre infusing those sources. It is sad, because those interesting mixes that could be fused with the genre were lost because most of the first bands looked more to the outside than the inside of our problems and culture. Nevertheless, there are still a few attempts of what we can call an original approach to metal.\n\nWhile the Floridian, New York and Swedish death metal scene started to become a force in the underground music; in Venezuela the bands were still making the NWOHM style. Everything came late to the country because the Metal was a tiny niche that was not very prolific, did not have too much promotion and the country had a Black Friday, an economic breakout, which deteriorated the currency.\n\nI’d like to pause to share some findings* about the ‘self-stereotypes’ of Venezuelan habitants, just to give you a global vision of the music scene, the motivations and the reason why the death metal scene got these big four exponents, I will short this part, no worries. According to the investigation of Montero (1984), the Venezuelan validates positively the North Americans, English and Spanish more than they, and the self-perception were qualified by the people interviewed as: happy, generous, intelligent; and, even impulsive, irresponsible and lazy. The research of Montero is wider, but I wanted to rescue those adjectives because they were the most generals for us to understand the culture of the country.\n\nWhen we enter the 90, we can say that Venezuela was in bad shape due the bad governments, deteriorated economics and the grotesque division between the rich and the poor. The violence and the popular turmoil finished in one massive riot with deaths and disappearing of the protesters, and attempt of coup d’état in 1992.\n\nFrom a chronological sense, the first band that was tagged as death metal was Stratuz. But, they did not make a bigger impact of the scene like what Baphometh did with their demos.\n\nBaphometh was a band formed in Caracas that blended a fast thrash/death metal a la Brazilian style. Sepultura and Sarcófago were, in fact, the biggest influence in the Venezuelan extreme scene because they were perceived as a role model due the geographical proximity, contributions and their international projection.\n\nIn 1988, Baphometh recorded their first demo with just one song and the famous pentacle in the cover. I cannot imagine how the reaction to this was, it was primal and evil; and the metal in Venezuela was not prepared and used to this imagery. But, the success on the underground tape trading was there and, in 1992, they created Ars Moriendi with all the experience they accumulated, when they toured all around the country bringing their maniac music.\n\nThe bark vocal approach, the rumbling bass behind and the violent lyrics sung in English were a hit and opened the scene for the other groups. They quitted in 1993 without any recorded LP, but their roads travelled bring courage to other groups to start a scene. In 2014, they reformed for a last final couple of shows and their leader, Franklin Zambrano, exhumed their famous demos for free in Bandcamp in a compilation titled In the Beginning.\n\nBaphometh’ comrades in death, Natastor, formed in La Güaira, near Caracas, in 1991 and were faster and darker, and while they were more leaned to the thrash metal, they incorporated distorted vocals to the double bass rampage. Their topics were more focused in blasphemy and destruction, a sign of the dark times of a country without direction and drowning more and more in the individualistic capitalist system.\n\nThe guys from Natastor created music very compact and direct. Center in the evilness of their sound, they influenced a lot of new bands because they transmitted their shows with high energy, and teached the other bands of the importance of the live setting. Their only full-length was released in 2005. You can taste a little of their project with the song “Regreso Del Abismo”:\n\nEpitafio was the other band that spawned more death metal in the country. Created in the city of Maracay, in 1992, these guys were pal of the Baphometh crew and accompanied them in the road, too. Like Natastor, they made their LP in the 2000’s, because the tape trade was the easiest and cheapest way to share music in the 90’s.\n\nTalking about general death metal topics, like death and gore, Epitafio was an example to the scene because they encourage more bands to tour. They quitted, and later reformed in 2006 delivering two LP and becoming the most awaited comeback of the scene. In 2011, they blasted our lands with a religious-obsessed death metal record called III Operis Tertium.\n\nIn the beginning, the band wrote their lyrics in English, but in their last record they switched to the Spanish making their concept more Venezuelan and united with their percussive delivering.\n\nFor the last, I want to give you the recommendation of the final band in this “Big 4 of Venezuelan old-school death metal”: Krueger.\n\nThis was the most atrocious, controversial and crushing bands in the scene because their sadomasochist costumes (the vocalist, Carlos Sánchez, go full on leather with pikes), album covers arts depicting venereal diseases and lyrics about sex, torture and crime. They call their genre as Porn Metal and even with this publicity, I must say that Krueger makes a good usage of the controversy to their music.\n\nFormed in 1990 in the capital city, they’re the most prolific band in the scene with 5 full length albums. Rooted in the most evil and disgusting sound of the death metal, they still deliver some good guitar work with the frenzy maniac instrumental and the alternating use of shrieked and guttural vocals.\n\nI can deeply say that their major contribution to the making of a pure Latin death metal genre, song-wise, is this piece called “Birongo”, which is named after a small town in the central region of the country where a lot of Santería rites occur. In that song, Krueger fused death metal with Latin and African rhythms to accompany and the percussive use of the distorted guitar the criminal lyrics about sex, Venezuelan ghosts, death and madness.\n\nIn last year, they edited a new LP that I think is a great example to the other bands in the country: Venezuela: Cuentos Grotescos de Amor y Muerte, it is an entire concept album about the most famous crimes in the news in the 80’s decade.\n\nFor example, this song is about one of those police and journalism cases that spawned books and a movie.

  "latent_30034": "Fethullah Gulen Terrorist Organisation (FETO), blamed for last month’s failed coup to topple President Tayyip Erdogan in Turkey, has “infiltrated” India, according to Turkish foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu.\n\nAsserting that FETO is “secretive transnational criminal network” with presence around the world, Cavusoglu said, “Unfortunately, FETO has also infiltrated India through associations and schools.”\n\nIn an interview to PTI after holding talks with his Indian counterpart Sushma Swaraj, the Turkish foreign minister also said, “I have already taken up this issue with my counterpart.”\n\nThe visiting minister said, “In all countries where FETO has a presence, we ask them to take immediate actions to remove them from their territories.”\n\nAsked for a response to the Minister’s comments, external affairs ministry spokesperson Vikas Swarup said the Indian side is “sensitive” to Turkish concerns and Indian security agencies were “looking into” Ankara’s demand for closure of associations connected with FETO which were carrying out illegal activities.\n\nAsserting that terrorism, in all its forms and manifestations constitute a threat to India and Turkey, Cavusoglu said, “Therefore, exchange of information regarding these threats and bilateral and multilateral cooperation and solidarity against terrorism is crucial.”\n\n“This is what both Turkey and India are focused on,” he said.\n\nTalking about last month’s coup attempt, the visiting dignitary said that a clandestine faction led by FETO within the Turkish Army attempted to stage a coup on July 15 to overthrow the democratically elected government.\n\n“We appreciate the prompt support to our democratically elected government by my Indian counterpart, External Affairs Minister Swaraj,” Cavusoglu added.\n\nMore than 240 people died and over 1,500 others were injured as a fallout of the failed coup.\n\nErdogan had blamed US-based cleric Gulen for the attempted coup last month. Gulen currently lives in self-imposed exile in the US.\n\nThe Turkish minister also expressed concern over the situation in Syria, maintaining that his country was directly impacted by every dynamic of the conflict there.\n\nHe also asked the international community to work together to bring about the much-needed political transition in Syria. “This is not only a prerequisite to end the conflict, it is also essential to effectively fight terrorism,” the minister asserted.\n\nFirst Published: Aug 21, 2016 12:51 IST",

Nowhere is Melville’s stylish brand of minimalism on more electrifying display than in 1967’s Le samouraï, which stars frequent Melville collaborator Alain Delon as a highly disciplined hit man who, after a job gone wrong, must resort to many of the cunning tricks of his trade in order to elude capture. While Melville frequently presented characters with little use for the law, he himself expressed no particular sympathy for the career-criminal way of life. In this clip from a supplement on our newly upgraded edition of Le samouraï, the director elaborates on the precise nature of his narrative attraction to the seedy world of the gangster, describing the film-noir form as a convenient vehicle for exploring such elemental human themes as freedom and betrayal.\n\nRelated Films Le samouraï Jean-Pierre Melville",

That breakthrough relied on using graphene combined with plasmonic nanostructures.\n\nNow researchers at the University of Bath in the U.K. are reporting measurements indicating that graphene could lead to optical switches that are nearly a hundred times faster than materials used in today’s current switches.\n\nThe research, which was published in the journal Physical Review Letters (“Carrier Lifetime in Exfoliated Few-Layer Graphene Determined from Intersubband Optical Transitions”), found that the response rate of an optical switch using graphene to be around 100 femtoseconds, which is about a hundred times faster than the few picoseconds measured in today’s devices.\n\n“We’ve seen an ultrafast optical response rate, using few-layer graphene, which has exciting applications for the development of high speed optoelectronic components based on graphene,” said lead researcher Dr. Enrico Da Como in a press release. “This fast response is in the infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum, where many applications in telecommunications, security, and also medicine are currently developing and affecting our society.”\n\nIn addition to photodetectors and optical switches, graphene is proving attractive for tunable notch filters, an area where IBM has made some interesting progress. Also, researchers have been able to exploit graphene’s wide spectral range for different kinds of tunable lasers that are used in optoelectronic systems.\n\nIn fact, the research team’s long-range goal is to apply this discovery to the development of graphene-based quantum cascade lasers that could be used for pollution monitoring, security, and spectroscopy applications.\n\nImage: Martin McCarthy/iStockphoto",

  "latent_30318": "On October 27, 2017, disruptors in the cryptocurrency field gathered at the San Francisco Ethereal Summit. Sponsored by ConsenSys, the summit provided a diverse mix of panels and workshops that demystified the “initial coin offering” (ICO) or “token generation event.”\n\nSide note: Vernacular is key. Referring to a token launch as an ICO is so \"September.\" The process is now referred to as a “token generation event.”\n\nAt the “How to Launch a Token” panel, token generation event veterans Galia Benartzi (co-founder of Bancor Protocol), Matt Liston (CSO at Gnosis) and Piotr Janiuk (co-founder and CTO of the Golem Project) guided Ethereal participants through a hypothetical: founding a hat company and funding the development through a token. Here are some of the key points that they discussed.\n\nStep 1: Determine if the token model fits for the new company\n\nImagine the whole process backward: What layer does the company involve — application, platform or protocol? Design the decentralized concept first and then discern if a token is necessary.\n\nCriteria:\n\nIs the project based on a decentralized model? If not, equity funding is a viable option –– no need for a token.\n\nWhat is the token’s utility within the network? How are customers involved in the network? For example, is the token facilitating and incentivizing collaboration between the community in the network? If so, tokens (similar to shares and equity in a normal company) are a great way to distribute participation among stakeholders.\n\nTokens work best when fueling network effects around ideas –– when there are benefits to being an early adapter/stakeholder.\n\nStep 2: Find a strong legal team and a favorable regulatory environment\n\nRegulation in the cryptocurrency space is in its infancy and varies greatly around the world.\n\nCriteria:\n\nFind a competent lawyer with an understanding of the space that can give risk parameters. It is important to minimize risk for the project.\n\nSelect a government that defines clear boundaries and has a forward-thinking mentality.\n\nAlthough blockchains and cryptocurrency promise decentralized disruption to all industries, anarchy would be unfavorable to all. All companies must comply with the law.\n\nStep 3: Work on the prototype phase\n\nEstablish a white paper, set up the concept on the testnet and prove the concept.\n\nCriteria:\n\nWhite paper: describe your network, protocol and model. White papers should strike the proper balance between being math-heavy and marketing-heavy. The goal is for users and stakeholders to understand exactly what the network is doing.\n\nProve that your concept works and expose its source code. Everything should be 100 percent transparent to the public.\n\nTrustless (trust forced through code) and transparent networks are critical to long-term success. Secure and validate data by rewarding “oracles,” people who provide trustworthy answers and validate that events did in fact occur. On the flip side, penalize those who lie to the network.\n\nTrust and transparency are paramount for any company that is considering funding its development with a token.\n\nStep 4: Connect with the community\n\nGenerating interest for the token and setting the foundation for strong community support before finally launching a token generation event to the public is crucial.\n\nCriteria:\n\nDevelop a public-relation strategy. Share as much as possible. Post videos, host AMAs, etc. This process can be grueling, but it is necessary to establish a global presence and field questions.\n\nPrepare for a fast-paced environment. Communication builds authenticity and credibility with supporters around the world.\n\nListen to outside perspectives and criticisms.\n\nBecause token generation events allow for decentralized methods of funding, the company’s diligence process should be decentralized to match.\n\nTokens generation events are complicated and don’t work for every business type. However, they unlock a new economic driver: permissionless venture capital.",
  "latent_30606": "Get ready to head back to Camp Firewood, because Wet Hot American Summer is coming to Netflix for an eight-episode long camp reunion.\n\nFollowing in the steps of the revival of cult classic Arrested Development, [Deadline reports] (http://deadline.com/2015/01/wet-hot-american-summer-netflix-limited-series-original-cast-return-1201342994/) that the long hoped-for follow-up to the campy camp comedy has started filming a limited series for Netflix.\n\n\"It's true, camp is back in session. #WetHotAmericanSummer will return for 8 all new episodes,\" [Netflix's official account] (https://twitter.com/netflix/status/553760968933511169) tweeted to its followers yesterday, which the film's director David Wain re-tweeted. Plus, a new Wet Hot American Summer account appeared on Twitter, which is all the proof necessary to prove this is not a dream.\n\nWain once again teamed up with his The State co-star Michael Showalter to write the script for the new series and they will both serve as executive producers.\n\nThe 2001 film was set at a summer camp in 1981 and had an all-star cast of nascent celebrities, many of whom —like Bradley Cooper, Elizabeth Banks, Paul Rudd and Amy Poehler—traded their short shorts, whistles and knee-high socks for A-list status. Other cast members include The State’s Michael Ian Black, former 30 Rock star Judah Friedlander, Janeane Garofalo, Ken Marino, Zak Orth, Frasier star David Hyde Pierce, Joe LoTruglio, Law & Order: SVU stalwart Christopher Meloni, SNL star Molly Shannon, and Showalter. It's rumored that Archer star H. Jon Benjamin will once again provide his trademark voice, although it’s unclear whether he will be reprising his role as a mouthy can of vegetables.\n\nWhile few other details have been announced, it seems likely that the series will be a prequel to the film. Back in May, Variety reported that such was being discussed. Plus both Wain and [Marino] (http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/news/q-a-ken-marino-talks-wet-hot-prequel-the-state-reunion-and-burning-love-20121019), who played luckless in love camp counselor Victor Pulak in the film, have hinted that a prequel was being developed\n\nOf course, if the series flashes back too far, Benjamin’s can of mixed vegetables might still be out growing in a farm and the campers could still be in diapers—and there’s no chance any of these counselors would change them.\n\nIt seems like the film’s cast is as excited as fans. Lo Truglio tweeted: “It's on like Donkey Kong bc Donkey Kong happened in 1981, just like this movie,” while Marino [sent out ] (https://twitter.com/KenMarino/status/553739893147312128) a special dedication to his character’s love interest, “I hope Abby Bernstein’s still waiting for me.”\n\nWhile the original film tanked at the box office, its afterlife as a cult favorite and the newfound celebrity status of much of its cast pretty much ensures the new series will be at the top of a lot of Netflix queues.",

I want to go to work and storm out of there in a big huff, a huge, “You know what I really think?” type of berserker rage, my finger pointing every which way, “That’s what I really think!” I’m causing a huge scene, I’m flailing my arms around, plates of food dropping on the floor, the manager goes to call security, “somebody get the cops, he’s out of control.”\n\nI’ll swing around to the dining room, I’ll take a bite out of some guy’s hamburger, sure, they’ll eventually drag me out of there, whatever man, you’ve got to sedate me? Whatever, bring it on, chain me up and throw me in front of that judge, “Listen son, you’re obviously very disturbed, so the state’s going to go ahead and offer you a choice: hard time in prison, or a treatment facility a couple hours north of the city …”\n\nAnd I’ll cut him off, I’ll burn that bridge to the ground even before I cross it, I’ll be like, “Hey asshole, don’t call me son, OK? You’re not my dad. And what, you think I’m interested in your plea bargain? Get the hell out of here. You’re a joke. This system’s a joke.” And they’ll have to wheel me out of there, I’ll be screaming the whole time, little specks of foam flying out of the corners of my mouth.\n\nAfter the sentencing I’ll be in prison orientation, maybe some public advocate will try to appeal to my more reasonable side. But I don’t have a more reasonable side, so he’ll be wasting his breath telling me all about how, “You might be able to shave a couple of years off of your term if you show a little good behavior.”\n\nGood behavior? This guy won’t have any idea who he’s dealing with. I’ll play nice, for a while anyway, I’ll tell him every time he revisits my case or comes to check up on me, I’ll be like, “I’m being really well-behaved. Just ask any of the guards or the warden. I’m like the model of a well-behaved prisoner.”\n\nAnd he might be skeptical at first, because honestly, it’ll be hard to hide my smile, that sinister grin just waiting for him to offer me the slightest inkling of trust. It’ll take a little bit, but I’ll wait, a couple of weeks, how often do those guys visit the inmates, once a month? More than that?\n\nFinally he’ll feel like he might be getting through to me, I’ll contact his office and tell the secretary that I need to see the advocate. He’ll show up to the meeting room and I’ll ask him, “Hey man, did you get my letter?” And he’ll say, “Letter? I don’t think so. When did you send me a letter?” And I’ll look down and say, “Oh … I guess I forgot to …” and then I’ll slam my foot down on top of his foot, like as hard as I can, and I’ll scream out, “Stamp it!”\n\nA classic prank, but taken to the extreme, because listen buddy, I am where I am because of me, not because of some stupid guy in a suit claiming to be on my side. You know who’s on my side? Me. You know who else? Nobody. And he’ll be screaming in pain, hopefully I’ll have at least knocked a couple of toenails off.\n\nI’ll have the maximum sentence, no time off for good behavior, it’ll be the absolute worst behavior that you can imagine. They’ll tell me to shut up and I’ll keep talking. They’ll scream out, “Lights out!” at the end of the night and every single time, I’ll scream out, “Lights on!” in reply. For meal time at the cafeteria, I’ll always cut the line, I don’t care how big all of the other inmates are, I’ll cut, every single time, I’ll go right to the first person in line and say, “Hey man, you mind if I back cut?” and I’ll just do it, I won’t even wait for a response.\n\nEventually they’ll have to let me out, I mean, it’s not like I’ll have killed someone or anything. And even though at my parole hearing I’ll get a lot of warnings about staying away from my old job, about not trying to make contact with my old boss, that’s exactly what I’m going to do. Day one, buy a nice suit. Day two, go back to the restaurant and ask for my old boss.\n\n“Hey boss,” I’ll still call him boss, even though I won’t have worked for him in years, it’ll be like an added layer of discomfort, just like that crazy grin I won’t really be trying that hard to suppress, “I just wanted to say … I’m really sorry.” And I’ll extend my hand, knowing that he’ll take it, if only to get me out of there.\n\nAnd right as he goes for that handshake, I’ll pull back, really dramatically, I’ll do a really obnoxious laugh, “Ha! Sorry you’re such an idiot!” and maybe I’ll consider going on another rampage, but no, I’ll just laugh and walk out of there. And if my parole officer calls? Fuck that guy, he thinks he’s doing me a favor, telling me he’s on my side? He’s not on my side. I’m on my side. That’s it. If you’re thinking about helping me out, help yourself out, and stay out of my way.",

REUTERS/Darren Staples\n\nLONDON — Jeremy Corbyn's momentum shows no signs of slowing down as another opinion poll says Labour would win the most seats if another general election took place today.\n\nThe poll published by Survation — one of the very few pollsters to point towards a hung parliament in this month's general election — puts Labour three percentage points ahead of Theresa May's Conservatives.\n\nLabour is on 44%, according to Survation, which is an increase of three percentage points compared to the general election result. The Tories, on the other hand, are down three percentage points to 41%.\n\nHere are the results of Survation's voter intention survey in full:\n\nLABOUR 44% (+3)\n\nCONSERVATIVES 41% (-3)\n\nLIBERAL DEMOCRATS 6% (-2)\n\nUKIP 2% (=)\n\nOTHER 8 (+2)\n\nIf the British public voted this way in a general election, Labour would win more seats than any other party but 18 seats short of forming a parliamentary majority, according to Electoral Calculus.\n\nHere's the House of Commons would look in this scenario:\n\nElectoral Calculus\n\n44% is the second highest vote share Labour has had in an opinion poll since February 2013. Its highest vote share came in a shocking Survation poll published just days before the June 8 election, which put Labour on 45%.\n\nIt's yet more encouraging news for Corbyn, who has managed to turn around both the party's and his own ratings in just a matter of weeks. A YouGov survey published last week said Corbyn's personal approval ratings had gone from -42% in April to 0% immediately following the election. May's ratings have gone in the opposite direction. The PM had a net rating of -35% in the same YouGov poll, having been rated +10% in April after she announced the election.\n\nIt's been quite the turnaround for Corbyn, who not only is now the country's most popular party leader but a Labour leader with the support of colleagues that not so long ago were desperate to see him resign. Labour MP John Woodcock, for example, who has been one of Corbyn's most vocal critics, said that he had got Corbyn \"totally wrong\" in an interview with his local newspaper the North West Evening Mail last week.\n\nMay, on the other hand, is fighting for her political life, with her credibility at an all-time low. The prime minister's former cabinet colleague George Osborne described her as a \"dead woman walking\" following the election and her handling of the Grenfell Tower tragedy has only led to more questions being asked about her leadership credentials.",

  "latent_30996": "On Wednesday, TransCanada Corp sued the U.S. government in an attempt to overturn President Obama’s Keystone XL pipeline rejection. In a second claim, TransCanada is seeking $15 billion in damages under the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).\n\nThe Keystone XL pipeline was dealt a blow last year after President Obama vetoed legislation that had been approved by Congress. The Senate later failed to override the veto. The pipeline would transport oil from Canada’s tar sands to pipelines in refineries in Houston and other locations on the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nReuters reports that TransCanada filed the the lawsuit in a federal court in Houston, Texas, calling the rejection of its permit to build the pipeline “unconstitutional.” The company is asking the court to overturn Obama’s permit denial to complete the pipeline and a ruling that would block any future president from stopping the pipeline completion.\n\nThe Houston lawsuit names several officials as defendants, including U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch, U.S. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson and Sally Jewell, Secretary of the Department of Interior.\n\nUnder the NAFTA claim, TransCanada is requesting $15 billion to recover its investment in the pipeline. TransCanada said it “had every reason to expect its application would be granted.” Chapter 11 of the NAFTA trade agreement between Canada, Mexico and the United States gives investors the right to make claims against governments.\n\nTransCanada told Reuters it was “prepared for a lengthy process that could take several years.”\n\nDespite President Obama’s rejection of the project, lawmakers in some states still support the planned pipeline. South Dakota’s Public Utilities Commission recently approved TransCanada’s permit to cross into the state.\n\nOn Monday Commissioner Gary Hanson said, “If the company secures a presidential permit and the pipeline is built, the PUC will monitor the progress to ensure the construction conditions are met.”\n\nTransCanada spokesman Mark Cooper told Courthouse News: “This decision in South Dakota further strengthens our commitment to Keystone XL, the safest and most environmentally sound way to transport needed Canadian and American oil to the people of the United States.”\n\nThe pipeline has been resisted by landowners in Nebraska, as well as indigenous communities. Critics also say the pipeline’s purported increasing of jobs is false.\n\nThere have also been disputes over official documents related to the permitting of the pipeline. For example, in early July, Truth In Media reported that Secretary of State John Kerry was issued a subpoena seeking the release of all “reports, recommendations, letters and comments received by the State Department from the advising agencies pursuant to Executive Order 13337 regarding the permit for the Keystone XL pipeline.”\n\nIn a statement accompanying the subpoena, Committee Chairman Jason Chaffetz stated that the State Department has been “uncooperative” and “shown an unwillingness to recognize the Committee’s legitimate interest in obtaining information.”",

(WJLA) - A 16-year-old boy is in jail, charged with raping a 19-year-old woman along the Montgomery County Circuit Courthouse's exterior wall.\n\nAround 11:40 p.m. Thursday, a courthouse security guard noticed a struggle between a man and woman via closed circuit surveillance cameras. The guard notified sheriff's deputies who exited the building and witnessed Marquiz Turner, 16, of Silver Spring, allegedly forcing sexual intercourse on a 19-year-old woman. Deputies immediately took Turner into custody.\n\nThe woman told police Turner had taken her on a date to the Regal Cinemas movie theater in downtown Rockville. When the film ended, Turner expressed his desire to have sex, but the young woman told him she was not interested. As the couple walked to their car, Turner allegedly ripped off the woman's clothing, pushed her against the courthouse's rough concrete facade and proceeded to rape her.\n\n\"To say that this case is shocking would be an understatement,\" Montgomery County State's Attorney's Office spokesman Ramon Korionoff said.\n\nProsecutors said the bold and heinous public date rape was captured in full by the courthouse's high-definition surveillance cameras.\n\n\"I have no words for that actually, it's just the stupidest thing I could ever hear,\" Gaithersburg resident Pedro Branco said.\n\n\"I can't believe that! I mean how stupid do you have to be? You go on a date with someone, big whoop... It's a movie [that costs] $10. Does that equal sex? No,\" Gaithersburg resident Emily Floria remarked.\n\nWhile being questioned at the Rockville Police Department, Turner reportedly told Major Crimes detectives, \"He was unwilling to accept 'no' for an answer,\" and added, \"he was going to have intercourse regardless of [his date’s] objections.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately that thinking is pervasive,\" said Jean Arthur, a counselor for victims of sexual abuse. \"It's just really sad that a person thinks they can do that to another person.\"\n\nParamedics transported the victim to Shady Grove Medical Center for a forensic rape exam. While en-route, the 19-year-old stopped breathing and lost her pulse. Doctors pronounced her dead at 1 a.m., less than 90 minutes after the alleged rape occurred. Many have theorized as to what caused her death, but official autopsy and toxicology results have not yet been released.\n\n\"That's terrifying,\" Floria added. \"I feel so bad for the girl. She was raped on a public street and now she's dead? Wow, just wow!\"\n\nAccording to court documents, Turner is a sophomore at Winston Churchill High School in Potomac where he has a 3.7 GPA. He lives with his mother in a Silver Spring high-rise apartment building along the 1100 block of University Boulevard. No one answered the door Thursday afternoon, but neighbor Felicia Charles did.\n\n\"I'm very shocked. I think that's disturbing. I would have never thought he would do something like that,\" Charles remarked. \"He never gave off that vibe.\"\n\nTurner is currently charged with second-degree rape, a felony that carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. Prosecutors say additional charges may be filed depending on his deceased date’s autopsy and toxicology reports.\n\n\"The fact that a person at 16-years-old even thinks to do that, I mean it just boggles my mind.

  "latent_31812": "Hamburg, Germany (CNN) In Warsaw, crowds waved American flags. In Germany, cartoonish effigies of the American President were hoisted instead.\n\nFor President Donald Trump, a second foreign trip was again a study in contrasts, the quick-shifting reaction to his controversial tenure encapsulating the divided world he and other leaders at the G20 summit confront.\n\nStopping for 15 hours in Warsaw, Trump found a confidence boost among the cheering crowds and like-minded government leaders. Delivering his first major outdoor address on foreign soil, he achieved a presidential moment, even as his message on America's view toward Europe diverged sharply with past US leaders.\n\nIn Hamburg, where the hum of police helicopters provided background music to violent protests, skeptical leaders and sleep-deprived diplomats, his touchdown was a hard landing. The yawning gap between the reception in each city was plain.\n\nOfficials said the originally peaceful protest became violent, with firecrackers and bottles being thrown at riot police.\n\nOfficials said the originally peaceful protest became violent, with firecrackers and bottles being thrown at riot police.\n\nA banner on a bridge reads \"President Macri, Don't sell our Argentina.\" Officials said at least 76 police officers were hurt.\n\nA banner on a bridge reads \"President Macri, Don't sell our Argentina.\" Officials said at least 76 police officers were hurt.\n\nParticipants in the protest.

Protesters clashed with authorities as world leaders gathered for the two-day economic summit.\n\nNot by accident, the first stop on Trump's two foreign trips have placed the President in a comfort zone, replete with adulation from leaders and new deals to announce between foreign governments and the United States.\n\nJust as he did in Saudi Arabia this spring, Trump basked in the admiration mustered by Poland's right-wing government. Standing outside the security barricades, thousands of average Poles -- farmers, students, teachers and shopkeepers -- filled the streets and greeted Trump with cheers.\n\nMany were bused into the capital from farflung provinces by civic committees, an attempt to deliver an enthusiastic welcome for Trump.\n\nThe tactic worked in the opposite way here in Germany. Filling the streets were protesters from across Europe, a contingent of tens of thousands who came here to disrupt the annual G20 summit by torching cars, smashing windows and clashing with fully equipped riot police.\n\nProtests are a fact of life at almost all gatherings of major world leaders, and major summits like the G20 are often held outside of major cities where protesters can be kept far at bay. Here, the city center was gripped with sometimes-violent marchers, a level of unrest rarely seen in Germany.\n\nShuttling through Hamburg in his armored limousine, Trump caught no glimpses of the angry masses. But the demonstrators were successful in making themselves known; first lady Melania Trump was forced to cancel her participation in a program for leaders' spouses when the Hamburg police declared it unsafe for her to leave her building.\n\nMrs. Trump's spokeswoman said the turn of events was \"unfortunate\" since the first lady was looking forward to participating in the events. But the security situation did allow her to avoid a potentially awkward tour of a climate science center , which the husband of German Chancellor Angela Merkel had selected to show visiting spouses.\n\nMore comfortable in his role as global agitator\n\nTrump has angered fellow leaders by withdrawing the US from the Paris climate accord, a position that further drove a wedge between himself and his counterparts at the G20. The inclusion of the climate center visit was in line with a larger effort here to isolate Trump on that issue and a host of other matters where he has broken with his predecessor, Barack Obama.\n\nMerkel noted Trump participated in the first part of the session she organized about climate and \"even made a contribution.\"\n\nIt was a signal that Trump has become comfortable in his role as a global agitator -- even as fellow leaders openly lament his moves on climate and trade, as Merkel and others did Saturday. While officials said he departed last month's G7 meetings in Sicily bruised by a climate lecture from his counterparts, he appeared less upset at the deep rifts between himself and other leaders this time around.\n\nTrump's advisers intentionally kept Trump's European visit short; upon returning from his grueling first foreign swing, the President insisted future trips be curtailed in length. At the G20, however, Trump sought out leaders for one-on-one talks that amounted to a stacked itinerary.\n\n\"He made it more rigorous on himself,\" his top economic adviser, Gary Cohn, told reporters aboard Air Force One as Trump returned to Washington.\n\nJUST WATCHED Ivanka Trump sits in for dad at G20 meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Ivanka Trump sits in for dad at G20 meeting 01:16\n\nAt the G20, Trump appeared not to struggle with the myriad events where leaders are left to mingle amongst themselves. He clasped hands jovially with French President Emmanuel Macron instead of gripping him at length, as he did in May. He smiled and whispered with Merkel, whose hand he declined to shake in the Oval Office earlier this year. And, in a photo posted by the White House, he is seen laughing with Mexican President Enrique Peña Nieto, the president of the country Trump maligned most on the campaign trail.\n\nThere was no awkward elbowing, like during a NATO meeting in Brussels this spring. Even with Russian President Vladimir Putin, a veteran of calibrated body language, there were few outward signs of discord and, even more striking, there were actually signs of collegiality.\n\nThe first glimpse of the two men came from a clip posted on a German government Facebook page; the leaders appeared together toward the end of the rough video, which was set to an electronica soundtrack. Trump patted Putin's arm with his left hand as they shook. Putin pointed toward Trump with his left index finger extended.\n\nIt was the handshake the world had been awaiting. Later, during official talks that lasted more than 90 minutes longer than expected, aides anxiously glanced at their watches as the minutes ticked past. Melania Trump was escorted into the room in an unsuccessful attempt to bring the meeting to an end.\n\nWhile Trump's body language signaled more comfort on the international stage, in other ways his lack of confidence in Germany was evident. Never was that clearer than in Trump's divergent posture with the press.\n\nTrump never broke from his pointedly combative self on this second foreign trip, but a more comfortable-looking President took questions for the first time on international soil standing next to Polish President Andrzej Duda, a politician ideologically more simpatico with Trump.\n\n\"Do you have that also, by the way, Mr. President,\" Trump said turning to Duda, referring to an adversarial press corps.\n\nJUST WATCHED Questions linger over Trump-Putin G20 meeting Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Questions linger over Trump-Putin G20 meeting 10:44\n\nOut-spun by Russia?\n\nAfter landing in Germany, though, Trump kept the press at arms length as world leaders debated -- and later agreed to -- a statement on key issues. As the G20 ended, one by one, world leaders, including Putin, Merkel and Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, stepped behind podiums scattered around the Hamburg's Messe complex and took questions.\n\nTrump was not one of them.\n\nAt one point, Putin -- whose high-stakes meeting defined Trump's first visit to Germany -- referred a question about Russian interference to the White House.\n\n\"I think it is better to ask him what you have asked, rather than me,\" he demurred.\n\nWhen the reporter told Putin the White House had provided no answer, the Russian leader just laughed.\n\nBut the White House's silence was just as telling -- and consequential. Trump, unlike other world leaders, declined to use his bully pulpit abroad. His aides, too, were silent, declining to provide a single on-camera briefing during the three days in Germany.\n\nAnd it hurt them. Minutes after Trump's meeting with Putin, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov was on camera spinning the meeting, telling reporters that Trump accepted Putin's denial of meddling in the 2016 election.\n\nThough White House aides would later deny that claim, their statements came without names and off-camera. After the Trump-Putin confab, it was the Russians who first controlled the narrative.\n\nDespite the diplomatic row that ensued following Trump's meeting with Putin, top White House aides said afterward that they viewed the trip as a success.\n\n\"President Trump has had a very, very significant few days,\" Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin told reporters. \"I would just generally say we've had a very productive economic meetings. There have been very substantive issues discussed.\"\n\nJUST WATCHED Trump urges China to act on North Korea Replay More Videos ...

After three working days in Washington, the President heads back to Europe on Thursday for a quick trip to France for Bastille Day celebrations with French President Macron.",
  "latent_31826": "They’ve already turned the buses away once, and they’re prepared to do it again.\n\nMurrieta, a booming city in Southern California that has grown from only 2,000 residents in 1980 to over 100,000 residents today, has unwillingly become a microcosm of the nation’s struggle to process the tens of thousands of illegal immigrant minors streaming across the U.S. border.\n\nOn July 1, when U.S. officials sought to bus illegal immigrants into Murrieta for processing to relieve the overcrowded centers in Texas, a reported 200 to 300 Murrieta residents stood in the roadway and effectively blocked the buses from delivering their passengers. The buses were forced to turn around and drive to a Border Patrol station instead.\n\nBut the feds aren’t relenting, promising more buses will come and setting up police tape and barricades to keep the roads clear.\n\nMany of the residents, however, are not surrendering so easily.\n\nAccording to a report from KNBC-TV in Los Angeles, many protesters gave up their Independence Day celebrations, or brought their grills and hot dogs with them, to camp out on the bus route and stop the buses again.\n\n“When the buses come, you are going to see Americans that are willing to throw themselves under the bus, that’s what you are going to see,” demonstrator Greg Allison told the station. “I don’t care if I lose a limb. Even if the buses get past me and I lose a limb, guess what? The rest of the country is going to take notice.”\n\nMurrieta Mayor Alan Long, who encouraged the protests, though perhaps not the human blockades, told over 1,000 residents at a town hall meeting July 2, that like it or not, their town has a spotlight shining on them.\n\n“We didn’t ask for this problem – it was just dumped at our doorstep,” said Long, according to a New York Times report. “This is a nationwide problem, and little Murrieta has taken the lead.”\n\nAt an earlier press conference, Long explained, “Murrieta expects our government to enforce our laws, including the deportation of illegal immigrants caught crossing our borders, not disperse them into our local communities.”\n\nMurrieta is one of several cities whose facilities the federal government has tagged to receive migrants as officials seek to lessen the burden on the Texas border, the Los Angeles Times reports. Migrants will also be sent to a border patrol facility in El Centro, in neighboring Imperial County, as well as a center in New Mexico, which has also caused lawmakers there to protest.\n\nMurrieta, however, became a focal point for the conflict, when protesters in the Riverside County city repelled the federal initiative, forcing the buses to drive to San Diego County instead.\n\nAt the town hall meeting, several residents had the opportunity to voice their diverse opinions on the hot-button issue.\n\n“Why do we have to put them on a bus to Murrieta?” one man asked at the microphone. “Why can’t we just transport them on a bus to Tijuana, [Mexico]?”\n\nJeff Stone, chairman of the Riverside County Board of Supervisors, told the audience he was concerned about communicable diseases that the migrants could be carrying, such as whooping cough, swine flu or tuberculosis, the New York Times reports.\n\n“[President] Obama needs to enforce the border and stop this action of exploiting traumatized women and children for his own political gain,” Stone told the crowd. “We need the message to get to Guatemala not to come here because if you do you will be sent back as fast as you came.”\n\nThe Times reports dozens of pro-immigrant residents wearing Mexican soccer jerseys also showed up at the meeting, some holding signs proclaiming, “We are not illegal, we are humans.”\n\n“It doesn’t matter where a child is from,” Lupillo Rivera told the Los Angeles Times. “He deserves respect and help because he’s a child.\n\n“How can a 5-year-old defend himself?” asked Rivera. “I don’t think we should push a child out of our country.”\n\nPro-immigration protester Elizabeth Thornton told the Los Angeles Times she’s dismayed by the tone of the debate so far.\n\n“I’m not a fan of ICE,” she said. “But this is a necessary step for these people to be released. We’re here to counter the overwhelming racism and xenophobia that we’ve seen here the last few days.”\n\nAt the town hall meeting, however, Long refuted charges of racism. He pointed out his own mother and wife are Hispanic and invited his 86-year-old father-in-law to stand, then praised him for immigrating to the U.S. legally.\n\nTensions between the factions are also growing. Several news sources reported as many six people were arrested on July 4, as clashes between rival protesters, and clashes between police and protesters are heating up.\n\nA fight between two women, for example, escalated and resulted in five arrests. One woman was arrested on suspicion of battery on an officer. The other four were arrested on suspicion of obstructing an officer in his investigation.\n\nEarlier in the day, a person crossed the yellow tape that blocked protesters from the Border Patrol station entrance and was arrested on suspicion of disorderly conduct and disobeying an officer.\n\nSome pro-immigration, counter-protesters, according to a Breitbart report, have even taken to burning U.S. flags and tearing them to tatters, impaling the shredded banners on nearby fences.\n\nOne anti-illegal immigration activist told Breitbart pro-amnesty demonstrators called her a “f***ing whore” in Spanish and shouted, “F*** America!”\n\nOne thing protesters on both sides of the issue agree upon, KNBC reports, is that the facilities in Murrieta are not suited for an influx of immigrant children, and the federal government cannot hope to defuse the crisis at the border by simply shipping immigrants around the country.\n\nCity Councilman Rick Gibbs, who toured the Border Patrol facility where the immigrants are scheduled to be held, has reservations about the space.\n\n“This is a jailhouse,” Gibbs told the Los Angeles Times. “This is not a hotel. It is a spartan facility.”\n\nGibbs also doubted whether the detainees would comply with the government requirement that they report back to an Immigration and Customs Enforcement office within 15 days of their initial release.\n\n“We’re going to dump a bunch of people at a bus station, hope they get somewhere in the United States of America, and somehow in 15 days, they are going to respond and come back?” he said. “Everybody knows that 95 percent of them are never going to return.”\n\nCouncilman Harry Ramos agreed.\n\n“You would get fined if you dumped off a dog in the street here in Murrieta, but that’s what they are doing to people here,” he said, according to a Los Angeles Times report.\n\nFor now, federal officials have promised only that more buses will come, but the time of their expected arrival will not be made public.\n\nAnd for now, the residents of Murrieta are ready for them.",

  "latent_32021": "In geometry, the great disnub dirhombidodecahedron, also called Skilling's figure, is a degenerate uniform star polyhedron.\n\nIt was proven in 1970 that there are only 75 uniform polyhedra other than the infinite families of prisms and antiprisms. John Skilling discovered another degenerate example, the great disnub dirhombidodecahedron, by relaxing the condition that edges must be single. Due to its geometric realization having some double edges where 4 faces meet, it is a degenerate uniform polyhedron but not strictly a uniform polyhedron.\n\nThe number of edges is ambiguous, because the underlying abstract polyhedron has 360 edges, but 120 pairs of these have the same image in the geometric realization, so the geometric realization has 120 single edges and 120 double edges where 4 faces meet, for a total of 240 edges. The Euler characteristic of the abstract polyhedron is −96. If the pairs of coinciding edges in the geometric realization are considered to be single edges, then it has only 240 edges and Euler characteristic 24.\n\nThe vertex figure has 4 square faces passing through the center of the model.\n\nIt may be constructed as the exclusive or (blend) of the great dirhombicosidodecahedron and compound of twenty octahedra.\n\nRelated polyhedra [ edit ]\n\nIt shares the same edge arrangement as the great dirhombicosidodecahedron, but has a different set of triangular faces. The vertices and edges are also shared with the uniform compounds of 20 octahedra or 20 tetrahemihexahedra. 180 of the edges are shared with the great snub dodecicosidodecahedron.\n\nDual polyhedron [ edit ]\n\nThe great disnub dirhombidodecacron\n\nThe dual of the great disnub dirhombidodecahedron is called a great disnub dirhombidodecacron. It is a nonconvex infinite isohedral polyhedron.\n\nLike the visually identical great dirhombicosidodecacron in Magnus Wenninger's Dual Models, it is represented with intersecting infinite prisms passing through the model center, cut off at a certain point that is convenient for the maker. Wenninger suggested these figures are members of a new class of stellation polyhedra, called stellation to infinity. However, he also acknowledged that strictly speaking they are not polyhedra because their construction does not conform to the usual definitions.\n\nFilling [ edit ]\n\nThere are different conventions about how to colour the faces of this polyhedron. Although the common way to fill in a polygon is to colour its whole interior, this can result in some filled regions hanging as membranes over empty space. That problem is avoided by another filling rule, in which orientable polyhedra are filled traditionally but non-orientable polyhedra have their faces filled with the modulo-2 method (only odd-density regions are filled in). In addition, overlapping regions of coplanar faces can cancel each other out.[1]\n\nTraditional filling\n\n\"Neo filling\"\n\nSee also [ edit ]",
  "latent_32343": "More than 50 years ago, noted music critic Ralph J. Gleason took movie cameras into jazz legend Vince Guaraldi’s studio to capture the recording of “Cast Your Fate To The Wind” and the album Jazz Impressions Of Black Orpheus. These original films, forgotten in the Gleason family’s attic for decades, have been restored in high definition and are featured in The Anatomy Of Vince Guaraldi—an award-winning feature documentary coming to home video for the 2016 holiday season.“Seeing Vince on camera adds a fascinating perspective to his music, especially for those who fell in love with his iconic score for the Peanuts shows,” says Toby Gleason, Ralph’s son who co-produced the documentary with filmmaker Andrew Thomas. “These early sessions took place in 1962, but we were able to uncover even more unseen film and unpublished audio recordings from later years to expand Vince’s story through his premature death in the mid-1970s.”This story includes Guaraldi’s struggle with Fantasy Records, his composing of the world’s very first “Jazz Mass”, the massive success of “Cast Your Fate To The Wind”, and, of course, the music for the Charlie Brown specials. Vince is widely acknowledged as the inspiration for Snoopy’s “Joe Cool” character. Ralph J. Gleason went on to become co-founder of Rolling Stone magazine and the Monterey Jazz Festival.“Many fans don’t realize that films ofeven exist,” explains Thomas. “And we were surprised to find performances, interviews, and even shots of Vince wandering through the jazz clubs of North Beach in San Francisco . This rare footage from various sources illustrates a vibrant time in music, and it’s completely fresh.”The Anatomy Of Vince Guaraldi also features exclusive performances and participation from Vince’s friends, including, Dick Gregory, George Winston,, and. Also appearing are members of Guaraldi’s band,, and. Lenny Bruce’s daughter, Kitty Bruce, adds stories from the days Lenny shared the stage with Vince at the Hungry i nightclub, and both Professor Irwin Corey (the World’s Foremost Authority) and writer/director Paul Mazursky describe the club’s unrestrained, unconventional spirit.“Lee Mendelson, the producer of A Charlie Brown Christmas, was so gracious to join us to explain how Vince created the iconic ‘Linus & Lucy’ theme,” says Gleason. “George Winston tells us that this melody set him on a lifetime of composing jazz. And let’s just agree that Vince Guaraldi re-invented the sound of the modern American Christmas.”Already featured at various international film festivals, The Anatomy of Vince Guaraldi has received five “Best Documentary” awards, and was a special presentation at the Library of Congress and the Monterey Jazz Festival. But it has never been available for home video or streaming. “We’re asking for help in this effort,” admits Gleason.“We have ato allow us to cover the additional music licensing requirements and, as a premium, it will be the first opportunity to enjoy a copy of the film. You can even get your name featured permanently on the credits.”A special promotion matches some contributions with a second copy of the DVD gifted to various music schools in the name of the contributor, along with uncut “extras” from the production that expand the material featured in the film.More information on the production, along with clips and a trailer, is available on the film’s website.",

It is reported to increase the likelihood of being functionally independent and not increase the 90 day risk of mortality. In the US the licence, or marketing authorisation, for alteplase is limited to 0-3 hours after onset of stroke,1 but some other countries—including the UK and Australia—have extended the licence to 4.5 hours.2 3 4 Irrespective of licensing, most major stroke guidelines support use of alteplase up to 4.5 hours after stroke onset,5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 although several emergency medicine associations do not recommend it (box).17 18 19 20 21\n\nMajor stroke guidelines and recommendations for alteplase at 3-4.5 hours after stroke onset Guidelines presenting strong recommendation for (“is recommended” or highest recommendation rating) American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (Class I; Level of evidence B)5\n\nCanadian Stroke Network and Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada (Evidence level A)6\n\nChinese Stroke Therapy Expert Panel for Intravenous Recombinant Tissue Plasminogen Activator (Level 1 recommendation, Level A evidence)7\n\nEuropean Stroke Organisation (Class I, Level A)8\n\nHaute Autorité de Santé (Professional agreement)9\n\nJapan Stroke Society (level of evidence Ia; grade of recommendation A)10\n\nNational Institute for Health and Care Excellence (“is recommended”)11\n\nNational Stroke Foundation (Australia) (Grade A)12\n\nSouth African Stroke Society (Class I, Level A)13 Guidelines presenting weak recommendation for (lower recommendation rating) American College of Chest Physicians (Grade 2C)14\n\nAmerican College of Emergency Physicians/American Academy of Neurology (Level B recommendation), currently being reconsidered by American College of Emergency Physicians15\n\nAmerican College of Emergency Physicians (draft guideline in process) (Level B recommendation)16 Guidelines presenting weak recommendation against Canadian Association of Emergency Physicians (draft guideline in process) (Weak recommendation, moderate quality evidence)17 Statements that t-PA is controversial at all timeframes and should not be considered standard of care American Academy of Emergency Medicine18\n\nAustralasian College for Emergency Medicine19\n\nCanadian Association of Emergency Physicians (currently posted policy)20\n\nNew Zealand Faculty of the Australasian College for Emergency Medicine21\n\nWe believe that current guidance is based on uncertain evidence and that urgent reconsideration of the available data is essential to guide policy decisions on use of alteplase to manage acute stroke. In the UK the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory Agency is planning to establish an expert working group to analyse all relevant sources of evidence and reassess the balance of benefits and risks for alteplase.22\n\nWe examined the most comprehensive sources of evidence and advice that working clinicians are likely to turn to for guidance on whether to use alteplase after stroke: a national clinical practice guideline published in 2013,5 the Cochrane review updated in 2014,23 and an individual patient data meta-analysis published in 2014.24 Each of these sources suggests that alteplase is more beneficial than harmful when given 3-4.5 hours after the onset of ischaemic stroke. We tried to verify the data supporting these conclusions. We do not examine evidence or recommendations for the use of alteplase up to three hours after stroke.\n\nClinical practice guideline 2013 We evaluated the American Heart Association/American Stroke Association (AHA/ASA) guideline as the most recent authoritative national guideline.5 The level of evidence is rated B, suggesting some uncertainty because it is based on either limited populations or data derived from a single randomised trial or non-randomised studies.5 Nevertheless, the guideline gives a class I recommendation to use the drug (0.9 mg/kg, maximum dose 90 mg) 3-4.5 hours after onset of stroke. It says a class I recommendation means that “Benefit >>> Risk Procedure/Treatment SHOULD be performed/administered.”5 To support their 3-4.5 hour recommendation, the guideline cites a 2004 individual patient data meta-analysis of six trials (801 patients treated at 3-4.5 hours) that reported increased likelihood of a “global favourable outcome” based on three stroke scales, including the modified Rankin score 0-1 at 3 months (adjusted odds ratio 1.40, 95% confidence interval 1.05 to1.85; unadjusted odds ratio 1.34, 1.04 to 1.72).25 The modified Rankin scale is the most widely used outcome measure in trials of thrombolysis and is a patient oriented measure of function after stroke (table 1⇓).26 The guideline cites the subsequent ECASS III trial27 with 821 patients treated with alteplase or placebo 3-4.5 hours after stroke onset, which found a smaller benefit in the global favourable outcome (odds ratio 1.28, 1.00 to 1.65).5 Table 1 Modified Rankin scale View this table: ECASS III is the only trial to have reported benefit from use of alteplase in the 3-4.5 hour time frame as the primary outcome measure—a modified Rankin score 0-1 (freedom from any functional limitation) at 90 days.27 It contributed the most data at 3-4.5 hours before 2012 and was the basis for some drug regulators and guidelines recommending extending use of alteplase from 3 hours to 4.5 hours after stroke onset. However, baseline differences are likely to have biased the results in favour of the alteplase group, which had a lower proportion of patients with a previous stroke (7.7% v 14.1%, P=0.003). A 2014 report including only the 89% (732/821) of patients without a prior stroke reported no significant difference in the primary outcome between the alteplase and placebo groups (odds ratio 1.19, 0.89 to 1.59; table 2⇓).28 Table 2 Functional outcome data specific to 3-4.5 hour time window in two largest trials View this table: The guideline also discusses another key trial, the Third International Stroke Trial (IST-3), which it describes as “the largest randomized, placebo-controlled trial to date of intravenous rtPA.”29 Although the subgroup of IST-3 patients treated 3-4.5 hours after stroke is the largest dataset for this time frame from any trial,29 the guideline does not discuss results specific to 3-4.5 hours. IST-3 randomised patients who were treated 0-6 hours after stroke onset and used a primary outcome measure equivalent to a modified Rankin score of 0-2 (alive and independent) at six months. Outcomes are reported for 1177 patients who were treated between 3 and 4.5 hours.29 The primary publication included a subgroup analysis of this group adjusted for age and baseline stroke severity. This found no significant benefit with a 99% confidence interval (adjusted odds ratio 0.73, 99% CI 0.5 to 1.07; table 2⇑).29 The statistical analysis plan for IST-3 suggested subgroup analyses would be “interpreted without any consideration of multiple testing” and provided an example of how subgroup results would be reported using 95% confidence intervals.30 The use of a 99% confidence interval in the subsequent publication was not explained. We performed an unadjusted analysis of the IST-3 results for patients treated between 3-4.5 hours using a 95% confidence interval and found a significant reduction in functional outcome (odds ratio 0.76, 95% CI 0.60 to 0.97, number needed to harm=16).\n\n2014 Cochrane review Cochrane reviews usually provide the most valid syntheses of evidence of effects of interventions; under 1% of Cochrane reviews have limitations in conduct and reporting that hinder the summary of best current evidence for clinical decision making.31 But an update of the Cochrane review on thrombolysis for acute ischaemic stroke, published in July 2014, is confusing.23 Key messages and conclusions seem inconsistent within the document and are unclear about the appropriate time window for using alteplase. The conclusion of the abstract says, “Thrombolytic therapy given up to six hours after stroke reduces the proportion of dead or dependent people. Those treated within the first three hours derive substantially more benefit than with later treatment.” However, in the Implications for Practice section, the authors state, “Despite the overall net benefit, the available data do not provide sufficient evidence to determine the duration of the therapeutic time window” and suggest “there is no evidence to withhold alteplase … if it can be administered within 4.5 hours.” The plain language summary states that thrombolysis “definitely improves outcomes if given up to 4.5 hours after stroke.” We examined the Cochrane review analyses for the 3-4.5 hour time window but they were too limited to be useful. They include one trial of alteplase (ECASS III) and one of streptokinase (showing harm). They do not report subgroup data for 3-4.5 hours from the larger number of trials that used a wider time window that included 3-4.5 hours—for example, those that randomised patients between 0 and 6 hours. The review also did not include the individual patient data meta-analysis, and such meta-analyses are not typically performed in Cochrane reviews. The Cochrane review does report outcomes for alteplase use between 3 and 6 hours and finds no benefit for thrombolysis.23 Subgroup analyses of alteplase at 3-6 hours (both by time randomised and by time treated) suggest no significant effect on functional independence (odds ratio 0.97, 95% CI 0.85 to 1.09 and 0.93, 0.83 to 1.04, respectively) but suggest a marginally significant increase in mortality (odds ratio 1.17, 1.00 to 1.38 and 1.16, 1.00 to 1.35, respectively). These results are opposite to those of subgroup analyses of alteplase at 0-3 hours. With such differences in functional independence and mortality by time windows, an overall conclusion on use from 0-6 hours no longer appears valid for informing clinical decision making. At this point, the subgroup analyses covering 3-6 hours may be the best approximate view of the 3-4.5 hour time window, but a focused view on 3-4.5 hours would be ideal.\n\nIndividual patient data meta-analysis 2014 Arguably the most valid and comprehensive approach to determine treatment effects is an individual patient data meta-analysis. This involves the central collection, validation, and re-analysis of the primary data from each trial. In August 2014, the Stroke Thrombolysis Trialists’ Collaborative Group published an updated meta-analysis including individual patient data from all nine completed alteplase trials for which data were available.24 The previous 2010 meta-analysis included eight trials with 1620 patients in the 3-4.5 hour time window.32 More than half of the data for this analysis comes from the ECASS III trial.27 The prespecified primary functional outcome (a modified Rankin score of 0-1 at three months) was reached by 44.6% in the alteplase group and 37.7% in the placebo group (adjusted odds ratio 1.34, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.68). This was consistent with benefit from the drug: number needed to treat for one additional beneficial outcome=15. The 2014 update included data from IST-3, which had 1177 patients in the 3-4.5 hour time window and reported a primary functional outcome of modified Rankin score 0-2 at six months (adjusted odds ratio 0.73, 99% CI 0.5 to 1.07, table 2⇑).29 The reader might have expected that combining the odds ratio of 1.34 from the 2010 analysis with the 0.73 in the subgroup analysis from IST-3 would result in an odds ratio close to 1.00 and confidence intervals extending above and below 1.00 showing no significant benefit from the drug. However, the 2014 meta-analysis concluded “alteplase significantly improves the overall odds of a good stroke outcome when delivered within 4.5 hours of stroke onset.” Of those randomised within 3-4.5 hours, 35.3% receiving alteplase achieved modified Rankin score 0-1 compared with 30.1% of controls (adjusted odds ratio 1.26, 95% CI 1.05 to 1.51).24 The discrepancy in the summary statistics might be explained by differences in the outcome analysed; the meta-analyses used modified Rankin score 0-1 and IST-3 used modified Rankin score 0-2. Could excluding participants with modified Rankin score 2 (slight disability) from the functional outcome explain the result? If this was the case, it would suggest that data from IST-3 show benefit for modified Rankin score 0-1 but harm for modified Rankin score 0-2. Further analysis of the 2014 data to explore whether this is the case, and to quantify the effect for both modified Rankin score 0-1 and 0-2 groups, seems appropriate and relevant to clinical decision making. Alternatively the unexpected, positive result of the 2014 meta-analysis could be related to which participants were included in the analysis.24 Different methods for defining the 3-4.5 hour subgroup, counting time from symptom onset to alteplase administration, or counting time from symptom onset to randomisation may have resulted in the meta-analysis not including the same patients as the subgroups in the original studies. We reviewed the protocol for the IPD meta-analysis since neither explanation seemed sufficient. The protocol says33: It has already been established that thrombolysis with iv alteplase (rt-PA) is both effective and safe when administered to particular types of patient within 4.5 h of stroke onset, and that treatment benefit diminishes with increasing treatment delay. Consequently, any estimate of the overall effect for all patients randomised to rt-PA within six-hours of stroke onset provided by the analyses described in this document should not necessarily be used to guide the future use of treatment (or to revisit efficacy in presently recommended subgroups) because of the possibility that such an estimate might be diluted substantially by the results from IST-3 (which, through use of the “uncertainty principle” in its design, recruited substantial numbers of patients in whom the effect of treatment may be proportionally smaller than that observed in previous trials, or even nonexistent). The prespecified analysis plan does not clearly describe an analysis to determine if alteplase is effective at 3-4.5 hours after stroke. The authors seem concerned about the potential for IST-3 to “dilute substantially” the previous meta-analysis results.33 The authors seem to wish to avoid “revisiting efficacy” for the “established use” within 4.5 hours of stroke onset.33 However, the “uncertainty principle”—the concept that patients in IST-3 were appreciably different from patients in previous trials— does not clearly apply to the enrolment of patients in IST-3 at 3-4.5 hours after stroke. This time frame was not considered an indication for alteplase for most of the time of IST-3 enrolment (2000 through 2011). The functional benefit reported in the 2014 individual patient data meta-analysis for use of alteplase at 3-4.5 hours has too many open questions for us to consider the result a reliable summary of the underlying data. More transparent analysis and reporting are needed to determine the effect on functional outcome estimated by existing trials. Meanwhile alteplase 3-4.5 hours after stroke onset has clearly established harms. The 2014 meta-analysis found that the risk of fatal intracranial haemorrhage at seven days was increased (adjusted odds ratio 5.63, 95% CI 2.49 to 12.76, estimated number needed to harm=44).24 This rounds up to a 2% absolute increase in mortality at seven days, and the authors stated “by 90 days this 2% excess remained but was no longer statistically significant.” Although critics might argue that the harms including mortality are included in a global disability endpoint, patients may not weigh all outcomes similarly; using an “overall disability measure” to discount the effect of mortality therefore seems inappropriate for decision making.\n\nFull data must be made available We have summarised data for the 3-4.5 hour time window from the most comprehensive and relevant sources above (table 3⇓). The evidence on the effects of alteplase at 3-4.5 hours after stroke on functional outcomes is inconsistent. Some data support an increase in good functional outcome at three months, and others show a worse functional outcome at six months; any single estimate of effect from currently available data is therefore likely to be unreliable. However, data from the same trials show a clear increase in the risks of symptomatic intracranial haemorrhage and fatal intracranial haemorrhage and suggest an increase in mortality at 90 days (table 3⇓). Table 3 Data on functional outcome data and harm specific to 3-4.5 hour time window View this table: The key to resolving uncertainty about the benefits and harms of alteplase 3-4.5 hours after stroke lies in publishing more of the underlying data forming the basis of the 2014 meta-analysis and reanalysing them transparently. Individual trial results for patients treated between 3 and 4.5 hours (including modified Rankin scores) are needed to enable evaluation of heterogeneity and determine consistency across these data. This would show whether meta-analysis is warranted (or at least inform the statistical approach applied to a meta-analysis). Realistically, considering the overall volume of data, complexity, and inconsistencies, an independent analysis of the available data may not “settle” the issue and is more likely to result in the conclusion of insufficient evidence and a call for additional research. Unless and until there are data showing unequivocal benefits to outweigh known harms, we believe that there should not be any strong recommendation or encouragement for use of alteplase beyond three hours after stroke. Key messages Use of alteplase 3-4.5 hours after stroke is supported by guidelines and meta-analyses based on analyses that do not directly examine treatment in this time frame\n\nDirect comparisons of alteplase with no alteplase at 3-4.5 hours after stroke suggest an absolute increase in mortality of 2% and no clear benefit\n\nRecommendations to use alteplase 3-4.5 hours after stroke should be re-evaluated\n\nNotes Cite this as: BMJ 2015;350:h1075"
