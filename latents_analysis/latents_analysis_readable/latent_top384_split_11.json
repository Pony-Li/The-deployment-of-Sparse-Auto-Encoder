  "latent_37": "On Dec. 5, the daily Sabah, the flagship of Turkey’s pro-government media, came out with an assertive headline: “It is very clear that Daesh [Islamic State], the PKK and FETO are acting all together.” Accordingly, these three very different nonstate actors — IS (radical jihadis), the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK Kurdish separatists) and the Fethullah Gulen Terror Organization, or FETO (an Islamic cult with political ambitions) — were attacking Turkey at the same time in a well-coordinated campaign. Moreover, their coordinator was the nefarious “mastermind” — a conspiratorial power that President Recep Tayyip Erdogan invented in 2015 and has been defined by his supporters as the US government.\n\nThis Sabah “news story” was not unique; it is rather a political narrative that one can read in Turkey’s pro-government media literally every single day. It is a narrative based on a partial fact: Turkey, indeed, has been targeted by repeated terror attacks by IS and the PKK. It is also common wisdom in Turkey that the Gulenists were indeed the main element behind the failed coup attempt in July. However, the assertion that these groups are coordinated by a single major manipulator is not a fact — it is a conspiracy theory.\n\nErdogan seems to agree with this conspiracy theory, as he not only gives his blessing to the pro-government media but even publicly refers to their “news” — including unabashedly fake news. For example, in a recent public speech, Erdogan said, “An American general declares, ‘We founded [IS].’ It is not me who is saying that; it is him.” This was a clear reference to a recent fake news story on A Haber, the Sabah TV channel. A two-minute video of retired American Gen. Wesley Clark's statements on the discussions in the wake of the Iraq War of 2003 was subtitled by A Haber, but by a crucial add-on: “We needed a hammer, so we founded [IS],” the American general was made to say on A Haber, while the original sentence only read: “If all you have is a hammer, then every problem looks like a nail.”\n\nAren’t there any people in the pro-government media who oppose such fake news — of which there is plenty — and the conspiracy theories based on them? There are just a few. But they are on the margins and are condemned by hard-core pro-Erdoganists — on social media or aggressive websites — as “traitors” who are serving the United States by concealing its plots. Anti-Western conspiracy theories make up today’s official ideology, and those who doubt it attract a lot of wrath.\n\nYet for anyone who doubts the official ideology, the theory that all terror groups are united — regardless of what one thinks about America — is implausible. IS and the PKK are not in collaboration; rather, they are at war with each other. The PKK’s Syrian affiliate, the Democratic Union Party, has been actively fighting IS over the past two years, and IS is hitting back. In fact, the first three major terror attacks by IS inside Turkey — in Diyarbakir, Suruc and Ankara, all in 2015 — were directed at leftist Kurdish targets, which were considered pro-PKK. It is more correct to say that Turkey has been the stage of the IS-PKK conflict — along with their independent attacks on Turkey — rather than the target of a united IS-PKK attack.\n\nAs for Gulenists, their ambition to capture the state led to a bloody coup attempt, and thus created a major security problem for Turkey. But to consider them as the conspiratorial element under every stone, especially after all the great purges following the coup, does not seem realistic. Meanwhile, it is clear that IS considers the Gulenists “infidels,” and allegations of PKK-Gulen ties seem overblown.\n\nWhy, then, do Turkey’s current masters insist that all these three different forces are coordinated? Why do they see themselves in a puppet show where all the hostile characters are controlled by a Western “mastermind”?\n\nThe first answer to this question is Turkish political culture, which is still largely a relic of the 19th century. Accordingly, world politics is merely a zero-sum game of brutish states, where conflict and conspiracy is the rule, while mutual gain and cooperation is an illusion. The major Western powers always want to weaken and subdue the Turks, and that explains why Turkey faces so much trouble. In this scheme, nonstate actors are never given any agency. They are always explained as pawns of other states. This is a worldview embedded into the Turkish education system, and it has been kept alive by governments that preceded the Erdogan era as well. It is just the way the majority of Turks — more than 75% of them, according to a recent poll — intuitively look at the world.\n\nThe second answer is that belief in a global conspiracy against Turkey frees the Turkish government from any responsibility. Had the government examined IS, the PKK and the Gulenists as independent actors, then there would be many questions to ask the government: Why did the government disregard the IS threat for such a long time? Why did the government's “peace process” with the PKK fail — or, if it were such a bad idea, why did it begin in the first place? And why did Erdogan empower the Gulenists in all state institutions for a whole decade until they turned against him? But all such questions evaporate when all answers are found in a collective Western conspiracy against the glorious “New Turkey.”\n\nFinally, there is a third reason that makes the conspiracy theory about terrorism so appealing to Turkey’s new ruling elite: It is a testimony to their grandeur. It is one thing to be targeted by small bands of fanatic zealots. It is another thing to be targeted by the whole world system that orchestrates so much evil. The latter view makes the Turkish ruling elite feel globally important. They are accomplishing a revolution that will transform the whole world for the better, and that is why all the demons of the world are united against them. It is a way of self-aggrandizement.\n\nYet feeling good about yourself is not enough to solve your problems. In fact, the belief in conspiracy theories rids Turkey’s ruling elite of the capability of effectively fighting terror, as Etyen Mahcupyan, a longtime supporter of Erdogan who lately turned critic, has continuously stated in his column. It disallows understanding the root causes, ideologies and strategies of terrorist groups. It also infringes on the cooperation Turkey could normally have with its Western allies against terror, I would say. But that is neither easily said, nor sanely heard, in today’s Turkey.",
  "latent_110": "What’s New in 2.0\n\nPerformance\n\nBased on 3rd party benchmark, lower is better\n\nThe rendering layer has been rewritten using a light-weight Virtual DOM implementation forked from snabbdom. On top of that, Vue’s template compiler is able to apply some smart optimizations during compilation, such as analyzing and hoisting static sub trees to avoid unnecessary diffing on re-render. The new rendering layer provides significant performance improvements compared to v1, and makes Vue 2.0 one of the fastest frameworks out there. In addition, it requires minimal effort in terms of optimization because Vue’s reactivity system is able to precisely determine components that need to be re-rendered in a large and complex component tree.\n\nIt’s also worth mentioning that the 2.0 runtime-only build weighs at only 16kb min+gzipped, and totals at 26kb even with vue-router and vuex included, on par with the v1 core alone!\n\nRender Functions\n\nDespite the rendering layer overhaul, Vue 2.0 maintains a largely 1.0 compatible template syntax with only minor deprecations. The templates are compiled into Virtual DOM render functions under the hood, but the user can also opt to directly author render functions themselves when they need the flexibility of JavaScript. There is also optional JSX support for those who prefer it.\n\nRender functions open up possibilities for powerful component-based patterns — for example, the new transition system is now completely component-based, using render functions internally.\n\nServer-Side Rendering\n\nVue 2.0 supports server-side rendering (SSR) with streaming and component-level caching, making it possible to achieve blazing fast renders. In addition, vue-router and vuex 2.0 are designed to support SSR with universal routing and client-side state hydration. See it all working together in the vue-hackernews-2.0 demo app.\n\nSupporting Libraries\n\nThe official supporting libraries and tools — vue-router, vuex, vue-loader and vueify — have all been updated to support 2.0. vue-cli now scaffolds 2.0-based projects by default.\n\nIn particular, vue-router and vuex have both received many improvements in their 2.0 versions:\n\nvue-router\n\nMultiple named <router-view> support\n\nImproved navigation with the <router-link> component\n\nSimplified navigation hooks API\n\nCustomizable scroll behavior control\n\nMore comprehensive examples\n\nvuex\n\nSimplified in-component usage\n\nBetter code organization with improved modules API\n\nComposable async actions\n\nSee their respective 2.0 docs for more details:\n\nCommunity Projects\n\nThe team at Ele.me, the biggest online food ordering platform in China, has already built a complete desktop UI component library with Vue 2.0. Unfortunately the docs do not have an English version yet, but they are working on it!\n\nMany other community projects have also updated to be 2.0 compatible — check out awesome-vue and search for “2.0” on the page.",

But now, as Inside Scoop reports, the news is a little more grave: Chef-owner Kurt Abney, who's been running something of a one-man show in that bustling kitchen for 22 years, sounds tired.\n\nAs he tells the Scoop, \"I’m in my mid-50s. It’s just me who owns it, and I’ve had it for 22 years. I need to think if I want to die by the grill, or have some freedom.\" Thus, he's listed the restaurant and its assets on Craigslist for $479,000. A buyer would assume the restaurant's lease, on which 16 years remain, for a fairly reasonable $12,360/month. It's a 5,400 square-foot space with 60 seats (plus 20 on a roof deck), and Abney says he does a crazy 350 covers a day, on average.\n\nAbney says he may want to reopen somewhere on a smaller scale, perhaps more the size of Dottie's original Tenderloin location on Jones, from which he had to move back in 2012 to its current Sixth Street location.\n\nBut it seems likely that a savvy new owner might want to retain the Dottie's name and brand, given its consistent popularity and tourist guidebook seal of approval. Abney says he'd be open to that too, for a price.\n\nPreviously: 'Personal Reasons' Close Dottie's True Blue Cafe",

Credit Paul Hosefros/The New York Times\n\nConfrontation was, for Justice Scalia, a mark of pride. Like his home borough, he embraced the blue collar and the idea of a melting pot of hard-working immigrants. His father was an Italian immigrant, but he spoke no Italian or Sicilian. He used words like “bums.” He had a habit of referring to “Joe Sixpack” in the law classes he once taught, before “Joe Sixpack” became some kind of American Everyman. He liked the subway and how it could shape a New Yorker, even if he sometimes resorted to cliché.\n\n“You had the subway; the world was your oyster,” he wrote in a 2013 article for New York magazine about his New York childhood. “There was just enough responsibility that was put on young people that any New Yorker would acquire a certain cockiness.”\n\nJustice Scalia knew enough to not let politics get in the way of a good New York friendship. His closest friend on the Supreme Court was the liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, from Brooklyn. (The two other justices from New York come from the Bronx and Manhattan — and everyone knows that Queens is way more friendly with Brooklyn than the other boroughs.)\n\nLike Queens, Justice Scalia had his classy parts. He studied Latin and Greek in high school and won the lead in the school’s production of “Macbeth.” He could play the piano and sing in a velvet tenor, songs from the 1940s and 1950s, or show tunes from “Guys and Dolls.”",
  "latent_425": "Formerly known as frigidity, female sexual dysfunction (FSD) has always been a controversial diagnosis, and now studies are pointing to relationship dissatisfaction and male performance as risk factors. Just whose problem is this, anyway? New research suggests that broad tactics such as treating a woman’s anxiety and improving communication with her partner may be more useful than focusing on the physical mechanics of sex.\n\nFemale sexual dysfunction is a broad diagnosis that indicates trouble in one or more of four areas: desire, pain, arousal and orgasm. Controversy about FSD has centered on two key points: whether those who are pushing it as a physiological disorder have something to gain from medicalizing it and whether it reflects society’s attempt to pathologize women’s naturally variable sexuality. According to sexologist Andrea Burri, author of a study from the U.K. on FSD that appeared in the September 2011 issue of the Journal of Sexual Medicine, “Describing a sexual dysfunction as a physiologically caused abnormality leaves out factors related to the patient’s sexual partners and socialization factors. Personally, I believe that we are using the term way too arbitrarily.” Although she accepts that some women do have a physiological impairment that can contribute to sexual problems, she thinks that using loose diagnostic criteria lumps far too many women into the category of dysfunction.\n\nBurri’s study, which assessed about 1,500 women in the U.K. for FSD, found that 5.8 percent of them reported recent problems with sex, and another 15.5 percent reported lifelong dysfunction. Hyposexual (low) desire was the most common problem overall, and the most common predictor of FSD was relationship dissatisfaction. This finding supports the criticism that the concept of FSD is misleading because it implies that there is something wrong with the woman who “has” it, when in fact it is often the relationship that has issues. The study also found anxiety, experience of abuse and obsessive-compulsive disorder to be common predictors of lifelong FSD.\n\nA study last June also pointed to relationship dissatis­faction as a risk factor for FSD, as well as male premature ejaculation—so in this case, his dysfunction becomes hers, further obscuring the diagnosis.\n\nOne way researchers are attempting to minimize some of these issues is by including personal distress as a diagnostic criterion for FSD. Pain during sex or a lack of desire, arousal or orgasm does not indicate a disorder unless it is causing distress to the woman herself—and that does not include the distress she might feel because of her partner’s reaction in bed, explains Marita McCabe, a psychology professor at Deakin University in Melbourne, Australia. Burri cautions that the distress criterion nonetheless presents some concerns. “A considerable proportion of women who do not report a sexual problem do report feeling distressed about their level of sexual functioning, so there is the question as to what causes a woman to feel sexual distress,” she says. “Is it really an intrinsic feeling, or is it caused by societal expectations?”\n\nRegardless of its cause, distress about sex is quite treatable. McCabe authored a study last October showing Internet-based therapy to be effective for FSD when it focused on three objectives: helping participants feel more comfortable about their bodies, lowering their anxiety in sexual situations and improving communication with their partners.\n\nThis article was published in print as \"It's Not Me, It's Us.\"",

  "latent_512": "Image by: Moth Collective\n\nFrank is an advocate for perhaps the most universally despised group in America: sex offenders.\n\nProduced by Steven Jackson and Chloe Prasinos.\n\nThis episode is brought to you by:\n\nThe Affair from Showtime. Season 2 starts on October 4th.\n\nTranscript\n\nJust to set the stage for you… Mid-morning, blinds were closed, I grabbed an empty bottle and I headed down to the water store, because I knew I was going to be drinking some coffee, and I like good water. I had a client right after that, at ten o’clock; I was going to go straight to them, and I decided not to, I decided to come back and drop that bottle of water off first. Well, when I started up the street and got within eyesight of my front door, I saw it was open. I’m like, “I didn’t forget to shut that… Hm!” And there was an odd car parked in the driveway. So I start up into the house, up the steps, and I notice pieces of plaster on the ground. I notice that the doorjamb has been wildly jammed aside and broken. I head in towards the dining room, and there stands a tall, young man, well-built, and in his right hand was my framing hammer, and in his left hand was my sledgehammer.\n\nI could see no pupils in his eyes, and immediately I thought, “This guy’s on drugs, probably meth.” That was David. And I said, “What the fuck is going on here? What the fuck is going on here?!” He turned towards me, while raising his right hand, with the hammer, and I knew that this was an attack starting, and he said, “What the fuck are you gonna do about it, you sick motherfucker?” And when he said ‘sick motherfucker’, that didn’t resonate with somebody who’s a robber. Why would they say that?\n\nWhat was going through your head?\n\nGet out of the way. Get that bottle up, because that hammer’s coming down, and BOOM! And then again, as I’m backing up, BOOM! And that’s, I guess, when the head of the hammer got stuck in the bottle, and that knocked it then out of my hand. It exploded, as I hit the railing with my back, and I went up and over, and down onto the ground behind me.\n\nFortunately, my head didn’t hit the curb, but the impact dazed me for a moment, and as I came around to a more conscious level, and started to get up to protect me and find that attacker and where the hell he was, I noticed the hammer was sitting next to me. Now I had a weapon. So I pick it up, looking for the attacker, and I see him coming around the bush as I’m backing up now, and then he starts again, and his comment is, “I’m gonna fuck you up, you pervert.” I believe that was his word, ‘pervert’. It’s like, okay, this has got to do something with my past.\n\nHis feet are now being kicked at me, and I’m blocking them, and holding the hammer, ready to strike. And right about here, I raised and said, “Hey, what the fuck are you doing?” And he looked at me, dazed and confused, like he really didn’t know what he was doing. Then I saw what had softened then become hard again, and that rage. And then the fist and feet again, and I backed up more. And again, I raised the hammer – this time even higher – and said, “Hey!” and he stopped. He pointed to his temple and said “Hit me”, really soft. “Hit me.” And then it got more intense, “Hit me!” and then more intense, “Hit me!!” and then “HIT ME!” – four times, and then he came at me again and this time I was able to get around and start to move out towards the street, instead of heading up into a dead end.\n\nSo you were running…?\n\nI am backing up as fast as I can.\n\nAnd you’re watching him at your back?\n\nI am keeping my eye on him, and as… That second time I was considering laying him out, but I decided not to because at that moment, when I said, “Hey, what are you doing?” I saw a confused little kid, and it’s like, “Wait a minute… There’s something there.” I shouldn’t kill it, so I didn’t, and that’s when I saw a next-door neighbor, and I hailed his name, and at that point David had picked the sledgehammer back up and he was coming my way. I’m like, “Okay, this is dueling hammers. Here we go.” David turned and saw the neighbor and decided, “Okay, I’m getting out of here,” and he threw the sledgehammer at me, and unfortunately I was not able to dodge it completely, and it hit my left knee, directly head-on, but he got around to the side of his car, got in it and sped away. I was grateful to see him go.\n\nLet me ask a question… Can we take a break?\n\nYes. You should ask it any moment.\n\nOkay… Because this is kind of intense, so I kind of like to have a little tobacco. Would you like a warm-up on your coffee?\n\nI’m good on the coffee…\n\nLet’s take a break… [voice fades out]\n\n* * *\n\nHi…\n\nHi, my name’s Frank, and I’m a registered citizen in the state of California, also known as a sex-offender. And I just wanna let you know that that’s not who I am, that’s something I did 35 years ago. It’s not who I am today, and so I don’t particularly care for that title. I will accept the title of a registered citizen right now, because that’s what I am – I’m a citizen and I’m required by law to register, because I had sexually offended in the past, and I am not able to get myself off of that registry in the state of California, because it is a lifetime registry. So I work with a group of individuals in order to change the laws so that people like me that have demonstrated they can be whole, healthy citizens can relieve themselves of this nightmare that is involved with being a registered citizen and/or sex offender.\n\nThe stocks were for humiliating somebody that had done something errant. They were done away with quite a while ago, but the registry is nothing but stocks, that hold somebody in shame. The punishment does not fit the crime. Lifetime registry in the cases of some of these registrants is just not warranted; it’s egregious. You have an 18-year-old that has a 17-year-old girlfriend, and the parents on the girl’s side get tweaked and they report it, he’s on the registry for life. You have a 16-year-old girl that takes a nude selfie and sends it to the boys, and the boy’s mother gets a hold of the phone and looks at it, and she now has been accused of creating and distributing child pornography, and she’s on the registry for life. You’re caught peeing on the side of the road or behind the sports bar? Registry for life. The point we’re trying to make with our organization is that one size does not fit all in these cases, and that they need to be looked at individually, and those that are severely errant and incapable of correcting their lifestyles, yes, they need to be watched; the public needs to know about them. But to shame and blame them all, and make them all look like these horrible incidents that you hear about, that’s not right either. Two wrongs don’t make a right. You know, it’s been okay to wrong the sex-offender; it’s been okay. Take their money, it’s okay. Abuse them, it’s okay. It’s not okay. You can’t just try to throw away a segment of society by legislating them out of existence.\n\nThe whole idea is prevention here. How do we keep children safe? How do we prevent abuse from happening? And typically it’s been ‘contain the red dots.’ Make their lives miserable, wind it down to where they’re not moving anywhere, they’re staying in their homes and staying away from people because they’re all broken, they’re gonna all do it again. Well, that hasn’t worked; the abuse rates have not come down. There are those that are so severely addicted to this action of having illegal sex with someone; for some reason, they’re attracted to that. They feel drawn to do that, that is their way of releasing, as in the definition of pedophile is someone who just can’t have sexual gratification unless it is with a child. Does it ever go away? For me, it did. For me, it did. That’s not a concern of mine. What is it like being a person like that? I don’t know. I would imagine that’s a nightmare, a huge nightmare. God… You know, I can’t imagine; I just can’t imagine that, because I know for me what it was like wanting to have relations more than I was having relations. I had a big drive, and it wasn’t always satisfied; I always wanted more. Age appropriate, but wanting more. That was a nightmare at a certain stage in my life, kind of around this stage when this happened.\n\nSo like in your 20s?\n\n20s, big time. Raging testosterone, raging desire to do that. Becoming bored with one partner, wanting to move to another partner. It was just nothing but ego, tied to testosterone bump.\n\nIt sounds like you’re saying you were grateful to have your hand slapped, in a way…\n\nI was, because then that started me re-examining everything that I was doing, including this insatiable need to go out and try to score women that would want to get together and do the happy dance; but it wasn’t fulfilling. It’s like, okay, this is not leading in the right direction. There is something beautiful about a young lady, especially when they’re walking around in string bikinis. Would I look? Do I desire to bed them down? No. Are there those that might? Yes, they might, and that’s a struggle. We need to give them an outlet for that.\n\nLike what?\n\nFollow-up programs that are confidential, that aren’t going to land them back in jail for ten years for something they thought. That’s a tough sell to the general public because they’re under the impression that they should just be locked up and the key thrown away.\n\nSimilar to like a suicide prevention hotline.\n\nExactly. And intervention, at least by phone, could be provided, to hopefully stop the thoughts from becoming action.\n\nAnd the person on the hotline is articulating to someone who’s having those thoughts the harm that that abuse could inflict?\n\nSure, sure. Not only to the victim, but dude, if you get caught, let me tell you what your life is gonna turn into. Try to get a job. You have a job right now? Try to keep that job. Oh, and you have a nice car? Oh, well, without a nice job, you’re probably not gonna be able to keep that car. A house? A girlfriend? You might as well kiss it goodbye. Oh, by the way, you can’t live in this city, or that city, or this city, or that city because they’ve got ordinances that ban you. If I had someone to talk about those errant thoughts that I was having, it would have never happened because I would have had someone that would be able to give me some idea of the harm it would cause to that person, and I had no framework of that. My framework came from what I had experienced as a kid, and the game of sex. It wasn’t abusive to me, I didn’t feel harmed. It was more like play.\n\nYou’re referring to when you were a kid?\n\nWhen I was a kid.\n\nSo at 26 when the offense happened, did you still kind of have that…?\n\nWell, I have to tell you that that experience happened in a very drunken state. How it got started, I’m not quite sure, but it got started. I wasn’t thinking enough the harm it would cause, because at the moment it wasn’t causing harm according to her.\n\nSo it was consensual?\n\nI don’t want to say that, because she’s not sitting here and cannot say one way or the other, whether or not she was resistant or receptive.\n\nBut you perceived that she…\n\nI perceived that it was receptive, and I can tell you that when she said, “Okay, I don’t wanna do this anymore,” it was over. It was not, “Oh, let’s keep going,” no. There were no threats, no violence, and I woke up the next morning going, “Oh, man… I shouldn’t have done that.”\n\nBack in the ’70s, you could not pick up a men’s magazine without reading at least one story of the adolescent and the adult. It was pervasive. It was almost okay, strangely enough. It was being written about all the time. I guess that’s what made it okay for me to not listen to that voice that was saying, “This is wrong, don’t do this.” But I went ahead and did it anyway.\n\nThe day of my offense, it was a day that I had off. Because it was a day off, and because I was no longer enjoined to my first wife, who had left about six months prior, it was kind of a lonely space, so I filled a lot of that time with drinking. I headed over to the corner liquor store probably about ten in the morning to pick up some alcohol. Leaving that store, I heard someone call my name from an apartment that was across the street from that liquor store, and went over to chat. Inside there was two to three other guys, and they had a weights bench activity going on. Each one was taking turns pressing weights. My upper body strength is pretty good, so eventually I asked to try, and the weights they had on there were pretty light.\n\nAs the day progressed, the weights got heavier, and in-between, for libation, I would take a little of this Wild Turkey that I had purchased; a nice, bolstering shot. At some point I started having a little beer with that Wild Turkey as well, and the weights kept going up, and up, and up, and the day wore on and on, and at some point this young lady showed up. There was somehow… Some teasing got started, and that progressed.\n\nWhat kind of teasing?\n\nYou know, those are kind of sketchy detail, and I just don’t want to go into the details of what happened, because that leads constantly down this road of talking about this incident, and that is just something I don’t want to do, because she’s not here. But it… Yeah, that’s how it got started, then I asked her, “Do you wanna continue doing this?” and she said, “Yes,” so I said, “Well, my house is little ways away.” She got permission from her parents and we walked over to my house. We spent maybe 15 minutes, maybe 20 in this touchy-feely interaction. At a point she said, “I’m done with this, I don’t wanna do this anymore,” and I said, “Okay.” I walked her back home, and that was it.\n\nI went back home, and immediately started feeling a burden. As this was unfolding, inside me was that voice saying, “This is not right.” By the time I passed out that evening, that little voice was saying, “That was really wrong.” It’s a churning in the stomach, it’s an unrest in the chest that just says, “This was wrong. I should not have participated in this.” But I did. I felt it in my heart that I crossed the line. I should never have let that happen, but there was desire and alcohol that just, if anything, made it more exciting at the moment. I was addicted to that moment.\n\nThe day after the incident happened I was kind of walking aimlessly, and there was a church, and I wandered in. I sat alone, I don’t know for how long, to say I’m sorry. I just remembered that.\n\nTwo weeks later the parents showed up at my door. I was actually napping on the couch, still trying to stay numb because I just felt horrible about what had happened, it wouldn’t leave my brain alone. Knock on the door, I opened the door and it was her parents.\n\nDid you know her and her parents?\n\nNo, I didn’t. That’s the crazy thing. I had never met them, but I had seen them that evening. He made an accusation, and I said “Yes.”\n\nWhat did he say?\n\nHe said, “My daughter told me that…” and I don’t remember the exact words he used, but “you had contact with her.” I’m not sure how he…\n\nHe must’ve been angry.\n\nWell, he didn’t look it, and the wife was standing right behind him. But as soon as I said, “Yeah, that happened”, it was like a huge burden. Finally got to admit it. Well, I didn’t know that he had nunchucks in this back pocket, and they came out, and the flailing started. It was everything I could do to fend those blows off as best as possible, but when you’ve got two of those things going on in rapid fire, some of them you miss. But what I was feeling was that rage that I knew I would probably feel if it was my daughter. So I looked at him as being justified for his rage. Didn’t particularly care that it was causing pain, but that’s okay, he needed to get his rage out. It felt good that I had been honest. Immediately his wife ran over to my phone and jumped on the phone; I remember her saying, “You’d better get here quick or he’s going to kill him.” [Laughs]\n\nCops came, they gave them their version. Cops came over and said, “Did you do this?” and I said, “Yeah.” “Well, what did you do?” So I told them. Then we get to the police station, I’m under arrest, and a couple hours later they come back and say, “Well, we forgot to Mirandize you. Would you be willing to make that statement again?” So again, I could say yes. My attorney, that I contacted several hours later found out about it and he goes, “Oh… We could have gotten you off.” That’s not what I wanted to do. Here I was, holding on to this huge, ugly, dark secret. I’ve done something wrong, I feel like I’m broken. I feel like I’m not human because I’ve done this, and now I have to carry it. And, you know, who can you go and tell? No one. No one.\n\nWhat’s the code, what’s on the books?\n\nLewd or lascivious acts with a minor under 14.\n\nHow old was she?\n\nI don’t want to go into this, I just really don’t want to go into the details. Not until she’s sitting next to me some day and she can say, “Yes, that’s exactly what happened.” Because otherwise, as I begin to that, you know, first it starts with age, and then all of a sudden you’re hearing things that you would not believe. “Kids don’t do that…” So I don’t tell the story.\n\nFrank, I gotta ask you something. I keep hearing what sounds like justification, and maybe it’s because it’s been 35 years, you’re tired of saying you’re sorry about it. I don’t know what it’s like, but there is this… You distance yourself from it, and it almost sounds like… I don’t know, I mean…\n\nThe reason I distance myself, I guess, is because it’s not who I am now. It’s what I did then. It’s not who I am now. It’s something I did do, yes; that’s a matter of record. It’s also a matter of record that it’s something I have not done for 36 years. Does that make me currently a sex-offender? In my mind, no. Now, is there is a propensity maybe for me to fall off the wagon, get super drunk and go out and do something like that again? I think that’s highly unlikely, but in this universe anything is possible.\n\nYou throw yourself in the same bag with juvenile offenders, or streakers, but that just wasn’t the nature of your crime and you are past the redemption line. You know, I’m not punishing, but it is different. I think that there are a lot of victims that will say, “When he says you won’t believe it’s because that implies that it was consensual.” Or, “1970s, the cultural zeitgeist was that it was okay”, and all these things, they can’t hear it. And sometimes I can’t hear it, and I get angry with you, Frank, because I feel like you’re lining up all the excuses that are to blame, where it was you that did it.\n\nI should have said no. I should have said no, but I couldn’t muster that up. I just couldn’t muster it up. The excitement level was too high, so I participated. In my prurient, salacious interest. That was not right, and I take full responsibility for that. If in the things that I’ve said it has appeared to be trying to diminish the harm that might have been caused – and I do not know how much harm has been caused… I am hoping that she has had a full recovery, that is my hope. And I’m sorry for being evasive in regards to what the event was, but when I tell it from my recollection, it’s from my recollection, and as you pointed out earlier, I cannot speak for her. I really can’t. Maybe someday she will stand beside me, and she will tell the story, and then we’ll let you decide whether it denotes lifetime punishment.\n\nAs far as forgiving myself, the only way I can fully do that is to know that she is okay, and I guess maybe to hear from her that she forgives me; that would help complete it. Or that she doesn’t forgive me. I mean, it could be that way, too. I just don’t know.\n\n* * *\n\nOkay, well, Lifespring was an offering… These were programs for increasing your self-esteem, your self-awareness and your responsibility on the planet. They were considered to be cults, a religious right, they were all over these things about being demon-possessed and what not, but the very first thing, people were told: “This is a safe environment.”\n\nI remember this… We were about three days into the program, about midway through the day, the trainers called out for us to select the partners, and we were going to do a dyad, one-on-one together. So we’re in this dyad, and this subject was given to us that we had to reveal to our dyad partner the worst thing we had ever done. “Oh god, what am I gonna say?” But being said it was a safe environment, I felt okay with letting her know. I simply said that I had molested a child. She held on to my hand, as if to say it’s okay, it’s okay. We were directed back into our chairs to be attentive to the front of the room and quiet, and I was speaking with her a little bit more and trying to lighten it up a little bit, and I was called out for being a disturbance. “Frank, what is so important that you can’t be quiet? Please come up here.” So I went up and he had me sit on his lap, and he said, “Okay, what is so important that you can’t be quiet? What is the worst thing that you’ve ever done?” Then I just… I looked at the young lady that I had told, she looked at me… I would now be a liar if I said anything less than what I had told her, so I told… Oh god, I told the crowd – the microphone was shoved in my face – “I molested a child.” And I do recall hearing a little bit of a reaction, and the fella says, “So how old was she?” And I said, “Well, she was pretty young.” He goes, “How much hair did she have on it?” and I said, “About as much as on your upper lip.” That’s as far as I remember, because things… I went to pieces, I went to pieces at a point. Everybody in the room came up and held me. I was not stoned to death, and that felt good because it was about, I would say, six months after I had gotten out of jail and returned to my home.\n\nThen the next door neighbor I had opened up to, because Lifespring’s all about honesty, so I had opened up to the next door neighbor as they asked why I’d spent some time in jail. Well, that didn’t set well with him, and several nights later I was sitting out on the stoop and he came out with a 2×4 and attacked me. That pretty much told me at that point in time, “This is something you don’t tell people. They have bad reactions. Hm!” So I chose not to tell people.\n\nI got done with my probation and began to build a life. I eventually met a nice woman, we married, we had a child together, I was raising a family, building a business, I came to this community, I wanted to be here, I loved being here, my community loved me, and I wanted to improve my life, and that of the life of my wife and my daughter, so that we can live in a space of love.\n\nThen, in 1995, that all started to unravel, because I was placed back into the abyss. Megan’s Law was crafted by the U.S. Government, and the U.S. Government put it out to the states as a requirement that they have a list of all sex-offenders within their states.\n\nOn the internet, right?\n\nOn the internet, posted for public viewing. My life changed… First thing it was a couple of folks asking very vehemently about me being a sex-offender, and then the landlord that I’d been paying rent to for my very successful business cancelled his relationship and I then lost 90% of my business, and had to retreat into my home, and try to operate what was left from my home.\n\nIt was $100,000 a year, and went down to about $25,000 a year. Last year I brought home $9,000. It just keeps going down.\n\nIt used to be stressful to worry about where the money was coming from, or how am I going to make this month’s house payment. I’ve got lots of clients, and it’s whittled down over the years.\n\nDo you think the ones that fell away, fell away because they learned about your past?\n\nI do know, because I’ve had a couple of them call me up and say, “Oh, your services are no longer needed, because we saw you on TV.” “Oh, okay…”\n\nWhen it came around to telling my daughter, my daughter said, “Oh dad, I’ve known.”\n\nReally? How did your daughter know?\n\nSomeone in high-school… I mean, the news media here was relentless. Nightly, the news was saying, “Go to the Megan’s Law website, find out who the sex offenders are in your area. You gotta know.” Okay… And some people did, and they got back to my daughter… I told her that we needed to talk, and we actually sat right here. She sat in the chair there, and I sat on the couch here, and I told her that I had been convicted of a sexual offense, and I was on the registry. And if she had any questions, I was ready and able to answer every one she had. She basically said, “I don’t have any questions, dad.”\n\nI mean, I look at my life, and what should I show? Should I be the loud guy that’s having folks over all the time to show that I’m normal? And then the neighborhood goes, “Oh, that guy parties all the time.” Or should I be quiet and keep a low key, and then “Oh, he’s the quiet guy.” I can’t fucking win. So I just ask folks not to hate.\n\nThis happened to a friend of mine in Alaska. He went into the grocery store, he’s picking up vegetables, and sure enough, some lady had seen him on the internet, and announces to the whole store that “There’s a sex-offender over by the vegetables!” It’s a fucking nightmare! And this can happen here, so I don’t go out much. And I’ve had that before, where I’ve walked in and people are like, “Don’t I know you from somewhere? Hm…” And what’s interesting is that people that I’ve had for friends for years, that never knew about this, when they found out about it, several of them were very upset with me because I hadn’t told them. They felt like that was some sort of dishonoring of our friendship. What, was I supposed to wear the Star of David on my forehead so everybody knows when I walk in the room? So I don’t make someone feel uncomfortable by not telling them?\n\nStar of David’s maybe not the best…\n\nThat’s what they made the Jews wear…\n\nI know, I follow your logic, but I still disagree with it.\n\nI’m sorry. You know, some sort of mark indicating that…\n\nThe scarlet letter.\n\nYes, scarlet letter. That’s always there. One guy walked down the street, covered with tattoos, and chains, and leather, and I’m looking at this fella out the window and I’m going, “Well, that’s interesting… Never seen him around before.” Well, then he starts coming across the street, he stops right in front of my mailbox, whips his smartphone out and photographs the front of my house. What the fuck is that all about, really? Do I call the police? Hm… Cars that pull up and stop, and look, and point. Oh, interesting… I wonder what they’re talking about. How safe am I in the front yard?\n\nDuring the attack, in the driveway, when I yelled, “Hey, what the fuck are you doing?” I saw him stop, and the mask of anger and rage had fallen off, and I saw this little kid standing there, confused. Who is this person that attacked me? Who is he? I knew what he was going to be facing as far as this track through the courts. I didn’t want to see a little kid beat, and in the day I had to go in and testify. At a point, the judge was looking one way, the DA was looking another way, and I had an opportunity to give him the prayer sign over the heart, with a quick smile, and he smiled back, and we were on the same page. He knew I was not there to fry him. He appreciated that. I believe that we can help restore folks quicker by loving them, than by hating them. And if I’m gonna advocate it, my gosh, I’d better be willing to do it.\n\nI probably visited him at the county, probably seven or eight times before the judgment, and he was shipped off to Wasco. Then I visited him in Wasco, twice. That felt really weird, because I walked across the open prison grounds, with gun towers, and 20 ft high barbed wire fences with razor wire at the top… You know, I’m like, “Are they gonna let me out?” [Laughs] And as I pointed out to David, as I spoke to him in prison, “One day, when you get out, David, the one thing you won’t have to do is register.” Hm… Murderers don’t have to register; drunk drivers don’t have to register… If anybody is more of a threat and has the highest re-offense rate, it’s drunk drivers. They kill more people annually than sex-offenders have probably ever killed. Cumulatively. So who’s really the danger here?\n\nI think public registry is totally invalid, it should never be done. We got rid of the stocks back in the 1700s, and that’s all the registry is, it’s a set of stocks to hold you up for ridicule. This is kind of how it started off in Nazi Germany with the Jews. First they were told they had to wear the tag, then they were told where they could live, then they were told where they could work… Hm. Then they were told they had to go to the shower. Hm. Interesting. This is what we stand against. We like creating bogeymen, and going after them. Right now, the bogeymen are sex-offenders. They’re hiding in dark places, ready to pounce at a moment’s notice.\n\nLast year a registrant and his wife lost their son in a car accident; they were distraught. He and the wife have for the past dozen years taken a cruise every year. So he, again, books a cruise. Two weeks out he gets a letter from Princess Cruise. Princess Cruise says, “Oh, we’ve discovered that you’re a registered sex-offender, and you will not be allowed on board the ship. By the way, we’re not refunding your money.” They thought they could get away with that. They are in violation of 24.6L in the Penal Code. Some angel, at some point in time, put this into the Penal Code regarding sex offenders, that you cannot discriminate against them in housing, jobs, travel. Well, they had broken the rules, and we had it in black and white. They’re a prime target, and that’s why I’ve got a license plate framed that says, “My other car is a cruise ship.” I wanna own a cruise liner and I’m gonna take every registrant on it, for a world cruise. Fuck you people! You think you can just fuck us? I don’t think so. We’re mad as hell, and we’re not going to take it anymore. When you bully someone, you know what you get. Columbine. Hm…\n\nWhen someone gets to the point where they don’t care if they live or die, you’ve got a major fucking problem. And that’s to the point registrants are at. I have talked to registrants that are ready to go ballistic. We’re Americans, we don’t put up with this crap. I take a pledge of allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, with liberty and justice for all. I don’t take those words lightly. No, there isn’t a group that you single out and say, “No, you don’t get liberty and justice.” I’m sorry, that’s part of the Constitution. Registrants are forced to live under a fucking bridge in San Diego, by parole agents. “You live anywhere else other than under that bridge and I’ll violate you and send you back to prison, the last place a sex offender wants to go.” We have another one in Los Angeles. He has to spend a night on a fucking city bus! By order of his parole agent! I’m sorry, it gets my angry just talking about it. Can you imagine living that? Ooh, you’re setting yourself up for a big one! Don’t say I didn’t warn you to not be bullies.\n\nIt sounds a little like a threat.\n\nIt’s just reality. I don’t want it to sound like a threat, I want it to resonate. You fuck with people, you get 9/11. People don’t like bullies. You know, these people are beaten down. I’ve been there, where I laid on this couch for days on end, I never went outside. Those windows were closed, I never looked outside. It was a depressing place, and I have to say, there were times I was thinking, “I could check out. I could check out really easy. Suicide by cop… Why not? I go take out a few, they catch up with me, and just have them do it.” But then I snapped out of it. My daughter, she likes having me around, so I need to stick around. But there are others out there that don’t have daughters. They don’t have anything.\n\n* * *\n\nCan you tell us a little bit about what… You said we wouldn’t believe the whole story… Will you tell us that story? We can turn off our microphone.\n\nHm… This is interesting, because fear comes up now. Fear comes up, because then I’m gonna have to sit here and consciously remember, so that I can tell the story. Fear comes up of what you’re gonna think of me. Will I become more of a demon, or will I become more human? What do you think?\n\nIt’s something that I’ve been thinking about a lot, because I think when we first met I saw you in much simpler terms: you were a good guy who had done a bad thing. And as I’ve gotten to know you better, it’s become more complicated, and I guess I want to hear your truest version of what happened. I think the only reason to ask you to go through it again, and talk about it, is because it’s more true. That’s all that I can arrive at.\n\nI feel kind of differently, I don’t know if I want to know.\n\nReally?\n\nYes, I don’t know if I need to know the details of that night. I mean, we requested the court records and we read.\n\nDid you get the sealed records?\n\nNo.\n\nBecause there wasn’t much in court records.\n\nNo, there wasn’t.\n\nWell, what I’m doing is I’m leaning right now to, okay…\n\nWhy?\n\nBecause I trust you guys that you’re investing so much time in trying to get a full and complete picture, that I owe it to you. That if you want to know, then I should be able to tell you, so you can say to yourself whether or not I’m the story you want to tell. And if I hold back and don’t tell you the story, you may not feel that I’m fully honest, and capable of being that way, and that’s calling to question everything I’ve said. It makes me very nervous. Do you mind if I have a little tobacco?\n\nI do see it potentially being a problem. If somebody hears this and they’re upset with me, I do not want them to come and visit me again, and this might prompt that visit. I think I owe it to you guys.\n\nI do wanna say… I don’t feel like you owe us anything. I don’t want it to seem like we’re pressuring you.\n\nThis is a relationship we’ve developed. We’re in a relationship. That’s hugely important. So for you to know that what I have spoken is the truth, then I need to tell the whole truth. So… But we’ll have to turn the recorders off.\n\nOf course. Here we go…",
  "latent_610": "Not content with signing almost every free agent in the fighting game community back in January, Echo Fox have added Tekken players Choi \"Saint\" Jinwoo and Kim \"JDCR\" Hyun-Jun to their roster.\n\nSaint, arguably the better known of the two right now, took first at both EVO and The King of the Iron First Tournament last year. He also claimed the top spot at Final Round 19 and placed third at EVO 2015.\n\n\"We still can't believe we are part of this team,” Saint said in a statement sent to theScore esports. \"When we first got the email and we saw the word 'Echo Fox,' we couldn't take our eyes off those two words. That’s when we realized our lives would change from this moment on.\"\n\nDespite not having played much competitive Tekken in 2016, JDCR is a legend in the scene, with strong tournament placements going back to the World Cyber Games 2011, where he took third in the Tekken 6 tournament.\n\nHe's been a dominant presence in the Tekken Tag Tournament 2 scene, taking first at the MLG Fall Championship in 2010 and first at EVO 2014, before placing fourth in EVO 2015's Tekken 7 tournament.\n\n“Becoming pro-gamers has been always our dream,\" JDCR said in a statement sent to theScore esports. We are really proud of being on a team where we can view fellow pro-gamers as co-workers and family. We look forward to maturing as players and individuals with the Echo Fox organization. We really appreciate Echo Fox for this opportunity to grow together.”\n\nFor Echo Fox owner Rick Fox, the move was an inevitable one.\n\n“When we expanded our fighting game team last month we did it knowing that it was only the first step towards becoming a dominating force in the fighting game community,\" Fox said in a statement sent to theScore esports.\n\n\"By signing the two of the best Tekken players in the world, Saint and JDCR, we’re moving closer to that goal. I’m pleased to welcome them both to the team.”\n\nIn January, Echo Fox signed Street Fighter players Justin Wong, Taniguchi \"Tokido\" Hajime, Momochi \"Momochi\" Yusuke and Momochi \"ChochoBlanka\" Yuko, Mortal Kombat players Dominique \"Sonic Fox\" McLean and Brad \"Scar\" Vaughn and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U player Leo \"MKLeo\" Lopez Perez.\n\nIncluding Saint and JDCR, Echo Fox has 11 fighting game players in five different scenes signed to their team the largest FGC roster of any major esports organization.\n\n“JDCR has always been a player I've had my eye on as he’s proven himself to be a champion time and again. Saint, on the other hand, is a player you simply can't ignore -- the man has been on a rampage in Tekken 7,\" Echo Fox fighting game general manager Antonio Javier said in a statement sent to theScore esports.\n\n\"What makes their signing even better for us is that Saint, JDCR, and the existing roster of Echo Fox Fighting Game athletes, are all fans of one another. If I was looking for an intangible reason to sign Saint and JDCR, this is it -- the mutual fandom and respect for and from their teammates.”\n\nWhile Namco Bandai has yet to announce an official esports presence for Tekken 7 beyond last year's King of the Iron Fist circuit, Tekken 7 will be featured at EVO 2017, CEO 2017 and Combo Breaker 2017.\n\nDaniel Rosen is a news editor for theScore esports.

  "latent_633": "The following script is from \"Liam Neeson\" which aired on Feb. 23, 2014. Anderson Cooper is the correspondent. Ruth Streeter, producer.\n\nLiam Neeson at 61 years old has become one of the highest paid movie stars in Hollywood. You may remember him as Oskar Schindler in Steven Spielberg's movie “Schindler’s List” or in dozens of other classical dramatic roles, but today he's best known as one of the most sought after action stars in the movie business.\n\nNeeson's success is bittersweet. Five years ago his wife, the actress Natasha Richardson, fell while skiing and died from a traumatic brain injury. He's said very little about her death, until tonight. We decided to start this story about Neeson where he was born. In Ballymena, a simple town, just outside Belfast, Northern Ireland.\n\nLiving with grief: A conversation between men\n\nLiam Neeson: There’s my house down there. Our house, I should say.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Which one? That one right there?\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah, it's funny, they look so quaint now, these houses.\n\nAnderson Cooper: So when you were growing up here, was it working class?\n\nLiam Neeson: Very working class. Yeah. Hard working people. Protestant and Catholic. Doesn’t suffer fools gladly. Could see right through you.\n\nAnderson Cooper: And you’re still the same way.\n\nLiam Neeson: I hope so.\n\nNot many Ballymena boys dreamed of becoming an actor, but Liam Neeson was drawn to the stage in grammar school.\n\nLiam Neeson: This is the stage where I first performed. I think I was 11 or 12 years of age.\n\nLiam Neeson: And I joined it because there was a gorgeous-- there's always a gorgeous girl.\n\nAnderson Cooper: That's what was at the root of it?\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah, yeah. Who had skin of alabaster. Kid you not.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Really?\n\nLiam Neeson: Lips, cherry red. She was 11 years of age.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Do you remember that feeling of being on the stage for the first time?\n\nLiam Neeson: I sure do. I'll never forget it. And I know where I was standing. Right over there. And it was, like, \"Oh my God, this is great.\"\n\nNeeson saw acting as an escape. He went to Belfast where he auditioned for the director of the Lyric Theatre. At the time, Belfast was a dangerous place because of clashes between Protestants and Catholics over British rule.\n\nLiam Neeson: I called up. And they were actually looking for someone over six feet.\n\nAnderson Cooper: So that was one of the first questions they asked you, \"How tall are you?\"\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah. And I said, \"I'm 6'4\".\" And she says, \"Be up here next Thursday.” So I came up and did an audition. And very-- a very crude but passionate, desperate audition for her. And she says, “Why do you wanna do it?\" I said something like-- \"If I don't do it, I'll curl up and die.\"\n\nAnderson Cooper: Did you mean it?\n\nLiam Neeson: I did kind of. It was a way out.\n\nHe won his first movie role at 28, cast as a knight of the Round Table with Helen Mirren in the 1981 film “Excalibur.”\n\nLiam Neeson: I fell in love with Helen Mirren. Oh my God. Can you imagine riding horses in shiny suits of armor, having sword fights and stuff, and you're falling in love with Helen Mirren? It doesn't get any better than that--\n\nMirren helped get him an agent, and his talent, good looks, and sexual magnetism won him Hollywood’s attention. Over the years he got small roles in big films, but he didn’t get worldwide recognition until he was cast in “Schindler’s List” by director Steven Spielberg.\n\n[Neeson in “Schindler’s List:” Their fingers polish the insides of shell metal casing. How else am I to polish the inside of a 45 millimeter shell casing? You tell me. You tell me.]\n\nAnderson Cooper: He said that he-- he wasn't looking for a movie star. But he was looking for somebody who women would—\n\nLiam Neeson: Yes?\n\nAnderson Cooper: That had a presence but that women would fall for.\n\nLiam Neeson: He didn't tell me that. But I think he certainly wanted someone without any cinematic baggage.\n\nLiam Meeson was nominated for an Academy Award for his role, but we were surprised to learn he isn’t satisfied with his performance.\n\n[Neeson in Schindler’s List: This car, what good would have bought this car….]\n\nLiam Neeson: I thought the film was quite extraordinary except for myself.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Really?\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Are you always that critical of yourself?\n\nLiam Neeson: I was of that one.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What did you not like about yourself though?\n\nLiam Neeson: I didn't own the part. I just-- it wasn't-- I-- I didn't see enough of me in there.\n\nNeeson says he does see himself in the action movies he’s been making the past few years though at times he seems almost embarrassed by his success as an action star.\n\nLiam Neeson: I'm 61 years of age, man, you know? Going around, fighting these guys, I feel a wee bit embarrassed, you know? And, of course, there's always a part of mind you think, \"Oh, I wish I was 37 years of age again,\" you know?\n\n[Neeson in “Taken:” I will find you, and I will kill you.]\n\nHe was 56 when “Taken,” the first action thriller he starred in came out it cost just $25 million to make and earned more than $250 million at the box office. He was as surprised as anyone that it became a hit.\n\nLiam Neeson: I was convinced it was straight to video so it would go under the radar.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Why did you think it would go straight to video?\n\nLiam Neeson: It just seemed such a simple little story, I thought. There was nothing complex about it. It is a guy going-- determined to find his daughter. Oh yeah. OK. Oh, look. He finds her. And he kills all these guys.\n\nIn his newest action film, “Non-Stop,” Neeson plays an air marshal fighting terrorists aboard a plane. It’s a physically demanding role, one few actors his age can pull off.\n\nNeeson works hard to stay in shape. Well aware there are only so many years left to make the big money of an action star.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Reports are for “Taken 3,” you're gonna make upwards of $50 million. You're laughing.\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah.\n\nAnderson Cooper: So you're a working class guy from, you know, from Northern Ireland. Does that feel real to you?\n\nLiam Neeson: No, it's kind of-- it's-- that's fantasy time, you know? It is. But it’s great, you know. And it's not gonna last. You know, so I'm milking it a little bit, you know? Not in an ego way. But I'm just like-- I'm saying, \"OK, I'm comfortable with this.\"\n\nThe first “Taken” film came out just two months before Neeson’s wife Natasha Richardson died.\n\nLiam Neeson: We got married here in this house. Yeah. Twenty years ago.\n\nLiam Neeson and Natasha Richardson\n\nAt their farm house in upstate New York he agreed to talk with us about Natasha’s death. They’d worked together, on Broadway in Eugene O’Neill’s classic play “Anna Christie” in 1993.\n\nLiam Neeson: She was a radiant beauty. Yeah, cascading hair. I remember. There was-- that was very, very attractive.\n\nLiam Neeson: I'd never had that kind of an explosive chemistry situation with an actor, or actress.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You actually felt it on stage?\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah, she and I were like Astaire and Rogers. We had just this wonderful kind of dance, free dance on stage every night, you know?\n\n[Scene from “Anna Christie”\n\nNatasha Richardson: And I must say I don’t care for your langue. Men I know don’t pull that rough stuff when I’m around.\n\nLiam Neeson: Ladies…]\n\nNatasha was the daughter of British actress Vanessa Redgrave, she continued her acting career while raising their two boys, Micheal and Daniel who were just 13 and 12 when she died.\n\nLiam Neeson: And she cared for everybody. She has-- she has a motherly instinct. And she'd make dinners for everyone and just looked looked after us all. You know?\n\nAnderson Cooper: I heard you can find the cloud in even in a silver lining.\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah.\n\nAnderson Cooper: And she was sort of-- she would see the silver lining.\n\nLiam Neeson: Yeah. I would always see the glass half empty.\n\nAnderson Cooper: You do?\n\nLiam Neeson: She would see it half full.\n\nIn March 2009, Natasha was on a ski vacation in Quebec, Canada, with her oldest son, Micheal. She was coming down a beginners slope on Mont Tremblant, when she fell and hit her head. She wasn’t wearing a helmet. An ambulance was called but she reportedly turned down medical attention and was escorted to her hotel room by her ski instructor and a member of the ski patrol. Neeson was in Toronto filming a movie when she called him.\n\nLiam Neeson: I spoke to her and she said, \"Oh, darling. I've taken a tumble in the snow.\" That's how she described it.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Do you think she had any idea about what could go wrong?\n\nLiam Neeson: No. Of course not. Who would, you know.\n\nWhat Natasha didn’t know was she was experiencing what doctors call the lucid interval, a period when someone with a traumatic brain injury appears normal but blood is building in the brain causing pressure which can be fatal. A second ambulance was called and Natasha was taken to the local hospital arriving more than three hours after the fall. Neeson received a call from his assistant.\n\nLiam Neeson: And Joanna said, \"Look, you better get up there straightaway.\" And then I flew up immediately.\n\nLiam Neeson: When I was in the air the pilot was told, \"Listen, divert your flight to Montreal because she's gonna be taken to the-- the big hospital in Montreal.\" I got a taxi to this hospital and uh-- this doctor, he looked all of 17, showed me her X-ray. And you didn't need to be a rocket scientist to see what was happening. You know? It's-- it was like a cartoon. You know, the brain's squashed up against the side of the skull. And it's-- as the blood tries to get a release. You know?\n\nAnderson Cooper: Was she conscious then?\n\nLiam Neeson: I was told she was brain dead. And seeing this X-ray it was, like, \"Wow.\" You know. But obviously she was on life support and stuff. And I went in to her and told her I loved her. Said, \"Sweetie, you're not coming back from this. You've banged your head. It's-- I don't know if you can hear me, but that's-- this is what's gone down. And we're bringing ya back to New York. All your family and friends will come.\" And that was more or less it. You know?\n\nAnderson Cooper: But at that point you didn't think that there was any hope?\n\nLiam Neeson: She and I had made a pact. If any of us got into a vegetative state that we'd pull the plug. You know? So when I saw her and saw all these tubes and stuff, that was my immediate thought. Was, \"OK, these tubes have to go. She's gone.\" But donated three of her organs, so she's keeping three people alive at the moment. Yeah. Her heart, her kidneys and her liver.\n\nAnderson Cooper: That must give you a good feeling.\n\nLiam Neeson: It's terrific. Yeah. It's terrific. And I think she would be very thrilled and pleased by that too, actually.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Did it seem real to you?\n\nLiam Neeson: It was never real. It still kind of isn't. There's-- there's periods now in our New York residence when I hear the door opening, especially the first coupla years, she would always drop the keys in the-- on the table. Say, \"Hello?\" So anytime I hear that door opening I still think I'm gonna hear her, you know. And, then, it's-- grief's like-- it hits you. It's like a wave. You just get this profound feeling of instability. You feel like a three-legged table. Just suddenly you just-- the Earth isn't stable anymore. And then it passes and becomes more infrequent, but I still get it sometimes.\n\nAnderson Cooper: What’s it like to suddenly be a single parent raising two teenagers?\n\nLiam Neeson: Listen, I'm OK. You know. It could have been a hell of a lot worse. I'm name dropping for a second. Bono is a pal and he came 'round to have a dinner. And I remember he was sitting beside Micheal and, just out of the blue he said, \"What age are you, Micheal?\" He said-- Micheal said, \"Thirteen.\" And he said, \"Yeah, that's the age I was when I lost my mum.\" That was it. And it-- I-- I coulda kissed him for it. He was, like, saying, \"You know, I lost my mom at this age and I'm doing OK. And you will do OK too.\" You know.\n\nHe went back to work just days after Natasha’s funeral and he’s worked nearly nonstop ever since.\n\nLiam Neeson: I'm not good with-- without work. I just don't-- I wallow too much. You know? And I just didn't want to-- especially for my boys, to be-- seem to be wallowing in sadness or depression or--\n\nAnderson Cooper: Having a schedule. Having some place to go. Having--\n\nLiam Neeson: Having a schedule. Yeah. Yeah.\n\nAnderson Cooper: That helps?\n\nLiam Neeson: That helps a great deal.\n\nHe’s made more than 20 movies since Natasha’s death…\n\nAnderson Cooper: What do you think she would make of-- of your--\n\nLiam Neeson: What, “Taken 5”?\n\nAnderson Cooper: Well, no--\n\nLiam Neeson: --that I’m about to do?\n\nAnderson Cooper: No, your action mo-- your-- your status now. I mean the money you're making. The clout you probably have in Hollywood.\n\nLiam Neeson: She'd be very-- she'd be very-- chuffed at that. She would-- yeah, she would.\n\nAnderson Cooper: Chuffed is a good thing?\n\nLiam Neeson: Chuffed's a good thing. Yeah. She'd be-- she'd be-- she'd be--\n\nAnderson Cooper: She'd be tickled by it?\n\nLiam Neeson: She'd be tickled. Thank you. Yeah.",
  "latent_752": "Mashable Choice highlights the best of everything we cover, have experienced first-hand and would recommend to others.\n\nIt's October, which means it's time for sweater weather, pumpkin spice everything and new iMacs.\n\nApple on Tuesday updated its 27-inch iMac with Retina 5K display with better specs. It also introduced a new model, a 21.5-inch iMac with Retina 4K display.\n\nLast year, I reviewed the first 5K iMac and found it to be a great machine with a truly amazing display. This year, I'm reviewing the newest model, which features Intel's Skylake processor, faster AMD graphics and better RAM.\n\nThe look of Mac\n\nThe outer design of the 27-inch iMac is the same as last year. It has the same insanely high-resolution (5,120 x 2,880) display and the same port configuration that includes four USB 3.0 ports, two Thunderbolt 2 ports and gigabit Ethernet.\n\nApple 27-inch iMac (2015) review\n\nOn the inside, however, things start to get different. In addition to updated internals, the display on the new 2015 iMac is now better than ever.\n\nInstead of the standard sRGB color gamut, the new iMac features DCI-P3 color gamut that has a color space of 25% more available colors to display.\n\nIn practice, what this means is that reds and greens really, really pop. Looking at images in sRGB mode versus those in wide gamut, it was astounding to see the kind of details the new display allows to show up.\n\nThe end result is the display — which was already one of my favorites ever — is even better. I watched Inside Out on the new iMac and it was a glorious, glorious experience.\n\nThe display is the heart and soul of the 27-inch iMac, and it's the reason you'll want to buy this machine. A year later, I'm still wowed by 5K.\n\nThe good news for new iMac buyers is that in 2015, all 27-inch iMac computers come with the 5K display.\n\nThe numbers game\n\nThe model we tested came with a 3.2GHz Intel Core i5 processor with 8GB of RAM, an AMD Radeon R9 M390 graphics card with 2GB of RAM and a 1TB Fusion Drive for storage. This configuration sells for $1,999 and is a step up from the base model 27-inch iMac.\n\nImage: Jhila Farzaneh/Mashable\n\nRunning Geekbench, the CPU results were actually slightly behind the iMac I reviewed last year. That makes some sense because that machine, which had Intel's Haswell architecture, was clocked at 3.5GHz.\n\nBut in graphics tests, I found I got better performance from the GPU on the new iMac than last year's model. This was true on synthetic tests and on some games I played.\n\nThe graphic improvements aren't earth-shattering, but the improvements are real.\n\nThe RAM in the 2015 iMac is faster than before, though that didn't seem to impact my tests.\n\nApple did change how the Fusion Drive works in 2015. To allow for a lower-cost Fusion Drive option, Apple paired a 1TB hard drive with a 24GB SSD. In the past, the 1TB Fusion Drive matched a 1TB standard hard drive with a 128GB SSD. Now, if you want the 128GB SSD, you'll need to have a 2TB or 3TB Fusion Drive offering.\n\nThe upside of the new Fusion Drive configuration is that it makes the feature — and its faster response times — affordable for anyone. The downside is you don't see speed improvements of documents and apps offloaded to the SSD as much because the cache is smaller.\n\nFor the average user, your hard disk performance is still going to be really strong — especially once OS X starts to sort of learn your habits. Still, if you're ponying up the money for a new iMac, I would recommend going ahead and paying for either a larger Fusion Drive configuration or just going with a straight SSD upgrade.\n\nThe iMac is a very powerful machine. I have friends who have moved from the Mac Pro to the 5K iMac, simply because it's a great machine with a fantastic screen.\n\nThat remains true in 2015. I look forward to seeing benchmarks from the other Skylake-equipped models because I think the performance of that chipset will really show at higher clock speeds.\n\nNew Magical friends\n\nApple took the arrival of the new iMac to update its accessory line. The Apple wireless keyboard, Magic Mouse and Magic Trackpad all received major updates.\n\nImage: Jhila Farzaneh/Mashable\n\nAll three devices now have built-in rechargeable lithium-ion batteries. If you've ever owned a wireless Apple accessory, you've probably invested in some rechargeable AA batteries and have experienced the annoyance of having to track down an extra battery just so you could finish your work.\n\nThe new accessories charge via a built-in Lightning connector. A fully charged mouse, keyboard or trackpad will last about a month during normal use. Even better, the accessories come with Lightning cables so you can easily plug into the back of the iMac if you need a quick charge.\n\nThe keyboard — now known as the Magic Keyboard — features the new \"San Francisco\" font, larger key caps (and full-size function keys) and a new scissor method that is supposed to make it 33 percent more stable. The keys themselves resemble those on the new MacBook — but the travel is more akin to the exiting wireless keyboard and the keyboard on the MacBook Pro and MacBook Air.\n\nBecause it gets rid of the big battery hump, the Magic Keyboard is now thinner than before and its incline isn't as steep. Apple has also eliminated a lot of spacing on the top and bottom of the keyboard, which means it takes up 13% less space overall.\n\nThe Magic Mouse 2 looks the same as the old Magic Mouse — at least until you turn it over. The bottom no longer has a battery door, it just has a Lightning port — as well as new feet that are designed to move better around your desktop surface.\n\nThe Magic Trackpad 2 gets a complete overhaul. Not only is its surface area substantially larger (29 percent bigger), it now features Force Touch. This means that just like the Apple Watch and MacBook/MacBook Pro trackpads (and similar to 3D Touch on the new iPhone 6S and 6S Plus), the harder you press on the trackpad will determine what happens on the screen.\n\nThe trackpad still has moving parts but it has four force sensors underneath that pick up how hard you're pressing. Force Touch has the potential to be a user-experience paradigm on the desktop the same way 3D Touch is becoming one on mobile. But until now, users who didn't have the latest MacBook or MacBook Pro couldn't use it. Adding the feature to the Magic Trackpad 2 is a big step in helping Force Touch adoption.\n\nOne nice additional feature about the new \"Magic\" accessories is that you can speed up the Bluetooth pairing process by simply taking a Lightning cable, connecting it to an accessory and then plugging it into your Mac. As long as you're running OS X El Capitan, the machine will automatically pair to your accessory, no entering of codes needed.\n\nThe 21.5-inch 4K iMac\n\nAlthough I didn't review the 21.5-inch 4K iMac, I got to preview it with some hands-on time. It has a 4,096 x 2,304 4K display with the same wide gamut display.\n\nThe new 21.5-inch iMac with 4K display doesn't run on Skylake — it's running the latest iteration of Haswell — but it does have faster RAM. You can hook the 21.5-inch 4K iMac up to second 4,096 x 2,304 display.\n\nIts price starts at $1,499, which includes a 1TB 5400-rpm hard drive.\n\nApple will still sell the 1,920 x 1,080 21.5-inch iMac, at $1,099 and $1,299 configurations.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAll in all, the new iMac is a solid upgrade that starts at an even lower price. As always, the real story here is the screen — and now it's even more beautiful than before.\n\nImage: Jhila Farzaneh/Mashable\n\nWith Apple making the entire 27-inch iMac lineup 5K, while also introducing the new 21.5-inch 4K iMac, it's clear the company wants to make every Mac a Retina Mac.\n\nIt's notable that Apple is coming in aggressively on price. Although we would recommend not buying the $1,799 model (spend the extra $200 for a better GPU and the Fusion Drive), simply because non-SSDs make us cry — it's still amazing that such a great display in such a powerful machine is at this price point.\n\nA year after the 5K iMac's debut, we haven't seen any all-in-one offerings that come close to performance or quality.\n\nIf you're in the market for a solid all-in-one with the best screen on the planet, the new 5K iMac is for you.",
  "latent_967": "Proving once again the old adage that you know a technology is hot when the writs start flying, the Wall Street Journal has reported that ZeniMax Media, the owners of Oculus CTO John Carmack's former home id Software, has sent Oculus VR and Facebook, which agreed in March to buy Oculus for $400 million in cash and $1.6 billion in Facebook shares, legal letters. These letters assert that the Rift virtual reality headset was built in part using intellectual property Carmack developed while still at id, and which is therefore owned by ZeniMax.\n\n(Update: Oculus VR has responded at length: their response is discussed here. )\n\nThis is a bump in the road on what has been something of a Cinderella story for the virtual reality startup, which has gone from a Kickstarter campaign that achieved nearly ten times its requested $250,000 in August 2012 to a long run as the poster child for the new wave of virtual reality headsets, culminating in its ten-figure acquisition by Facebook less than two years later.\n\nWhether prescient or simply ahead of the curve, the Rift headset - initially a commodity tablet LCD screen held in a pair of goggles to create affordable stereoscopic 3D virtual reality - has seen high-profile developers flock to it, and giants like Sony launch their own VR offerings in its wake. This week CCP, creators of the Eve Online massively multiplayer online game, will show off the latest developments to Valkyrie, the first game designed for Oculus Rift integration from the ground up, at the studio's Icelandic fan event.\n\nProgress on the hardware has also moved on. The latest iteration of the Rift prototype, codenamed \"Crystal Cove\" was shown at CES, and added the ability to track head motions in space, as well as changes of orientation. It was reviewed in glowing terms by Forbes' Jason Evangelho:\n\nThe Oculus Rift is so damn-near perfect that I honestly think “virtual reality withdrawals” will be a common diagnosis in the near future. But their technology could also bring drastic improvements to education, therapy, things like digitizing artifacts and archives. Historical time-traveling, even.\n\nThe purchase by Facebook shortly thereafter promised the one thing Oculus VR had lacked previously - the financial grunt to produce with scale, and to negotiate on an equal platform with major hardware and software companies. Suddenly, the plucky upstarts were in the vanguard of Facebook's transition from social network to technology company.\n\nObviously, something had to give.\n\nCourt in the Net\n\nZeniMax's claim was outlined in a lengthy email to Engadget (Forbes.com has reached out to ZeniMax to ask if they had any further comment on the issue), the relevant section of which reads:\n\nThe proprietary technology and know-how Mr. Carmack developed when he was a ZeniMax employee, and used by Oculus, are owned by ZeniMax. Well before the Facebook transaction was announced, Mr. Luckey acknowledged in writing ZeniMax's legal ownership of this intellectual property. It was further agreed that Mr. Luckey would not disclose this technology to third persons without approval. Oculus has used and exploited ZeniMax's technology and intellectual property without authorization, compensation or credit to ZeniMax. ZeniMax and Oculus previously attempted to reach an agreement whereby ZeniMax would be compensated for its intellectual property through equity ownership in Oculus but were unable to reach a satisfactory resolution. ZeniMax believes it is necessary to address these matters now and will take the necessary action to protect its interests.\n\nSo, in effect, the claim is that when Carmack left id Software to join Oculus VR, he took with him technology and information developed while he was at iD, with the undertaking that this technology would not be disclosed or exploited outside agreed bounds.\n\nClearly, any equity deal would be rendered impossible by the conclusion of the acquisition of Oculus VR by Facebook.\n\nCarmack and Palmer Luckey, Oculus VR's founder, were both investigating the possibilities of virtual reality before the Oculus Rift had an official existence. Luckey previously worked on a VR project at the University of Southern California called Shayd, for which he developed a head-mounted display called the PR4.\n\nShayd, Oculus VR founder Palmer Luckey's first dive into virtual reality.\n\nAt around the same time, John Carmack, the guiding intelligence behind many of the innovations, from Wolfenstein to Doom 3, that defined how 3D environments work in games, was experimenting with virtual reality, using various headsets, in pursuit of the next technological breakthrough at id, a subsidiary of ZeniMax Media.\n\nBefore launching the Kickstarter campaign for the Rift, Luckey sent Carmack a prototype, after a discussion on a 3D environment modelling board. Carmack took this prototype and built a tech demo using the Doom 3 BFG Edition, an upcoming \"director's cut\" of the graphically pioneering 2004 game. This was shown off to great effect at the ZeniMax stand at E3 in 2012.\n\nThe Kickstarter video for the Oculus Rift, featuring Valve's Gabe Newell and John Carmack\n\nCarmack and Oculus remained in contact, and in August 2013 Carmack officially joined Oculus VR as CTO. Initially acting as a technical consultant to id, he resigned and committed entirely to Oculus VR three months later, after completing work on the id Tech 5 game engine, which will be used in the upcoming Wolfenstein: The New Order and Doom 4.\n\nI spoke to Luckey and Oculus CEO Brendan Iribe last year, shortly after Carmack left id Software. At that point, there were 40,000 Oculus Rift developer kits in circulation, and momentum was building towards the next iteration - what would be known as Crystal Cove. Asked about the value of John Carmack, Iribe highlighted his unique, prodigious ability to bring hardware considerations into software design:\n\nHe is kind definitely a unique engineer, in the sense that he wasn't just the lead architect and programmer of Doom, which was the first \"two and a half D\" experience. You could say Castle Wolfenstein was the very beginning, and then Doom added the mouse, and then Quake is where he really introduced full, perspective-corrected 3D, where you could go above or below things and look up and down. It really is what 3D still is today, and he developed the software, and then went to the GPU [Graphics Processing Unit] producers and started working with hardware companies to put those algorithms into hardware, to make 3D GPUs. So he has this really good understanding of the hardware. With Oculus and VR, it's rare to have someone who understands the full latency loop from the motion to the photon hitting your eye, who can actually go back to the hardware company - the MEMS [Micro-electro-mechanical systems] company, or the CPU company, or the GPU company, or the sensor company, and say \"actually, I need the hardware done this way, so I can make my software deliver the best experience\". He did that for 3D, and now he's doing it with us for VR. Leave it to Carmack to be there at the very beginning and make sure hardware meets software! That's a very unique thing - not just looking at the hardware and trying to make the software work with it, but saying \"no, this isn't good enough, we need to do it better. Let's get in touch with the hardware companies and push on them to make even better technology optimised for VR.\" We're now doing that, and that's a very exciting place. And some of that technology we're building inside Oculus. We're building the hardware ourselves to make sure it's done right. Nobody's really done it before, and it takes guys like Carmack - these creative software engineers - to look at the full loop.\n\nAt the time, Carmack's departure from id was described as amicable, and the narrative - of one of the architects of the modern first-person shooter moving from the womb of Doom on to a new, disruptive project - was an attractive one. This was, of course, also when Oculus VR was a small company, funded initially by Kickstarter and then by a $16 million round of venture funding lead by Spark Capital and a more recent $75 million Series B round led by Marc Andreesen of Andreesen Horowitz, rather than a subsidiary of Facebook.\n\nThis impending transition has been a painful one for some supporters - Minecraft developer Markus \"Notch\" Persson shut down negotiations about an Oculus-driven version of his hugely popular game, describing Facebook as \"creepy\" - and it fundamentally changes the way Oculus is perceived and operates in the market.\n\nForbes' own Erik Kain suggested that a better partner might have been Microsoft, although Facebook has been assiduous in its assurances that it sees Oculus as a strategic acquisition to broaden its portfolio beyond its eponymous social network, rather than a hardware solution to add virtuality to cat pictures, Buzzfeed quiz results and inappropriate accounts of Bacchanalian revels from coworkers and parents.\n\nContacted for comment, Oculus VR's PR representation gave this statement.\n\nIt's unfortunate, but when there's this type of transaction, people come out of the woodwork with ridiculous and absurd claims. We intend to vigorously defend Oculus and its investors to the fullest extent.\n\nWith VR touted as the coming wave for gaming, entertainment and a range of other applications, the stakes here are interesting - and also perhaps indicative of the difficulties of a company moving so quickly from plucky garage startup to billion-dollar acquisition.\n\nCarmack, meanwhile, never one to mince words, has taken to Twitter, saying:\n\nNo work I have ever done has been patented. Zenimax owns the code that I wrote, but they don't own VR.\n\nThe distinction drawn here is important: if he took with him to Oculus code that he wrote, for example, to run Doom 3: BFG Edition while a full-time employee of ZeniMax, this would be a case of removing code owned by his employer. Whereas it would be much harder to demonstrate that a piece of patentable \"know-how\" (for example, on how to design the physical headset, or an interface layout optimized for virtual environments) was company property if no patent had been filed in the company's name. Much hinges on what is meant by \"technology and know-how\" in ZeniMax's statement.\n\nAs VR as a sector hots up, it is worth noting that nobody has yet brought an affordable, successful product to the market taking advantage of the commoditization in hardware that made the Oculus Rift prototype possible. With Sony charging hard with Project Morpheus, its own prototypical head-mounted display, further drama can be expected as the race to store shelves heats up. In fact, it is virtually inevitable.\n\nFollow me on Twitter here, and catch up with my Forbes blog here.",

  "latent_1550": "The following blog post, unless otherwise noted, was written by a member of Gamasutras community.\n\nThe thoughts and opinions expressed are those of the writer and not Gamasutra or its parent company.\n\n[this article by Ryan Henson Creighton is re-posted from the Untold Entertainment blog, which is awesome]\n\nIt's no secret that i love graphic adventure games. They're the reason why i'm in this industry today. i've worked on a number of them (including Jinx 3: Escape from Area Fitty-Two, Heads, Summer in Smallywood, Sissy's Magical Ponycorn Adventure, and the upcoming Spellirium), and have devoted considerable resources to developing UGAGS: the Untold Graphic Adventure Game System (our company's answer to SCUMM), which has helped me to build that list of games. i've also written lots of articles about the genre (check the \"Further Reading\" section at the bottom of this post!)\n\nThe UGAGS oeuvre to date.\n\nCall me a snob, but i like graphic adventure games for the mere fact that their characters have something going through their minds other than \"shoot\". i like that their plotlines boil down to more than just \"kill mans\" or \"glorm points\". And i like standing in a room in a graphic adventure game, alone with my thoughts, without having to worry about time limits or pyrotechnics wizzing past my face every few seconds. As Monkey Island creator Ron Gilbert put it during his Maniac Mansion postmortem at GDC 2010,\n\n\"The magic of an adventure game is staring at the screen, wondering what to do next. It's that quiet contemplation.\"\n\nWith the massive Kickstarter windfall for an unspecified graphic adventure game, Tim Schafer, Ron Gilbert and Double Fine proven that there is still a market and a fondness for the genre. That being said, there are some legitimate and persistent problems with graphic adventures. Here's a short list of the most common ones, and my thoughts on ways in which we, as graphic adventure game designers, can fix them.\n\n1. Not Knowing What to Do\n\nTrue, it's magical for a video game to leave you guessing, instead of ramming a tutorial down your throat at every turn like most modern games do. But if you get stuck enough, long enough, that magic turns to salty poop and you really just want to get unstuck. If the only recourse for the player to get unstuck is to consult GameFAQs, you've failed as a designer. i've abandoned numerous graphic adventure games because i \"cheated\"; solving the rest of the game became a lot less enjoyable and i gave up, thoroughly racked with guilt-derived stomach cramps.\n\nThrow the bridle on the snake to turn it into Pegasus. Why oh WHY didn't i think of that??\n\nBut if the game gives you a way to cheat, or to get a hint, it's somehow legit and i don't feel as bad. It's game-sanctioned cheating - a subtle, but powerful, difference. Modern graphic adventure games like Machinarium use an in-game help system.\n\nMachinarium puts you through a twitch-based minigame before giving you a hint.\n\nAnother interesting way to handle this is to design your game such that the player can never get stuck. You just plod through the game, missing cues left and right, until you crash into the inevitable, unsatisfactory ending. But if you're keen and clever and aware, you can strike out off the beaten path, do all the difficult things, and get a much better ending. Games that use this approach include Kult/Chamber of the Sci-Mutant Priestess, The Last Express, and The Colonel's Bequest.\n\nIt's possible to coast through The Last Express without ever figuring out whodunit, whatsgoingon, or whosthatladywiththegun\n\nOne year at GDC, i heard a woman speak who was an advocate for female gamers (if you know her name, speak up!) Her heartfelt conviction, ladies, is that if you buy a game and you can't access all of the content on the disc because the designer won't let you, take the game back to the store and ask for your money back. Years ago, this struck me as utter blasphemy ... and yet here i am, developing Spellirium so that all of the challenges are no-fail, and you can sail through the game from beginning to end without the game requiring you to be awesome. It's awesome-optional. But for those players who DO excel, there are treats and rewards.\n\n2. The Pixel Hunt\n\nWhen graphic adventure games moved from using text-based parsers to entirely mouse-driven interfaces, they were distinguished from their parser predecessors by the term \"point n' click\". This term was later twisted to the pejorative \"hunt n' peck\" because numerous graphic adventure games, in lieu of offering clever and interesting puzzles, would hide important items in a 2-pixel-square hit area so that the player's only recourse was to slowly scan each and every location by trawling the cursor slowly over the screen in rows, like he was a human dot matrix printer. Listen: i could be a very rich man today if i had built HOGs (Hidden Object Games). They're immensely popular. But the entire genre is based on this one terrible flaw of graphic adventure games. HOGs, by definition, are pixel hunts. i can't do it. i just ... no. You know?\n\nFinding the pair of tweezers in the messy bedroom is not my definition of a fun time - it's my definition of every goddamn day of my life\n\nHow do you fix this problem? The obvious answer is to make bigger hit areas. But i've seen other games go even farther. Telltale's Back to the Future on the iPad enables you to multi-finger diddle the screen to make all of the location's hotspots light up. Like the \"every player's a winner\" strategy i mentioned above, this seemed too broad and too giving. i mean, the game might as well be playing itself at this point, right?\n\nThe more i thought about it, the more i thought back to adventure games where the only reason i got hopelessly stuck was because i didn't know that that part of the screen was an exit to another location. The joy of an adventure game should be in being a character, playing through a story, and feeling clever for solving some problems - not in discovering that you can click that plant that looks like it's part of the background.\n\n3. Cock-Blocking\n\nOne of the most despised phrases in the annals of graphic adventure gaming is \"you can't do that -- at least not now\" which, if you've played through the King's Quest series, you've read at least a few hundred times in your miserable existence. Graphic adventure game cock-blocking occurs when the designer has not thought through enough interaction possibilities, and has thrown up a vague, generic message to the player. This is essentially computer programming error code handling, with messaging that's barely more helpful than actual computer programming error codes.\n\nThe reason why cock-blocking is so common is that it takes a lot of effort to account for every possible thing the player might try to do. Indeed, for games with a text parser, it's nigh-impossible for the designer to anticipate every single combination of words, including gibberish, the player may hurl at the parser. With verb-based adventure interfaces like the one in Maniac Mansion, the permutations shrunk significantly.\n\nSidenote: this is the exact moment in Maniac Mansion when the majority of players wet their pants.\n\nA corollary to item use cock-blocking is a situation where the player tries to use a long, rigid item to pry something off another something, but he doesn't use the correct long, rigid item that the designer was thinking of. Stick - no good. Pole - no good. Broom handle - ding ding ding! Here's how graphic adventure developer and wittily snarky pundit Ben \"Yahtzee\" Croshaw puts it in his Depressingly Common Adventure Game Design Flaws series (the rest of which i've avoided reading, for fear of being wittily snarked at for plagiarism):\n\n\"The best game I have ever played for intuitive puzzles has to be the aforementioned Zak McKracken And The Alien Mindbenders. There's a whole horde of inventory items in Zak McKrack, and I could give a thousand examples of puzzles with several alternative solutions. How about using a monkey wrench to wake up the bus driver, but also being able to do the same with any other long, hard item in your inventory, AND having the option of waking him with a merry kazoo interlude instead? You can use a butter knife to get a cashcard from under a desk, but you can also use any of the several pieces of paper, all of which can also be used for drawing maps. Then, when you try to lever up floorboards with the butter knife, it's obviously too flimsy, and you get left with a bent butter knife. Having so many possibilities and so many avenues to explore not only constantly rewarded the player's intelligence but provided the vital encouragement needed to make them push through to the very end.\"\n\nBefore Spellirium, UGAGS games got right around this problem by not offering any item interaction whatsoever. If you clicked on a hotspot, and you had the inventory item that interacted with it, you automatically used the right item. In Jinx 3, if you were carrying the spork, you could tap on the prison wall with it. If you held the banana, you could flush it down the toilet to create a flood. This covered off any puzzle design blunders that i may have committed. Left to his own devices, would the player really know he should tap on the wall with the spork? With auto-item use, i never had to worry about it.\n\nWhy force the player to say \"use keycard on door\" when the interaction is obvious?\n\nSince you can use items on hotspots in Spellirium, i've developed a new system to minimize cock-blocking. Given a hotspot like a locked door, i can obviously define what happens when you use the iron key on it. But i can also list other items the player might try to use, like the metal pole (to bash the door down?), and i can have Todd respond in kind: \"This metal pole is too flimsy to bash the door down.\" That makes the player feel good, because i'm acknowledging that he had a good idea, and it's so much more satisfying than \"i don't understand that\" or \"i can't do that.\"\n\nThe next line of defense is generic item commands. If i haven't written an item-specific response, the logic falls through to the hotspot's generic response, like \"i can't use that to get through the door.\" This is a little more frustrating than a specifically-written response, but at least it's something. One game that i noticed did a LOT of work to provide an item-specific response for every imaginable item/hotspot combination is The Whispered World. Very well done.\n\n4. No - Not THAT Paper\n\nA very common and frustrating mistake that adventure games make is to send the player off in search of something that is represented in the background artwork, but the background element is not wired for interaction. While it's not a graphic adventure game, i was recently playing the abysmal Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword, and a character asked me to go find a piece of paper - \"ANY piece of paper\". The setting for this fetch quest was an academy packed to the teats with books, parchments, scrolls and papers of every imaginable kind ... but i couldn't pick any of them up. i had to go hunt down the exact piece of paper the game wanted me to find.\n\nDon't surround the player with non-interactive books, and then ask him to find \"any\" piece of paper.\n\nA related problem is the too-damned-interesting-background-art error. This is where you have something in the background that every player clicks on, but you haven't written a description for it. And the player figures there MUST be something up with that video camera hidden in the plant. But there's not.\n\nIn an attempt to address this, we're developing a heatmap system for Spellirium where we can analyze players' clicks. If we notice enough heat on a particular area of the screen that we haven't wired up for interactivity, of if there's a hotspot that gets clicked non-proportionally to its relevance, we know we have some splainin' to do to the player.\n\nHeatmaps: they're not just for Halo any more.\n\n5. The Pointless Conversation Option\n\nAgain, while it's not a graphic adventure game, there's a lot we can learn from the steaming pile that is Skyward Sword. Throughout the game, non-player characters ask you to make a choice. \"Link! Will you save my kitten from the tree?\" You know that, as the hero, you kind of have to save the kitten. Yet you're given the option to say \"No.\" And when you do that, the story does not move forward. You MUST re-engage the NPC. You MUST say \"Yes\" this time. You MUST save the kitten. What was the point of the interaction, other than providing the illusion of interactivity?\n\nThe reason why designers do this is, of course, to save work - a LOT of work. If, whenever you made a binary decision, the ramifications spun off wildly into two alternate timelines, you'd be building an impossibly large game. But i can't stand it when it's obvious during a conversation that no matter what i \"choose\" to say, the conversation is always going to go a certain way.\n\nThe solution is a trick of good creative writing. It's fine for the conversation to always lead into the same funnel. It's not fine for the player to know that. Through clever writing, you can make the player think he's affecting the conversation, even when he's not. If you're crafty, you can even give the player a binary decision with two seemingly opposite inputs, but steer them both around to the same outcome. Consider this conversation snippet from Spellirium between Todd and Lorms:\n\nTodd:\n\nUh ... okay. You can tag along, I guess. [C1]\n\nIt's probably better if I go alone. [C1]\n\n[C1] (Todd walks to the edge of the screen)\n\nLorms: Where are you going?\n\nTodd: I dunno. That way?\n\nLorms: Do you have a plan? Do you even know how you're going to find your friends?\n\nWith one option, the player decides that Lorms can come with him. With the other option, the player decides to go it alone. Lorms is one of Spellirium's main characters. Make no mistake: he's coming on the journey. But despite what the player chooses, he feels like the game is honouring his choice, and the conversation and actions that flow from that point feel natural - even if the player chooses two completely opposite responses.\n\nThe Sins of Our Fathers\n\nThe graphic adventure game genre is far from perfect, but there are many things we can do as savvy designers to account for the crimes perpetrate on players past. We have been bad, but we will atone. But will it be enough to resurrect a genre that's been on life support for the past twenty years?\n\nFurther Reading",

The two teams are different now and the set-ups are different. Clubs change from year to year.\n\n“We had a great result in the derby at Anfield last season but we can’t rely on what we’ve achieved in these fixtures previously. This side need to make their own derby history.”\n\nSummer signings Dejan Lovren, Javier Manquillo, Alberto Moreno, Adam Lallana and Mario Balotelli are all expected to start against the Blues. Lazar Markovic could also get the nod.\n\nRodgers insists they all have sufficient experience to be able to handle the size of the occasion.\n\nAt the age of 20, Manquillo is the youngest of Liverpool’s derby debutants but he lined up for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid last season.\n\n“All the players are well aware of what’s at stake,” Rodgers said.\n\n“We’ve spoken about it. They know about the history of this club and what the derby games mean.\n\n“This is a really special derby and any of our players playing in it for the first time will be ready and prepared.\n\n“They have all played in big games elsewhere so I have no concerns about that.”\n\nWith Daniel Sturridge highly unlikely to be fit enough to start, there will be plenty of responsibility resting on Balotelli’s shoulders.\n\nThe £16million frontman has yet to get off the mark in the Premier League with his new club and this would the perfect day to put that right.\n\nLiverpool will need Balotelli to keep his cool amid the white-hot atmosphere but Rodgers says that’s a message he has reinforced to his entire squad.\n\nTwenty players have been sent off in the 44 Premier League derbies but there hasn’t been a red card issued in the last six meetings in all competitions.\n\n“There hasn’t been any special talk for Mario, it was a generic one,” Rodgers said.\n\n“They all understand and respect that we need to ensure we keep 11 men on the field.\n\n“You’ve got to be competitive, you’ve got to be strong but you need to also have that composure. It’s vitally important that we keep that.”\n\nTime has been spent at Melwood this week trying to iron out Liverpool’s problems when it comes to defending set-pieces.\n\nThat glaring weakness has proved costly against Aston Villa, West Ham and Middlesbrough over the past fortnight and Rodgers expects to see an improvement against the Blues.\n\n“We have looked at it this week. It’s certainly been an area of frustration for us so far,” Rodgers said.\n\n“Our organisation is actually good in the set-piece but it’s about reinforcing principles that are set in place on a weekly basis.\n\n“It’s something we have specifically looked at and an area the players will cope with.\n\n“It comes down to concentration and thinking under pressure. That’s critical from set-pieces.”\n\nEverton have only scored seven goals in their last 14 league trips across Stanley Park and haven’t netted in the first half of an Anfield derby since 2000.\n\nBut in Romelu Lukaku they boast a powerful striker with an impressive record against the Reds.\n\nThe Belgium international has scored four goals in his last four league appearances against Rodgers’ men, including a double in the thrilling 3-3 derby draw at Goodison last November.\n\nRodgers needs Lovren and likely centre-back partner Martin Skrtel to keep close tabs on him.\n\n“Lukaku is a good player, who scored in their last league game against Crystal Palace,” he said.\n\n“He’s a talent and a threat when he’s running forward on to the ball.\n\n“We have to deal with that and we know we need to be stronger defensively.”\n\nLast season was heralded as the start of an exciting new era for this fixture with both managers firmly committed to attacking football.\n\nTwo memorable contests produced 10 goals and with both backlines having struggled so far this term another open game looks inevitable.\n\nRodgers wants his players to be bold and positive but says Liverpool’s preparations have also involved plenty of homework on how to negate Everton FC's threat.\n\n“I worry about how we play but I always respect the opponent,” he added,\n\n“We do a lot of analysis and a lot of work on the opponent.\n\n“Of course our players will always go into the game with great confidence and belief that if we can bring our movement patterns and our quality into the game then it will make it really difficult for the opponent.\n\n“But I can’t say that it’s just solely about us. Yeah, the focus and the confidence I give the players can make them feel that but we also do a lot of our homework\n\n“That was another key to our success last season. We imposed our style on teams, but that was after we had done our work to understand where opponents were strong and areas where we felt we could exploit.\n\n“In some games we pressed the ball really high up the field to win it back, sometimes we offered the opponent the ball so we could counter-attack in the spaces behind.\n\n“Those elements tactically are important for us. To order to get them right you have to understand and respect the other team and how they work.\n\n“We’ve worked well this week and now we need to produce. We always expect to do well at Anfield.”",
  "latent_1739": "16.03.2014\n\nОт редакции: Через сто лет после начала Первой мировой войны, когда захватившие власть украинские националисты, Путин, Евросоюз и США вместе поставили Европу на грань нового конфликта, LIVA публикует самую известную антивоенную речь Жана Жореса – выдающегося французского социалиста, основателя и редактора газеты «Юманите».\n\n25 июля 1914 года, выступая на митинге в пригороде Лиона, Жорес подробно описал, насколько реальным является военный кошмар, и какими катастрофическими явятся его последствия. В эти дни Франция, как и вся остальная Европа, оказалась охваченной шовинистической истерией. Антивоенная позиция Жореса сделала его объектом жестокой травли, к которой с готовностью присоединились многие из его бывших товарищей – социалистов и профсоюзных лидеров. Тесное сотрудничество с немецкими социал-демократами стоило ему прозвища «Герр Жорес». 31 июля 1914 года, через шесть дней после последней речи Жореса, националист Рауль Виллен застрелил левого журналиста в парижском кафе. Убийство встретило восторженные отклики в патриотических кругах, и впоследствии Виллен был оправдан судом, который счел уничтожение противника войны «вкладом в победу».\n\nПо словам Пуанкаре, «священный союз французских политических партий возник в крови Жореса», которого называют первой жертвой Первой мировой войны. Однако уже вскоре, когда военная мясорубка начала перемалывать в окопах миллионы людей, его речь получила широкую популярность. Переведенная на разные языки, она нелегально распространялись меньшинством левых социалистов, выступивших против «оборончества» и социал-шовинизма, под лозунгом: «главный враг – в своей стране».\n\nВ 1936 году Рауль Виллен был расстрелян испанскими республиканцами по обвинению в шпионаже. К тому времени тело Жореса покоилось в Пантеоне Франции. Сегодня, век спустя, его антивоенная речь по-прежнему сохраняет свою актуальность для народов Украины, России, Европы и всего мира.\n\n«Не пройдет и шести месяцев, как начнется война. Я получаю столько писем с угрозами, и я не удивился бы, если бы оказался ее первой жертвой. Я прощаю того, кто меня убьет. Виновными будут те, кто даст ему оружие…».\n\nЖан Жорес\n\nГраждане,\n\nЯ должен вам сегодня заявить, что никогда еще мы не переживали такого, что никогда еще Европа за последние сорок лет не переживала более угрожающего и трагического положения, чем в этот час, когда я взял на себя ответственность перед вами выступить. Ах, граждане! Я не хочу сгущать краски, я не хочу утверждать, что разрыв дипломатических отношений между Австрией и Сербией, о котором стало известно всего полчаса назад, непременно означает начало войны между Австрией и Сербией. И я не хочу утверждать, что, если начнется война между Австрией и Сербией, конфликт непременно распространится на всю Европу. Но я утверждаю, что и нам, и всеобщему миру, и жизни миллионов людей угрожает страшная опасность, для отражения которой пролетарии Европы должны приложить все усилия, проявить всю солидарность, на какую они только способны.\n\nГраждане, австрийская нота Сербии полна угроз, и если Австрия вторгнется на славянскую землю, если германцы, если германская раса, населяющая Австрию, прибегнет к насилию против сербов, которые составляют часть славянского мира и которым славяне России глубоко сочувствуют, то есть все основания думать и опасаться, что Россия примет участие в конфликте. А если Россия выступит в защиту Сербии против Австрии, Австрия, столкнувшись с двумя противниками, Сербией и Россией, потребует выполнения союзнического договора, связывающего ее с Германией. А Германия через своих послов сообщила всем державам, что она солидаризируется с Австрией. Так что, если конфликт не ограничится Австрией и Сербией, если вмешается Россия, Германия займет свое место на полях сражения рядом с Австрией. А тогда вступит в действие не только соглашение между Австрией и Германией, но и тайное соглашение между Россией и Францией, основные пункты которого известны, и Россия скажет Франции: «Против меня выступили два противника, Германия и Австрия, и я вправе потребовать выполнения связывающего нас договора, Франция обязана занять свое место рядом со мной». Положение сейчас таково, что, быть может, уже завтра Австрия нападет на сербов, а если Австрия и Германия нападут на сербов и на русских, вся Европа будет в огне, весь мир будет в огне.\n\nВ такой грозный час, исполненный опасности для всех нас, для всех отечеств, я не стану долго задерживаться на том, кто несет за это ответственность. Большая доля ответственности ложится и на нас, на Францию, как говорил уже Муте, и я свидетельствую перед историей, что мы это предвидели, мы предостерегали. Когда мы говорили, что насильственное, вооруженное вторжение в Марокко открывает эру честолюбия, алчности и конфликтов в Европе, нас клеймили, называя плохими французами, а на самом деле именно мы пеклись о Франции.\n\nВот, увы, наша доля ответственности – и она становится особенно очевидной, если вспомнить, что именно вопрос о Боснии и Герцеговине явился причиной раздоров между Австрией и Сербией. И что мы, французы, когда Австрия аннексировала Боснию и Герцеговину, не имели ни права, ни возможности этому воспротивиться, ибо сами увязли в Марокко, и рассчитывали добиться прощения наших собственных грехов, прощая грехи своим ближним.\n\nТогда наш министр иностранных дел сказал Австрии: «Мы будем смотреть сквозь пальцы на аннексию Боснии и Герцеговины, если вы будете смотреть сквозь пальцы на захват Марокко», и с такими же покаянными речами мы обошли все державы, все нации. Мы говорили Италии: «Можешь отправляться в Триполитанию, поскольку я обосновалась в Марокко; можешь грабить на том конце улицы, поскольку я граблю на этом».\n\nКаждый народ шествовал по улицам Европы со своим маленьким факелом, и вот теперь мы дождались пожара. Что ж, граждане, на нас лежит доля ответственности, но она не снимает ответственности с других, и мы вправе и обязаны разоблачать, с одной стороны, коварство и грубость германской дипломатии, а с другой – двуличие дипломатии русской. Русские, которые, надо думать, встанут на сторону сербов, несомненно, скажут: «Сердце великого славянского народа не стерпит, чтобы творили насилие над маленьким славянским народом Сербии». Да, но кто же нанес Сербии удар в самое сердце? Когда Россия вмешалась в балканские дела в 1877 году и когда она создала якобы независимую Болгарию, решив прибрать ее к рукам, она сказала Австрии: «Не мешай мне, и я отдам под твое управление Боснию и Герцеговину». А управление, вы сами понимаете, что это значит на языке дипломатов; и с того самого дня, как Австро-Венгрия получила разрешение управлять Боснией и Герцеговиной, у нее была одна лишь забота – управлять ею в своих интересах.\n\nВо время свидания русского министра иностранных дел с австрийским министром иностранных дел Россия заявила Австрии: «Я позволю тебе аннексировать Боснию и Герцеговину, если ты не будешь препятствовать мне получить выход к Черному морю поблизости от Константинополя». Господин Эренталь сделал жест, который Россия приняла за знак согласия и разрешила Австрии захватить Боснию и Герцеговину. А когда Австрия прикарманила Боснию и Герцеговину, Россия сказала Австрии: «А теперь мой черед с Черным морем». – «Как? Что? Ничего подобного я вам не говорил», – и с тех пор Россия и Австрия, господин Извольский, министр иностранных дел России, и господин Эренталь, министр иностранных дел Австрии, в ссоре; но Россия была соучастницей Австрии, она предала славян Боснии и Герцеговины Австро-Венгрии и вонзила нож в сердце сербских славян. Это и привело ее на тот путь, по которому она следует теперь.\n\nЕсли бы все тридцать лет, если с того времени, как Австрия управляет Боснией и Герцеговиной, она бы пеклась о благе населяющих ее народов, Европа не переживала бы нынешних затруднений, но клерикальная Австрия угнетала Боснию и Герцеговину, подвергая гонениям ее веру. Она хотела силой обратить ее в католичество и навлекла на себя недовольство живущих там народов.\n\nТак колониальная политика Франции, двуличная политика России и грубая воля Австрии способствовали созданию ужасного положения, в котором мы оказались. Европа мечется, как в кошмаре.\n\nЧто ж, граждане, в обступившем нас мраке, в полной неизвестности о том, что ждет нас завтра, я не хочу произносить никаких широковещательных деклараций; несмотря на все, я еще надеюсь, что сама грандиозность грозящей нам катастрофы заставит правительства в последнюю минуту одуматься, и нам не придется содрогаться от ужаса при мысли о бедствии, каким явится для человечества в наши дни европейская война.\n\nМы имеем перед глазами пример Балканской войны: на полях сражения, на госпитальных койках погибла чуть ли не целая армия; выступило трехсоттысячное войско, а оставило оно на полях сражений, в придорожных канавах и на койках тифозных госпиталей сто тысяч человек из трехсот тысяч.\n\nПредставьте же себе масштабы катастрофы в Европе: тут уже мы будем иметь дело не с армией в триста тысяч человек, как на Балканах, но с четырьмя, пятью, шестью армиями по два миллиона каждая. Какое это будет массовое истребление, кровопролитие, опустошение, варварство! Вот почему, когда над нами уже нависла грозовая туча, мне хочется верить, что преступление не совершится. Граждане, если буря грянет, все мы, социалисты, позаботимся о том, чтобы возможно скорее спастись от преступления, которое совершили правители. А пока что, если осталось время, если осталось хотя бы несколько часов, мы удвоим усилия, чтобы предотвратить катастрофу. Уже в «Форвертсе» наши германские товарищи поднимают негодующий голос протеста против ноты Австрии, и, насколько мне известно, созвано наше Международное социалистическое бюро.\n\nКак бы то ни было, граждане, и я говорю это с каким-то даже отчаянием: в час, когда нам угрожает убийство и варварство, у нас имеется лишь одна возможность сохранить мир и спасти цивилизацию – пролетариат должен сплотить все свои силы, насчитывающие великое множество братьев – французы, англичане, немцы, итальянцы, русские. Мы призываем эти десятки тысяч людей объединиться с тем, чтобы единодушное биение их сердец развеяло страшный кошмар!\n\nЯ сгорел бы со стыда, граждане, если бы среди вас нашелся хотя один человек, который мог бы подумать, что я пытаюсь сыграть на этих драматических событиях с целью обеспечить социалистам победу на выборах, как бы ни важна была такая победа. Но я вправе сказать вам, что долг велит нам, велит вам всем не пренебрегать малейшей возможностью продемонстрировать свое единодушие с интернациональной социалистической партией, представляющей в этот предгрозовой час единственную надежду на возможность мира, на восстановление мира.\n\nЖан Жорес\n\nЧитайте по теме:\n\nЮджин Дебс.

  "latent_1808": "Chinese UN diplomat apologises to Secretary-General for tribute that turned into drunken rant\n\nThe UN's top Chinese official was forced to make a shame-faced apology after drunkenly ranting to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, it was revealed today.\n\nSha Zukang, the Under-Secretary-General for Economic and Social Affairs, was 'deeply apologetic' when he went to see the Secretary General the following morning, a UN spokesman said.\n\nHe made the comments after initially paying tribute to the UN leader at a retreat for senior staff , reportedly saying: 'I know you never liked me Mr Secretary General - well, I never liked you, either.\n\nDrunken rant: Sha Zukang, left, was delivering a toast to UN staff paying tribute to Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon when he began to criticise his boss\n\n'I didn't want to come to New York. It was the last thing I wanted to do. But I've come to love the UN and I'm coming to admire some things about you.\n\nAccording to the Daily Telegraph, the 62-year-old added: 'You've been trying to get rid of me. You can fire me any time, you can fire me today.'\n\nThe 15 minute-long speech at the Austrian ski resort of Alpbach also singled out American colleague Bob Orr, from the executive office of the secretary-general.\n\n'I really don't like him: he's an American and I really don't like Americans,' he said.\n\n'He said that he had risen to speak the previous evening because he felt that recent criticisms of the Secretary-General had been unfair and that he wanted to set the record straight', spokesman Farhan Haq said.\n\nBut Mr Sha told Mr Ban he realised the way he spoke, 'coming as it did after he had had a few drinks, was inappropriate, as it went too far', Mr Haq said.\n\n'He was also aware that his statements had embarrassed and irritated other senior advisors.'\n\nSha Zukang was appointed to the UN by China in 2007 and is no stranger to controversy.\n\nIn a BBC interview in 2006, he launched a bizarre attack on the U.S. saying: 'It's high time to shut up.'",
  "latent_1952": "A big fight is brewing over a little fish — a fish that no one wants to eat but that many regard as the most important in the sea.\n\nCatch restrictions loom on menhaden, which is too unsavory to grace a dinner plate but much sought by commercial fishermen. They catch them in staggering numbers to be ground into animal feed, to extract their heart-healthy oils for humans and to be used as bait to catch other fish, including Maryland's iconic blue crabs.\n\nMenhaden also play a vital role in the Chesapeake Bay's ecosystem, feeding on plankton and serving themselves as food for many of the fish, birds and animals that people do eat or care about.\n\n\"They're a keystone species,\" says biologist Paul Spitzer of Trappe. Besides feeding other fish, menhaden are a staple for seabirds such as ospreys, gannets and common loons. When the fish are scarce, he says, it affects the health and abundance of other creatures as well.\n\nNow, driven by a warning from scientists that menhaden levels are perilously low, an interstate panel that regulates fishing from Maine to Florida is weighing a range of actions that could reduce the commercial harvest of the fish by as much as 45 percent all along the coast, including in Maryland.\n\nThe proposal, to be taken up Nov. 9 at a meeting in Boston of the Atlantic States Marine Fisheries Commission, is being hailed by recreational anglers and conservationists alike, who've long voiced concerns about menhaden levels, and say other animals that depend on them for food, such as highly prized striped bass, are suffering from malnourishment.\n\n\"We fished the stock down many decades ago, and have maintained a heavy enough fishing pressure that we've held it at a fairly low level,\" said William Goldsborough, senior scientist with the Chesapeake Bay Foundation and one of three Maryland members on the fisheries commission. It's time to leave more menhaden in the water and give them a chance to increase, he said.\n\nBut the proposal before the commission has drawn pushback from commercial fishermen in Maryland and elsewhere, who contend the science shows there's no cause for alarm and any cutback will hurt an already diminished livelihood.\n\n\"This is the last thing we've got is menhaden,\" says Larry \"Boo\" Powley of Hoopers Island, one of about 100 fishermen in Maryland who catch the fish in a pound net, a fencelike arrangement of anchored nets that lure them into a trap.\n\nA third-generation netter, Powley, 58, and his crew of four supply the bulk of their catch to crabbers on the island for bait. If rules cut his haul back by a fifth or more, as the panel is considering, Powley warns he'll leave his boat at the dock because he won't be able to make a go of it anymore.\n\nNowhere is opposition more intense than in Virginia, home to a fleet that hauls in 80 percent of all the menhaden caught along the Atlantic Coast. Bait fishermen such as Powley account for the other 20 percent.\n\nReedville, the picturesque town on Virginia's Northern Neck where Omega Protein Inc. processes its fleet's harvest, is the second busiest fishing port in the United States (after Dutch Harbor, Alaska) by the weight of the harvest landed there.\n\nLast year, Omega hauled in 183,000 metric tons of menhaden, according to fisheries commission data, an increase of 27 percent from the year before. About 40 percent came from the Virginia waters of the bay — the so-called \"reduction\" fishing fleet isn't permitted to work in Maryland.\n\n\"I think menhaden are already getting a high level of protection,\" Ron Lukens, Omega's chief fisheries biologist, said at a meeting last week in Anne Arundel County of a panel attempting to advise the commission on its decision.\n\nWith representatives from Omega, Virginia and New Jersey insisting no change is needed, the group reached no consensus.\n\nA nationwide group of 75 scientists, however, says menhaden need greater protection, in part so they can fulfill their role as water filters and food source for other fish and animals.\n\nScientists reviewing the fisheries commission's latest assessment of the menhaden stock noted that the population has fallen over the last 25 years, to the point that they're now only 8 percent of their historic level. Overfishing occurred in 32 of the last 54 years, the study concluded, including 2008, the most recent year studied.\n\nOmega's spokesman, Ben Landry, says those numbers are deceptive. The menhaden catch exceeded the commission's harvest threshold only once in the last 10 years, he points out, and then only slightly. The population is not overfished, he said, and with an estimated 18 trillion eggs produced in 2008, there's no danger of collapse.\n\nOmega employs 300 people on its nine-vessel fishing fleet and in its processing factory at Reedville, Landry says, and has invested $28 million to $30 million upgrading its plant in the past eight years.\n\nVirginia politicians have moved to shield the company with a law removing oversight of menhaden from the Virginia Marine Resources Commission, an appointed body which oversees all other fisheries.\n\nMore than 600 people attended 13 hearings held along the coast by the interstate commission, and the panel received more than 30,000 written comments, many calling for greater protections.\n\n\"All of us who've been on the bay for a number of years can recall in years gone by huge areas of menhaden feeding on the surface of the bay,\" says Kenneth Lewis, 78, an avid fisherman from Towson. \"Nobody has seen that for quite a long time,\" he said.\n\nOmega's spokesman said the company is prepared to go along with the proposal to increase the menhaden population in the bay and along the coast to 15 percent of historic levels. If that threshold were in effect now, it would require a 23 percent reduction in harvest from last year's catch.\n\nBut many recreational anglers, scientists and conservationists are pressing the commission to set a target of preserving up to 40 percent of the spawning stock in any given year — which could lead to a cutback in commercial harvest of 45 percent.\n\nOmega's spokesman calls that idea \"reckless and unnecessary,\" but advocates contend the role of menhaden in feeding other fish and birds demands steeper reductions in the commerical harvest.",
  "latent_2058": "US scientists have devised a new way of storing and delivering vulnerable antibiotics and vaccines, with a little help from the silk moth. Infectious diseases kill millions of children every year, and continue to do so in the developing world more than two decades after the World Health Organisation, Unicef and charities such as Rotary International launched a campaign to eliminate polio and immunise every child against the six biggest killers.\n\nCivil war, corruption, ignorance and poverty all created problems, but one of the biggest is simply the fragile nature of vaccines: they tend to deteriorate rapidly unless kept in the refrigerator. This is a problem even for Britain's National Health Service. It is a much bigger problem in hot, humid regions without clinics, electricity or clean water – those regions where children are most at risk from mumps, measles and rubella, from gastric infections and pulmonary diseases, and where the wild polio virus still presents a threat.\n\nTwo researchers from Massachusetts report in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences that they took a closer look at the curious properties of the proteins made by the Bombyx mori, which spins a commercially useful little cocoon that must withstand rain and dramatic temperature changes and protect vulnerable organisms. They identified components of the silk that were strong, moisture-resistant, biocompatible and stable at high temperatures, and began experimenting with new ways of conserving MMR vaccines and penicillin in gels, matrices and tiny pockets of silk. The latest news is that, after six months at 37C and even 45C, the experimental silk-wrapped vaccines were still potent. This is a technology still to be tested in the field, but if it works it could replace the costly, cumbersome and precarious \"cold chain\" of delivery from manufacturer to mobile village clinic.\n\nThere are three lessons to be drawn. One is that science can help the poorest: sickness and suffering hamper development as much as corruption, poverty and natural hazard. The second is that the phrase \"natural capital\" is not just a truism: it is palpably true. People have been exploiting the magic mix of mulberry, moth and silken cocoon for thousands of years, but clearly the silkworm has much more to tell us.\n\nThe third is that entomologists had to ask questions about insect life cycles; materials scientists had to explore the polymer chemistry of living tissue; and engineers with a background in biology had to experiment with fabrics fashioned by millions of years of trial-and-error evolution and invent a science called biomimetics. Finally, somebody had to recognise a solution in search of a problem. Pure science pays dividends – unpredictably, but dividends all the same.",
  "latent_2082": "Origin of Pilsner\n\nIn the Western Bohemian city of Pilsen (Plzeň) in the Czech Republic, the beer-loving citizens were fed up with the lack of quality in their local brew, so they looked for help in neighboring Germany—specifically Bavaria—where the brewers had already earned a reputation as master beer makers. Brewmaster Josef Groll was hired to take on the task of creating a new Bohemian beer brewed with Bavarian quality. Groll chose to brew a beer using local Czech ingredients—sweet and nutty Moravian malt and lightly bitter but aromatic Saaz hops—combined with lager yeast imported from Bavaria. The Moravian malt was made in a new type of kiln which used indirect heat to produce very pale malt, and when combined with Pilsen’s naturally soft water resulted in the world’s first pale lager. In October 1842, this combination of circumstances—history, location, and technology—created a style which would grow to dominate the beer world for more than a century.",
  "latent_2103": "If you’ve ever enjoyed some lazy afternoons just sitting on the rug, passing greasy controllers around, and occasionally blowing into the business end of a Nintendo cartridge, then you know what we’re talking about here. We’re talking about the best old-school video games of all time. Here goes nothing:\n\n13. Super Mario Bros 2. There are two kinds of people in this world: those who loved Mario 2 and those who hated it. If you hated it, you just couldn’t get past all the turnip-digging and carrot-tossing. If you loved it, you picked Princess, flew through all the levels, defeated all the egg-spitting ostrich bosses, dusted your palms together, and you called it a day. Of course, there was always that massive sense of disappointment when the end credits revealed that the entire game was just a dream Mario had one night. What a bummer.\n\n12. Wolfenstein 3D. Wolfenstein really blew open the whole world of first-person shooters back in 1992. It was just you, a bunch of Nazis, and a maze of neverending hallways. Sounds scary, but you’d be fine as long as you ate enough turkey drumsticks before battling Robot Hitler. Mein leben!\n\n11. Street Fighter 2. This game really evened the odds between the older brother, with the thick glasses and the calloused thumbs, and the kid sister, with the overalls and toothy aw-shucks grin. Because that kid sister, that Nintendo novice, that rookie who never played video games, well she could just go on a hot streak of straightup neverending E. Honda hundred-hand-slaps and there really wasn’t anything the older brother could do about it. Except possibly pull her hair until she started crying. Sorry, Nina.\n\n10. Duck hunt. The great-great-grandfather of the Nintendo Wii would have to be Duck Hunt, where you used the plastic plugged-in gun to learn how to hunt. Now, who else walked right up the TV in frustration and killed every duck from two inches away? You practically had to when that invincible dog started laughing at you. There was no choice. Plus, how else could you train for clay shooting?\n\n9. Bubble Bobble. An afternoon falling through the Bubble Bobble levels was like acid tripping for a six-year old. The music got wilder and wilder as you and a pal continuously slaughtered robots by suffocating them in your dangerous dinosaur-spewed bubbles and then eating their dead corpses which, after you popped them, magically turned into shiny pieces of fruit. Somehow this all made sense, too. We must’ve been high on Pixy Stix.\n\n8. Pong. Distributed exclusively by Sears for $100 a pop during the 1975 Christmas season, Pong eventually burned its way into hearts and television screens across the world.\n\n7. Mike Tyson’s Punch Out. Before rape, prison, and facial tattoos, Mike Tyson starred in an animated game for children. You played as Little Mac and worked your way up the circuit by pummeling boxers like Glass Joe, Bald Bull, Mr. Sandman, and eventually Mike Tyson himself. The characters were great and Mario even moonlighted as the referee here, once again showing his tremendous versatility and athleticism.\n\n6. Sonic The Hedgehog. Sonic was a great game to play when you went over to your friend’s house and they had Sega instead of Nintendo. Why did they have Sega instead of Nintendo? Well, it was either for the sports games or the blood in Mortal Kombat, one of the two.\n\n5. Tetris. If you were lucky, you could get away with telling your parents that Tetris was educational. It certainly looked like it was too, with all that falling geometry and the Kremlin backdrops. Though no one could really prove it, there sure was something suspiciously mathy about it. Of course, the greatest thing about Tetris was that you could just blame the game when you died. Those random shapes turned us all into hollow-eyed fatalists, left staring blankly into the television, shaking our heads and saying “I was just waiting for a line” over and over again.\n\n4. Solitaire in Windows 3.0. Solitaire was that classic boring card game that you played by yourself when the boss wasn’t looking. It’s funny because almost everyone who finds it strangely addictive admits that it is in fact a completely terrible game. But it sure was a good way to teach your grandpa how to use a mouse.\n\n3. Contra. Everyone talks about the famous Contra code that you entered during the startup screen to begin with 30 men but few people talk about how impossible this game was without the code. You had people shooting at you from all directions, you died after one bullet, and you started the game with only three lives. Even with the spray gun you probably only ran for about twenty seconds before getting shot and calling it quits. So basically, Contra taught us that bullets are really dangerous and that’s why cheating is important.\n\n2. Super Mario Bros. There are so many memories from this instant classic, like the creepy music in World 1-2, the warp zone, the hammer brothers, the flying fish, and the first time you ever heard the phrase: “Thank you Mario! But our princess is in another castle!”\n\n1. Super Mario Bros 3. Fred Savage helped Mario 3 launch to fame with the ninety-minute commercial known as The Wizard. Remember his catatonic little bro who just said ‘Cali-forn-yah’ the whole movie but eventually showed the world how to find the whistle? Yes, Mario 3 completely blew everything else away by introducing us to flying raccoons, angry suns, Tanooki and Frog suits, and that impossible Tube World. It was a larger than life video game that provided years of fun at birthday parties and sleepovers everywhere. For this last game, how about the original commercial instead of a clip? I believe it accurately captures how the world felt about this game.\n\nYes, playing old school video games was always a sure way to get sore thumbs, strained eyes, and a dry mouth. But would you trade anything for all those hours in front of the TV set exploring strange and exotic worlds with your friends? Yes, the sun would dip down, the lights would go off upstairs, the bowls of Doritos and cans of Pepsi would empty, but that bright, flickering light from the TV didn’t stop casting kaleidoscope shadows on the wide-eyed faces sitting three feet in front of them well into the night.\n\nAnd those were some seriously good times, my friend.\n\nSome seriously good times.\n\nAWESOME!\n\nPhotos from: here and here\n\nShare:",

  "latent_2507": "Theresa May has drawn on her childhood memories of growing up in an Oxfordshire vicarage to emphasise her Christian values, which she says “can and must bring us together” over Brexit.\n\nTheresa May condemns National Trust for axing 'Easter' from egg hunt Read more\n\nIn an Easter message posted on YouTube, the prime minister calls for British people to show compassion and a sense of community and citizenship, as well as tolerance of other religions, to meet the challenges and divisions caused by the decision to leave the EU.\n\n“Easter is a moment to reflect, and an important time for Christians and others to gather together with families and friends,” May, who is the daughter of a Church of England clergyman, says in the three-minute video.\n\n“This year, after a period of intense debate over the right future for our country, there is a sense that people are coming together and uniting behind the opportunities that lie ahead. For at heart, this country is one great union of people and nations with a proud history and a bright future. And as we face the opportunities ahead – the opportunities that stem from our decision to leave the EU, and embrace the world – our shared interests, our shared ambitions and, above all, our shared values can and must bring us together.”\n\nReacting to the message, Alastair Campbell, who famously said when working for Tony Blair that “we don’t do God”, suggested May should tread carefully when linking her faith to the political challenges facing the country. “I think even vicars’ daughters should be a little wary of allying their politics to their faith,” he said. “She does not exactly say if God had a vote he would have voted Leave, but she gets closer to it than she should. If she really thinks she is leading a united country full of hope ... I suggest she gets out more.”\n\nCampbell, who is now editor-at-large of the pro-EU weekly newspaper the New European, added: “I don’t think I have ever known Britain more divided. As for her talk of compassion, community, citizenship and obligations to one another, she has taken an axe to those with regard to Britain’s relations to the rest of the world, and plenty of her domestic agenda points in the opposite direction.”\n\nMay has stepped up references to her faith in recent months. Recently she lambasted Cadbury’s and the National Trust for supposedly downgrading the word “Easter” on packaging and promotional material. Describing the move as “ridiculous”, she emphasised her dual qualification for passing comment: “I’m not just a vicar’s daughter, I’m a member of the National Trust as well.”\n\nIn December, she told the House of Commons: “Our Christian heritage is something we can all be proud of.” In a newspaper interview the same month, she said: “I am a practising member of the Church of England and so forth – that lies behind what I do.” But she stressed that religious tolerance and freedom of speech in the UK need to be safeguarded, adding: “We must continue to ensure that people feel able to speak about their faith, and that absolutely includes their faith in Christ.”\n\nIn his own Easter message, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: “We hear painful stories every day, of homelessness, poverty or crisis in our health service – or across the world, of the devastating consequences of war and conflict … It would be easy to retreat into our private lives because the challenges seem overwhelming, or allow ourselves to be divided and blame others. But we need to respond to these problems head on, through action and support for social justice, peace and reconciliation. Those principles are at the heart of Christianity. And Christians throughout the world will this weekend be remembering Jesus’s example of love and sacrifice, and the Easter message of redemption and peace.”\n\nKeith Porteous-Wood of the National Secular Society said: “There can be few countries, if any, where religious expression is as free as in Britain. Perhaps Mrs May’s anxiety about Christians feeling constrained in speaking out is frustration that, in our multi-religious and less religious society, such messages increasingly fall on deaf ears.”\n\nNick Spencer, author of The Mighty and the Almighty: How Political Leaders Do God, said May’s message appeared to be “motivated by a fear of division”. Linda Woodhead, professor of sociology of religion at Lancaster University, said May’s message was one of “civic religion, rather than orthodox Christian faith”.",

Deres sønn «Morten» er elleve år og begavet.\n\n«Morten» kunne lese da han var fire år og lærte å skrive da han var fem. Han regnet store tall før han startet på barneskolen, og så frem til en skolehverdag fylt med læreglede. Men møtet med grunnskolen ble ikke som forventet. Han fikk en lærer som ikke skrøt av hans evner og lærelyst - tvert imot.\n\nDen kvinnelige læreren var opptatt av at «Morten» skulle gjøre nøyaktig det samme som sine klassekamerater.

  "latent_2604": "Chev Wilkinson/Getty Images\n\nRecently, scientists in Germany gathered several groups of men and women to look at their cells’ life spans. Some of them were young and sedentary, others middle-aged and sedentary. Two other groups were, to put it mildly, active. The first of these consisted of professional runners in their 20s, most of them on the national track-and-field team, training about 45 miles per week. The last were serious, middle-aged longtime runners, with an average age of 51 and a typical training regimen of 50 miles per week, putting those young 45-mile-per-week sluggards to shame.\n\nFrom the first, the scientists noted one aspect of their older runners. It ‘‘was striking,’’ recalls Dr. Christian Werner, an internal-medicine resident at Saarland University Clinic in Homburg, ‘‘to see in our study that many of the middle-aged athletes looked much younger than sedentary control subjects of the same age.’’\n\nEven more striking was what was going on beneath those deceptively youthful surfaces. When the scientists examined white blood cells from each of their subjects, they found that the cells in both the active and slothful young adults had similar-size telomeres. Telomeres are tiny caps on the end of DNA strands — the discovery of their function won several scientists the 2009 Nobel Prize in medicine. When cells divide and replicate these long strands of DNA, the telomere cap is snipped, a process that is believed to protect the rest of the DNA but leaves an increasingly abbreviated telomere. Eventually, if a cell’s telomeres become too short, the cell ‘‘either dies or enters a kind of suspended state,’’ says Stephen Roth, an associate professor of kinesiology at the University of Maryland who is studying exercise and telomeres. Most researchers now accept telomere length as a reliable marker of cell age. In general, the shorter the telomere, the functionally older and more tired the cell.\n\nIt’s not surprising, then, that the young subjects’ telomeres were about the same length, whether they ran exhaustively or sat around all day. None of them had been on earth long enough for multiple cell divisions to have snipped away at their telomeres. The young never appreciate robust telomere length until they’ve lost it.\n\nWhen the researchers measured telomeres in the middle-aged subjects, however, the situation was quite different. The sedentary older subjects had telomeres that were on average 40 percent shorter than in the sedentary young subjects, suggesting that the older subjects’ cells were, like them, aging. The runners, on the other hand, had remarkably youthful telomeres, a bit shorter than those in the young runners, but only by about 10 percent. In general, telomere loss was reduced by approximately 75 percent in the aging runners. Or, to put it more succinctly, exercise, Dr. Werner says, ‘‘at the molecular level has an anti-aging effect.’’\n\nThere are plenty of reasons to exercise — in this column, I’ve pointed out more than a few — but the effect that regular activity may have on cellular aging could turn out to be the most profound. ‘‘It’s pretty exciting stuff,’’ says Thomas LaRocca, a Ph.D. candidate in the department of integrative physiology at the University of Colorado in Boulder, who has just completed a new study echoing Werner’s findings. In Mr. LaRocca’s work, people were tested both for their V02max — or maximum aerobic capacity, a widely accepted measure of physical fitness — and their white blood cells’ telomere length. In subjects 55 to 72, a higher V02max correlated closely with longer telomeres. The fitter a person was in middle age or onward, the younger their cells.\n\nThere are countless unanswered questions about how and why activity affects the DNA. For instance, Dr. Werner found that his older runners had more activity in their telomerase, a cellular enzyme thought to aid in lengthening and protecting telomeres. Exercise may be affecting telomerase activity and not telomeres directly. In addition, Stephen Roth has been measuring telomeres and telomerase activity in a wide variety of tissues in mice and has found, he says, the protective effects from exercise only in some tissues.\n\nAnother question is whether we must run 50 miles a week to benefit. The answer ‘‘can only be speculative at the moment,’’ Dr. Werner says, although since he jogs much less than that, he probably joins the rest of us in hoping not. Given his and his colleagues’ data, ‘‘one could speculate,’’ he concludes, ‘‘that any form of intense exercise that is regularly performed over a long period of time’’ will improve ‘‘telomere biology,’’ meaning that with enough activity, each of us could outpace the passing years.\n\nAn earlier version of this article stated incorrectly that the Saarland University Clinic is located in Hamburg.",

  "latent_2847": "WASHINGTON, D.C.  Imran Awan, an information technology staffer for former Democratic National Committee Chair and current U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Shultz (D-Fla.) was arrested late last Monday at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia while attempting to board a flight to Qatar.Law enforcement authorities say they had been investigating Awan for close to six months for deliberately overbilling the federal government for IT hardware such as computers, iPads and routers, when the 37-year-old attempted to flee the country to his native born country of Pakistan.On July 25, Awan pleaded not guilt on one count of bank fraud for “knowingly engaging in a scheme to defraud the Wright Patman Congressional Federal Credit Union” on a home loan. The criminal complaint and affidavit revealed that Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, also transferred hundreds of thousands of dollars to Pakistan.Alvi left the country with their three children on March 5 on a similar flight to Doha, Qatar, on her way to Lahore, Pakistan. The FBI and U.S. Capitol Police approached Alvi, who was carrying “numerous pieces of luggage” and $12,400 in U.S. cash, and later learned that the children were abruptly taken out of school without notifying the Fairfax County Public School System.Law enforcement says that Alvi has a return flight booked for September, but have reason to believe she will not return to the U.S. Awan, who was arrested before he could board his July 24 flight, had purchased a return ticket for January 2018.FBI Special Agent Brandon Merriman, who drafted the criminal complaint against Awan, said his investigation included both physical surveillance and interviews.Christopher Gowen, Imran Awan’s lawyer and longtime ally of former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, described Awan’s arrest as “a right-wing media-driven prosecution by a United States Attorney’s Office that wants to prosecute people for working while Muslim.”Gowen told Fox News that federal authorities have no evidence of misconduct by Awan relating to his IT duties.The day of Awan’s court hearing, Wasserman Schultz announced that she had terminated him.”Mr. Awan previously served as a part-time employee but his services have been terminated,” spokesman David Damron said in a statement. “No charges, evidence or findings from the investigation have been formally shared with our office, so we cannot comment on them,”The Florida Democrat had been aware of the investigation into Awan and Alvi for several months but kept him employed at the U.S. House of Representatives.In a strange encounter during a House Appropriations subcommittee hearing on May 18 that was examining the Capitol Police budget, Wasserman Shultz grilled Chief Matthew Verderosa about not returning a laptop belonging to her office.When Verderosa said that the laptop was an important part of a “criminal investigation” and could not be returned at that time, Wasserman appeared agitated and put pressure on the Capitol Police chief.”Under my understanding, the Capitol Police are not allowed to confiscate members’ equipment when the member is not under investigation  it is their equipment and it is supposed to be returned,” she said.”Well, I think there are extenuating circumstances in this case,” Verderosa told the congresswoman.”I think you’re violating the rules when you conduct your business that way and you should expect that there will be consequences,” Wasserman Schultz said.RNC Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel called the case a “huge national security issue.””He had access to Debbie Wasserman Schultz’s computer, he had her password, he had access to all her files, everything having to do with Congress  as well as, potentially, all of her DNC files, and guess what? She’s not cooperating,” McDaniel told a D.C. radio program the week of Awan’s arrest. “She’s obstructing every chance she can.”Awan is scheduled to be back in court on Aug. 21.\n\nRelated",

  "latent_2908": "BEIRUT (Reuters) - Air strikes hit two hospitals in rebel-held territory west of the embattled Syrian city of Aleppo on Monday, and a number of patients and medics were wounded, a monitor and doctor said.\n\nWestern countries and human rights activists have accused the air forces of the Damascus government and its Russian ally of repeatedly targeting hospitals, bread lines and other civilian infrastructure in territory controlled by the rebels.\n\nBoth Moscow and Damascus have denied doing so and say their air campaign is directed against military targets belonging to the rebels, who they describe as terrorists.\n\nThe Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a Britain-based war monitor, said warplanes pounded the town of Atareb overnight and into Monday, knocking the hospital out of service.\n\nThere were five air strikes on the hospital that destroyed operations and waiting rooms and damaged ambulances in what was the fourth aerial attack on the facility this year, according to the Observatory.\n\nIt was the sole hospital in Atareb and at least 60,000 people live in the town and surrounding area, it said.\n\nThe strikes injured many patients, said Osama Abo Ezz, a general surgeon and Aleppo coordinator for the Syrian American Medical Society (SAMS), which partially supports the hospital. “They were at the hospital for check-ups,” he said.\n\nWarplanes also hit and disabled Ansar hospital in Kafrnaha, 15 km (10 miles) from Atareb, marking the third air strike on that facility in the past month, the Observatory said.\n\nThere were no initial reports of deaths in either attack.\n\nAdham Sahloul, a SAMS advocacy officer, said there have been seven attacks on hospitals in rural districts of Aleppo and Idlib provinces since Friday.\n\nWhile Syrian and Russian authorities have denied any deliberate targeting of hospitals, Moscow’s deputy foreign minister accused rebels recently of using civilians and “so-called hospitals” as human shields and setting up medical facilities in cities without correctly marking them.\n\nRebels, supported by Turkey, the U.S. and Gulf monarchies, are fighting to oust President Bashar al-Assad, whose military, backed by Russia’s air force, has used jet and helicopter strikes extensively in the five-and-a-half-year war.\n\nOn Monday, insurgents clashed in a town near the Turkish border as inter-rebel tensions spilled over, playing to Assad’s advantage with the government tightening its grip on the rebel-held eastern half of Aleppo.\n\nThe conflict has killed hundreds of thousands of people, left half the country’s pre-war population homeless, dragged in global powers and given space to Islamist militant groups to consolidate their organizations and plan attacks abroad.",

  "latent_3087": "JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. (AP) — Despite publicly disavowing candidate Todd Akin after his \"legitimate rape\" remark, the National Republican Senatorial Committee quietly sent $760,000 to Missouri in a last-ditch attempt to aid Akin's unsuccessful bid to unseat Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill.\n\nThe long-suspected money shuffling, which had never previously been confirmed, is detailed in a postelection campaign finance report filed this week by the Missouri Republican State Committee. A spokesman for Senate Democrats asserted Friday that the funding was \"underhanded and dishonest.\"\n\nThe Republican senatorial committee had said it would no longer support Akin after the suburban St. Louis congressman remarked in August that women's bodies have ways of avoiding pregnancy in what he called \"legitimate rape.\" Although Akin apologized, he refused calls from leading Republicans to drop out of the race so that the Missouri GOP could field a replacement candidate.\n\nBy remaining in the race, Akin left the Republican senatorial committee with an awkward decision: Reverse course and support Akin, regardless of how it might affect the party's image, or stand pat and further jeopardize Akin's chances of winning and the GOP's chances of taking control of the Senate. It split the difference — publicly standing by its disavowal of Akin while privately funneling money to his campaign.\n\nA federal campaign finance report shows that the Missouri Republican State Committee received $760,000 from the NRSC in two payments made Nov. 1 and Nov. 2. About the same time, the state Republican committee made two payments totaling $756,000 for TV ads supporting Akin, according to the finance report.\n\nNeither the NRSC nor the state GOP committee would confirm the source of the money at the time of the ad buys. Spokesmen for the two Republican groups did not immediately return messages Friday.\n\nAkin's former campaign spokesman, Ryan Hite, said Friday that he always had assumed the money came from the NRSC.\n\n\"No one actually ever officially told us,\" Hite said. But \"everything tended to be implied of where the state committee got this money. ... It was very quiet.\"\n\nDemocrats denounced the secretive payments as deceptive.\n\n\"It was underhanded and dishonest that they would purposely mislead the public about their actions,\" said Matt Canter, a spokesman for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.\n\nMcCaskill campaign manager Adrianne Marsh said it was \"insulting to Missourians that the NRSC thought they could get away\" with quietly directing money to Akin.\n\n\"I don't know what's worse, the hypocrisy or the evasion,\" Marsh said.\n\nThe money was too little, too late to help Akin. McCaskill solidly defeated him with 55 percent of the vote to his 39 percent — the largest victory margin for a Missouri Senate race in 18 years.\n\nAkin had expressed frustration during the campaign that the Republican senatorial group had not publicly supported him as part of their drive to gain the four seats necessary to take control of the Senate away from Democrats. As it turned out, Democrats ended up gaining two additional Senate seats.\n\n\"I don't know if anyone could pinpoint exactly what won or lost the election for McCaskill or for Akin, but I'm sure that having those expenditures earlier on would definitely have given us a boost — I have no doubt about that,\" Hite said.\n\nOne organization that did publicly come to Akin's defense was the Kansas City-based Now or Never Political Action Committee, which launched a $1 million ad buy in the closing days of the campaign. At the time, the source of that money also was unclear.\n\nA finance report filed this week by the organization shows it received $800,000 from wealthy Missouri businessman Rex Sinquefield on Nov. 1. That came one day after the organization reported making a similarly sized payment for ads supporting Akin. The committee also had other contributors, and made an additional $200,000 ad buy for Akin on Nov. 2.\n\nSince his loss, Akin has sent emails to supporters seeking money to pay off campaign debt. But it's not clear how much he still owes, because his campaign declined to release a summary of its postelection finance report.\n\nMcCaskill's campaign provided a summary Friday showing she spent nearly $19.3 million on her re-election and has a debt of $238,000. Marsh said the campaign has outstanding invoices for ad production.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer David Espo contributed to this report from Washington, D.C.\n\n___\n\nDavid A.

Their selection will come at No. 56 courtesy of the Memphis Grizzlies from the Austin Rivers deal.\n\nWhile not as sweet as owning a first-rounder, the Pellies should still be content with having any say at all on June 25 (their first-round selection belongs to the Houston Rockets from the Omer Asik trade). After its best season in four years, New Orleans must strengthen the bench that held this team back at times during the 2014-15 season.\n\nWith Asik and Alexis Ajinca both headed for free agency, opting to draft some size might not be a bad idea. But a point guard or a three-and-D wing would deepen this roster more.\n\nLuckily for the Pelicans, there is talent to be had even in the last sector of the draft. Luis Scola (55th), Monta Ellis (40th), Michael Redd (43rd), Manu Ginobili (57th), Paul Millsap (47th) and Isaiah Thomas (60th) were all taken late. So there’s definitely hope.\n\nBut before the ‘Cans worry about drafting a player like that, they should cross their fingers that this rookie at least makes the team next fall.\n\nDarius Miller (46th), Josh Harrellson (45th) and Adam Haluska (43rd) were NOLA's last three second-round picks. None of them are still with the team.\n\nLet’s take a look at a pair of realistically attainable prospects who could fit with the Pelicans.\n\nJoseph Young, Oregon G\n\nEthan Miller/Getty Images\n\nDraft Express has Oregon’s sensational guard Joseph Young falling to 57th, one spot after New Orleans is projected to pick.\n\nIf the Pac-12 Player of the Year is available, general manager Dell Demps needs to snatch him right up. Young is a combo guard capable of playing either the 1 or 2, and that versatility would come in handy for the Pels.\n\nEric Gordon is the team’s only reliable shooting guard, and Jrue Holiday’s battle with injuries has created an opening for a player like Young, who could play anywhere in the backcourt.\n\nLayne Murdoch/Getty Images\n\nThe 22-year-old scoring machine has drawn some jaw-dropping comparisons and deserves a chance at the pro level. Here’s what a Pac-12 coach told NBA.com’s David Aldridge:\n\nThe best guy in our league is Joe Young. He's a poor man's Steph Curry. People forget, Steph came out of college, and he couldn't really dribble like that. Steph became that player. He didn't walk in the door that way. Young can shoot the ball, put it on the floor good enough. People are going to say he can't put the ball on the floor and he's not really a point guard. Now he's player of the year ... He has the cockiness. He can get to the rim. Got some toughness about him. That dude can play, man. That team was supposed to finish eighth in the conference and they finished second.\n\nYoung carried the Ducks during his senior year, averaging 20.7 points on 44.8 percent shooting (35.7 3PT), 4.4 rebounds, 3.8 assists and 1.1 steals. Against Wisconsin in the round of 32, The senior went for a game-high 30 points while shooting 12-of-25 from the field. Once this kid got going, he was nearly unstoppable—in college, at least.\n\n\"Obviously, he's not going to do that at the NBA level,\" an NBA GM told Aldridge. \"But he does have the athleticism, the quickness to get to the basket, which could be intriguing.\"\n\nKyle Terada-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe 6’2’, 178-pound Young won’t dominate anyone with his strength, but he’s a shifty, sweet-shooting scorer capable of putting up points in a hurry.\n\n(Side note: His father, Michael, played for Houston's legendary Phi Slama Jama teams back in the 80s. Big-time basketball is in his blood.)\n\nNew Orleans’ bench averaged just 31.9 points per game this season, 18th-most in the league according to Hoop Stats. It’s a unit that could definitely use an offensive weapon like Young.\n\nRakeem Christmas, Syracuse F/C\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nLet’s say Young gets snagged before the Pels pick, and the team doesn’t love any of the guards left on the board. What then?\n\nGo big.\n\nThere’s a possibility that some size-deficient team overspends on Ajinca and/or Asik this summer, leaving the Pels with just Anthony Davis and Ryan Anderson inside.\n\nSyracuse’s Rakeem Christmas is someone to consider late in Round 2. While undersized at 6’9”, the big fella proved to be quite a force for Jim Boeheim this season, filling up the stat sheet with 17.5 points (55.2 percent), 10.6 rebounds and 2.9 swats per outing.\n\nBrett Carlsen/Getty Images\n\nThe Pels need a player capable of producing offensively but also making a difference on the other end. According to Basketball-Reference.com, the Pelicans had the No. 22 defense in the league, but the shot-swatting Christmas would help in that regard.\n\nChristmas weighs in at a strong 250 pounds and could hold his own against opposing power forwards. Some centers might prove to be a problem, but Davis can stick with anyone, big or small, in this league.\n\nAD, known for his freakishly long arms, measured a 7’5.5” wingspan at the NBA Draft Combine. At the LeBron James Camp, Christmas was determined to own a 7’3” wingspan, which is pretty substantial.\n\nDerick E. Hingle-USA TODAY Sports\n\nBack in February, Bleacher Report draft expert Jonathan Wasserman called the senior “a powerful yet clever back-to-the-basket scorer, with the ability to separate and turn over either shoulder.”\n\nHis bruising post-up style would be a nice contrast to Davis’ uber-athletic aerial attack and smooth outside game.\n\nChristmas’ lack of height for his position is a definite turnoff, but everything else about the 23-year-old would be valuable for the Pelicans. Flanked next to AD as an interchangeable 4/5 combo, Christmas could give New Orleans a frontcourt no opponent wants to see.\n\nAll stats are accurate courtesy of Basketball-Reference.com unless otherwise noted.",

The only obstacle left is the approval of three college administrators, two lawyers, a dentist, an engineer, a geographer, a political scientist, an economist, a priest and an architect.\n\nVirginia Tech president Charles W. Steger leads the BCS Presidential Oversight Committee. AP Photo/Jacquelyn Martin\n\nThat is not the membership of the Ann Arbor Rotary Club, even if it sounds like it. That is the membership of the BCS Presidential Oversight Committee, and doesn't it just warm your heart cockles to know that the sport is in their hands?\n\nThe committee, led by Virginia Tech president Charles W. Steger -- he's the architect -- will meet in Washington, D.C., Tuesday to consider the recommendation by the FBS commissioners and Notre Dame athletic director Jack Swarbrick to conclude the FBS college football season with a four-team seeded playoff.\n\nWhile the committee is not supposed to be a rubber stamp, the possibility that the decision will not be ratified hasn't come up in conversation, polite or otherwise. That could be because the presidents have been involved in the decision since SEC commissioner Mike Slive brought it up for debate last January.\n\nOr it could be because the committee will serve as a rubber stamp.\n\nThe committee has the last say as a reminder to one and all that this is college football. University presidents reasserted control of their athletic departments two decades ago, when the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics goaded, cajoled and otherwise humiliated the NCAA membership into making sure that presidents ran the show.\n\n\"If the university is not itself a model of ethical behavior,\" the commission wrote in its 1991 report, \"why should we expect such behavior from students or from the larger society?\"\n\nThe commission also wrote in clear language that \"intercollegiate athletics must reflect the values of the university. Where the realities of intercollegiate competition challenge those values, the university must prevail.\"\n\nPutting the presidents in charge of college football is a good idea in theory, as is flossing. In reality, the future of college football rests in the hands of 12 men who may or may not believe that a spread offense is putting mayonnaise on a bagel.\n\nThe commissioners didn't assemble these presidents because of their collective football expertise. Each man represents one of the 11 FBS conferences, plus the Rev. John I. Jenkins of Notre Dame (yeah, he's the priest).\n\nUniversity presidents are facilitators. Anyone who can get a faculty to row in the same direction can practice the art of diplomacy. But the commissioners have assembled the consensus and brought it to the presidents, bow already tied around it. What is there for the committee to oversee?\n\nIt may come as some solace to learn that university presidents are asked every single day to make important decisions on matters outside of their disciplines. When the University of Idaho announced a capital campaign in April that will fund a $50 million Integrated Research Innovations Center, nobody complained that president M. Duane Nellis is a geographer by trade.\n\nOn the other hand, that's a computer lab. This is the national by-god championship, and the committee had better make the right decision.\n\nCould Harvey Perlman throw a wrench into the mix? The Nebraska president has pushed for a plus-one model. AP Photo/Nati Harnik\n\nIt is assumed that the best decision for the committee to make is to ratify the consensus of the commissioners, to provide college football the playoff it needs. However, as recently as 2009, the Knight Commission co-chairs, Maryland chancellor William E. Kirwan and SMU president R. Gerald Turner, wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post in which they warned that a playoff would not solve the ills of the football arms race.\n\n(And if you don't think this playoff is up for a vote at least in part because of the money it will bring, God bless.)\n\nKirwan and Turner also cited a survey of FBS university presidents released by the Knight Commission earlier that year in which the presidents said \"they have limited power to make substantive change acting alone.\"\n\nSo, we have to ask: Could the BCS Presidential Oversight Committee be made up of 12 Angry Men? What if the committee votes no?\n\nOne option would be to keep the BCS, which few are advocating. Another option would be the plus-one, which compared to the playoff is pretty much a distinction without a difference. Except that Nebraska president Harvey Perlman -- he's one of the lawyers on the committee -- has pushed hard for it.\n\nThe fact is, if the committee votes no on a playoff, it will be the biggest upset since Boise State beat Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta Bowl. The presidents will meet. They will discuss. And they will vote in the playoff. Whether this is an abrogation of presidential oversight or the reality of a side of higher education in which coaches are paid $5 million per year depends on the eye of the beholder.\n\nSo a priest, an architect and a dentist walk into a meeting",

  "latent_3665": "Intel may have made a big splash this week announcing it's going to focus on the mobile market, but its rival in the space says the chip maker has an uphill climb ahead of it.\n\nJames Bruce, lead mobile strategist for ARM Limited, said in an interview that this isn't the first time Intel has said it's setting its sights on the mobile market. So for now, he's not too worried about Intel's plans.\n\n\"I think the mobile market is incredibly exciting,\" said Bruce. \"I'd be more surprised if companies did not want to play in the mobile market.... If you look historically, they've been talking about the mobile market for quite some time now. There's been a lot of talk, but I'm waiting very much to see a device ship.\"\n\nDuring Intel's financial analyst meeting on Monday, CEO Paul Otellini said he is refocusing the company, moving its \"center\" from PC processors to chips for the burgeoning mobile market. That means Intel will be trying to get a footing in a lucrative market that encompasses smartphones, tablets and netbooks.\n\nIt also means Intel is putting its considerable might and financial muscle to battle ARM chips, which dominate the mobile market.\n\nActually, dominate might be an understatement.\n\nAccording to Bruce, ARM chips make up a whopping 95% of the cell phone and smartphone market. If you add tablets like Apple's iPad 2 into the mix, ARM would still hold about the same percentage of the mobile market, he added.\n\n\"At the moment, there are no smartphones shipping with the Atom processor,\" said Bruce. \"Looking at handsets today, [Intel] is not a competitor because there's nothing shipping with it.\"\n\nIntel would like to change that, though. And analysts have said over the past several days that they suspect Intel will be unveiling new mobile chips within a year to 18 months.\n\nBruce said that what matters is seeing something go into production. \"I'm sure there are going to be handsets shipping at some point in the future with Atom processors,\" he acknowledged. \"To be honest, from our perspective, proof is really very much in production.\"",

Lindsey Graham is no fan of Ted Cruz, but he'd prefer him over Donald Trump as the Republican Party's nominee. | AP Photo Graham dislikes Cruz less than he dislikes Trump\n\nSouth Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham promised to “try not to cuss” Sunday morning on NBC’s “Meet the Press,” but the outspoken Republican held his tongue about little else on his party’s future.\n\nAsked by panelist David Brooks of The New York Times to outline Ted Cruz’s accomplishments in the Senate, Graham answered that the Texas senator “basically made most people in the party believe that the reason we don’t repeal Obamacare is because of me and Mitch McConnell.”\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nStill, forced to choose between Cruz and GOP front-runner Donald Trump, Graham was clear that the Texas firebrand is his pick, if only because Cruz checks the “conservative” box.\n\n“Ted is a conservative. He’s more ideological than I am, but he is a Republican conservative and Donald Trump is not,” Graham said. “If I had to support Ted Cruz over Donald Trump, I would because I think he is a Republican conservative, and he might could beat Hillary Clinton.”\n\nPrompted to reflect on his party’s chances in November, Graham painted a bleak picture.\n\n“Some hope with Ted, no hope with The Donald,” said Graham, a Jeb Bush endorser who now backs Sen. Marco Rubio. “We’re in a demographic death spiral. What did we learn in 2012? Hispanics don’t like our message on immigration of self-deportation. I don’t think they’re going to like forced-deportation better. At the end of the day, Donald Trump has taken every problem we’ve had with Hispanics and young women and made them worse.\n\n“If Donald Trump’s the nominee, the Republican Party will get killed, will get creamed; we’ll lose, we’ll deserve it,” Graham said.",
  "latent_3746": "When the Family Day holiday was introduced by the Christy Clark government, British Columbians were happy. A statutory holiday in February? Yes, please.\n\nBut five years on, the bloom is off the rose. Family Day would be a lot better, the majority in the province believe, if it landed not on the second Monday of the month, but the third.\n\nA new poll conducted by Insights West found that 71 per cent of British Columbians support observing the holiday in the third week, with 48 per cent strongly supporting the change, and 23 per cent somewhat supporting it.\n\nWhy does it matter? Isn’t any day off a good day? Certainly, but it would be better, B.C. residents say, if it lined up with the rest of Canada’s February statutory holidays. Seven other Canadian provinces — Alberta, Manitoba, Ontario, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island and Saskatchewan — observe their holiday on the third Monday of February. B.C.’s Week 2 holiday is an outlier. People just want to fit in.\n\n“Our province has celebrated five Family Day holidays after years of not having a day of rest in February,” said Mario Canseco, vice-president of public affairs at Insights West. “At this point, most British Columbians think it makes sense to have the holiday on the same day as the seven other provinces that enjoy a day off in February.”\n\nSupport for the change is high across all demographic groups, and it climbs with age. Among those 18-34, 60 per cent support the change. Support rises to 70 per cent in the 35-54 demographic. And for those 55 and up, support sits at 80 per cent, according to the poll. As the older demographics are likeliest to have children, it would appear those looking to actually spend Family Day with their family are the most perturbed by its current calendar placement.\n\nYoung people seem to care the least, and their ambivalence is evident in the data: 26 per cent of 18-to-34-year-olds only “somewhat” support the change, the highest percentage among the three age groups. (Then again, it’s hard to get millennials to commit to much of anything.)\n\nA petition on Change.org calling to move the holiday has accrued more than 22,000 signatures since it was launched in 2015. “Many B.C. families find themselves working who are federal employees, business owners, or who conduct business across Canada and North America,” it argued. “This means the true spirit of Family Day is lost.”\n\nIn December of 2015, the B.C. government responded to a formal request from Anita Huberman, CEO of the Surrey Board of Trade, to change the date, explaining that staggering the holiday was done to promote B.C. tourism — after all, who will staff the ski hills and resort towns for out-of-province visitors if everyone in the province has the day off too? Not to mention two consecutive holiday Mondays means an increased bottom line for skiing and tourism in the B.C. Interior, which is a short drive for Metro Vancouverites and Albertans alike.\n\nBut there has been a regime change since then, and the issue is back on the table. Premier John Horgan indicated in October that his government was considering a date change for the holiday.\n\n“We’ve been hearing from British Columbians, particularly business people, that don’t want to see them being out of sync with the rest of the country when it comes to celebrating a holiday in February,” Horgan told News 1130. “I think everyone supports the idea of a day off in February — I certainly do — but why wouldn’t we be in line with other provinces so that we can have commerce continue, so that you can have a family holiday and not miss out because you have to work on the day that everyone else is off?” said Horgan.\n\nHorgan added that this change, which only 13 per cent of British Columbians oppose, according to the poll, is possible for 2018.\n\nThe results of the poll are based on an online study conducted from Oct. 31 to Nov. 2 of this year; 803 B.C. adults, statistically weighted according to Canadian census figures for age, gender and region, were surveyed. The margin of error is +/- 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20.\n\nhmooney@postmedia.com\n\nCLICK HERE to report a typo.\n\nIs there more to this story?

  "latent_3796": "The underlying premise of any organization is to create value. Historically, firms have done so through engineering ever greater efficiency. By honing internal processes, optimizing the supply chain and reducing product inventories, managers could improve margins and create a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nThat’s created a bias for simple, linear thinking. Adding extra variables to any process is bound to increase errors and diminish quality, so generations of managers have been trained to wring complexity out of the system in order to create streamlined operations. “Keep it simple, stupid” has become a common corporate mantra.\n\nYet in today’s networked marketplace, agility trumps efficiency. Innovation has become the primary driver of value, which means that you need to constantly identify and incorporate new ideas, many of which do not fit into neat little boxes. That’s why managing complexity is emerging as a core business skill. You can’t create truly new value without it.\n\nComplexity Confusion\n\nThe first step to managing complexity effectively is to understand that there are different types of complexity. The first, the complexity of an entity, almost always should be reduced, if possible, for the same reasons that you’re high school math teacher insisted that you factor down your answers. Simplifying entities makes them easier to understand.\n\nThe second type of complexity, that of a system, is unavoidable and often leads to nonlinearity, such as accelerating returns. This facet of complexity can be troublesome because it makes it easy to dismiss disruptive events. Yet these often advance at an exponential rate, as seems to be happening now in energy.\n\nThe final type, emergent complexity is what happens when chaotic interactions between entities combine to create something completely new and unexpected, such as in a Mandelbrot set, the swarming patterns of birds or the pattern of activity in an organization. We can—and often do—minimize this type of complexity, but we shouldn’t.\n\nWhile many companies work hard to keep things linear and simple, innovative firms work hard to embrace emergence. Bell Labs, for example, designed its workspace to encourage random interactions. Steve Jobs did so as well. Google encourages its employees to work on their own projects. It is this type of complexity that we want more of, not less.\n\nCrystallizing Imagination\n\nIn Why Information Grows, MIT’s Cesar Hidalgo argues that emergent complexity is a primary driver of value. The reason is that products and services are far more than the result of a particular set of inputs and processes, but derive their value by “crystallizing imagination.”\n\nTo see what he means, take a company like Apple. Its first hit product, the Apple II, crystallized the imagination of not only Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, but also that of the other members of the Homebrew Computer Club, whose meetings they attended. Later, the imagination crystallized at Xerox PARC helped lead to a second hit product, the Macintosh.\n\nAt the same time, while the linear thinking at Xerox led to a highly efficient corporate machine that made the world’s best copiers, it’s failure to embrace the ideas coming out of PARC led it to miss important opportunities. Sure, it seems foolish now, but at the time, Xerox executives were following a time tested, simple formula for success—optimizing processes for predictability, rather than for emergence.\n\nInnovation is never a single event, but tends to follow a long and twisted path. It’s what emerges when complex networks of ideas combine to solve an important problem. That, in essence, is how value is created.\n\nA Failure In Complexity Management\n\nThe need to embrace complexity is fairly obvious in high tech industries, but Zeynep Ton argues in The Good Jobs Strategy that the same principle also holds true in industries that we wouldn’t ordinarily associate with creativity and innovation. According to her research, the same type of linear thinking that doomed Xerox also impairs performance in high volume, low cost retail.\n\nConventional thinking in the industry says that to protect margins, labor costs must be minimized. So it is common for retailers to pay low wages, invest little in training and reduce the number of people working in the store at any given time to the absolute minimum. Yet Ton, an operations expert, found exactly the opposite.\n\nThe problem is that low paid, poorly trained and overworked staff tend not to contribute many ideas that can improve a business and when you set up an organization to only crystallize the imagination of those at the top, you are limiting your capacity to create new value.\n\nFor example, when the recession hit in 2008, Mercadona, Spain’s leading discount retailer, needed to cut costs. But rather than cutting wages or reducing staff, they asked their employees to contribute ideas. The result was that they managed to reduce prices by 10% and increased their market share from 15% to 20% from 2008 to 2012.\n\nInterestingly, Ton also points out that that many successful retailers are reducing complexity in some places so that they can embrace it in others. Trader Joe’s, for instance, limits the numbers of products it carries, partly because that allows its employees to become experts on the products the store does carry and manage complex customer interactions.\n\nCompeting In A Networked Economy\n\nClearly, the marketplace has been transformed. Earlier generations of managers were trained to engineer efficiency by optimizing value chains. Processes needed to be standardized and streamlined so that they could achieve maximum efficiency. That, in a nutshell, is how you built a sustainable competitive advantage.\n\nYet today, as processes become increasingly automated, gains from efficiency are harder to achieve and the ability to collaborate is becoming a key source of competitive advantage. It is no longer the assets that you own and control that will determine what you can achieve, but those you can access.\n\nThese days, we need to access ecosystems through platforms. In other words, value is created at the center of complex networks and the center of any network is always a chaotic place. Apple, for example, cannot simply dictate terms to the developers on its App Store, any more than retailers can bludgeon their workers to come up with creative solutions to problems.\n\nAnd that’s why managers need to embrace complexity. Not because it will make their enterprise more efficient—it won’t—but because that’s what will allow them to create maximum value in an increasingly complex marketplace.",
  "latent_3832": "The four women closest to President Assad were added to the European Union's sanctions list at a meeting of Europe's foreign ministers today.\n\nThe Syrian leader's wife, mother, sister and sister-in-law will be added to the travel ban and asset freeze blacklist as the EU steps pressure on Assad's inner circle and family.\n\nWilliam Hague, the Foreign Secretary said: \"Their behaviour continues to be murdering and totally unacceptable in the eyes of the world.\"\n\nThe 36-year-old former investment banker and the female relatives of regime members will join another eight government officials and two oil firms added to 114 Syrians and 38 organisations subject to freezes on their assets and bank accounts in EU member states.\n\nEU and British officials have faith that the move will add to the \"stranglehold\" on the regime, though it has survived 11 previous rounds of sanctions.\n\nLike others already listed, Mrs Assad is likely to be subject to an EU travel ban, though this would not prevent her travelling to Britain, if she has retained her British citizenship.\n\nBorn and raised in Acton, west London, she married Mr Assad in late 2000, the year he was installed as president following the death of his father, Hafez.\n\nHer role in the president's inner circle has come under increased scrutiny after emails written by Syria's first couple were leaked by opposition activists.\n\nThey showed that as the government offensive that has claimed an estimated 7,000 lives intensified, she shopped online in London and Paris, spending tens of thousands of pounds on jewels, furniture and a Venetian glass vase from Harrods.\n\nShe used an alias to make purchases from Europe and asked a friend to acquire a copy of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II for her two older children. In drawing up previous sanctions, the EU froze \"all funds and economic resources\" belonging to \"persons responsible for the violent repression against the civilian population\" or \"persons and entities associated with them\".\n\nMrs Assad may already have violated sanctions with her online shopping spree that could expose her to prosecution. The regulations prohibit EU citizens from making \"funds or economic resources\" available to anyone named on the list.\n\nBefore the protests against her husband's rule began a year ago, she cultivated the image of a glamorous yet serious-minded woman with strong Western-inspired values who would liberalise the ruling family and the country. A glowing article in Vogue magazine described her as \"a rose in the desert\" and her household as \"wildly democratic\".\n\nThat image crumbled when her husband responded to the anti-government rebellion with extreme violence. She has shown no sign of the inner torment that some who met her beforehand assumed she was going through. Her messages to her husband and her friends are utterly supportive of him and at times display a resolve to see the crisis out.\n\n\"If we are strong together, we will overcome this togethere_SLps I love you,\" she wrote to her husband on Dec 28.\n\nIn her only statement since the crisis broke out, she said: \"The president is the president of Syria, not a faction of Syrians, and the first lady supports him in that role.\" The emails also show that her father, Fawaz Akhras, a cardiologist at London's Cromwell hospital who has a private practice on Harley Street, regularly provided advice to Mr Assad on media and public relations policy.\n\n\"She and her father are accomplices to this crime. They learned nothing from the democracy here in the UK,\" said an opponent of the regime in London who asked to be named as Fawaz. He claimed that Mrs Assad had become a hate figure for many in the expatriate community of which she was once a part.\n\n\"They have stolen Syrian money. She is squandering it here in London,\" he said.",

So much has been written about this show and Jerry's end. It sounds good. People are projecting their sadness and unable to hear the music for what it is. I haven't read anyone comment on just how much the drummers are kicking ass throughout. The jams sound good e.g . SS. Remember, time colors your perception... in the early 80's we thought, crap Jerry's voice is shot, in the 90's we wished he sound as good as the early 80's again and so on.

These days, being 2014 now, it's all about \"space\" from the beginning unto the end. Just for that alone, 5 stars! It's not even about regular music for me, it's SPACE! Lots and lots of space. I tend to eat, drink, live in \"space\" I love space. I am an astronaut, not of this world. And so it's all about space! It's been said that when the boys went to Egypt and played those shows there at the pyramids, it wasn't the best ones they did. Probably true. But then, listen to the \"space\" portions. It all makes sense to me. That's what it was all about. \"Space\" is the place. After 7-9- 1995 there was no more space. I don't know if the \"dead\" even do that stuff at all anymore. I haven't been to a GD or Dead show since 1987.\n\nNow about the actual passing of Jerry a month later, in August 9th I believe. That day, was very strange. When his actual departure happened in the bay area there was a power shortage reported there, around the same time. Very strange indeed. He really must have been a very powerful spirit indeed. Also, I heard the news while rafting on the American River outside of Sacramento. Also appropriate for me being how things happen on the river.

It is ok to leave a negative review, but make it useful. For what it is worth, I am a middle-aged Deadhead, tried and trued. Went to loads of shows, first turned on in 1979 with a copy of Terrapin Station. Want to know the best years? Depends on your mood. Over the past few years, I have been enjoying this website and embracing the spectrum. Sometimes I want to groove, sometimes I want to brood. My last show was in 1990 but I also can feel the emotion in \"So Many Roads.\" If you can't find anything in ANY show from 66-95, you might want to reconsider what you are looking for. Thankfully, the Dead--and this Archive--give us a lot of material to contemplate. No rating from me.

Ofcourse everyone has a preference of what years were peak years for the Dead, just like i have my favorite years, but what he is saying doesnt even make sense.\n\nHe says post-82 dead is no good, but those years dont even match up. Ok... if you are a keith and donna fan, those years were over in 78. (my personal fave year being 77) From 79 to 82 was Brents first few years with the band and do you really think that 1981 Dead with Brent was better than 1989 or 90 dead after Brent had found his place in the band?? Simply a ridiculous statement. 1979-1984 was still dead, but it was a more laid back kinda dead... not nearly as hard hitting as 1985 and beyond. Ofcourse I have my opinions and I feel that anything after 1992 was not really that great because I wasnt a vince fan, but if snydel is going to include brent years as some of the best years, then there is no comparison to the smokin stuff of the late eighties. Also, in 1991 when Bruce was helping out it brought the entire band to a whole new level and it truly was some of the most inspired music I have ever heard the dead play. The proof is all over the archive here.

Jerry decided to play Black Muddy River, and afterwards, Phil (knowing this was the final day of a very turbulent tour, and not wanting to end it on a sad song) Started in on Box of Rain. Box of Rain being the first track of American Beauty. American Beauty being the album that is most often a persons first exposure to the band. I dont know about any of you, but The first Grateful Dead song I ever heard was Box of Rain (Born in 81). The first time I heard it, I listened to it for at least an hour. Therefore I at least find this to be the perfect song to end the trip on. Better than anything else was Garcias first solo in so many roads. I sit here with tears in my eyes as I listen to it now.

(Photo11: Pool, Getty Images)\n\nST. LOUIS — Some witnesses who testified before the grand jury that investigated the shooting of an unarmed teenager clearly lied under oath, according to St. Louis County Prosecutor Bob McCulloch.\n\nIn an interview Friday with radio station KTRS in St. Louis, McCulloch said he had no regrets about letting the grand jury hear from non-credible witnesses.\n\n\"Early on I decided that anyone who claimed to have witnessed anything would be presented to the grand jury,\" said McCulloch, who convened the grand jury in August.\n\n\"Clearly some were not telling the truth,\" he said.\n\nIt was McCulloch's first interview since he announced on Nov. 24 that the grand jury would not indict Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson in the shooting of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man who was unarmed.\n\nMcCulloch made reference to one woman who claimed to have seen the shooting. McCulloch said she \"clearly wasn't present. She recounted a story right out of the newspaper\" that backed up Wilson's version of events, he said.\n\nMcCulloch said he's not planning to pursue charges against witnesses who lied.\n\nThe shooting by a white police officer on Aug. 9 spurred significant unrest, both in August and immediately after the decision not to indict was announced. Twelve Ferguson-area businesses, along with police cars, were burned on Nov. 24, and several other businesses were damaged.\n\nMeanwhile, state Rep. Karla May is calling or a state investigation of McCulloch, saying he \"manipulated\" the grand jury into the decision.\n\nA joint House and Senate committee is already investigating why Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon did not use National Guard troops in Ferguson on Nov. 24. May, a St. Louis Democrat, sent a letter Thursday to committee chairman Sen. Kurt Schaefer, urging that the investigation expand to look at whether McCulloch committed prosecutorial misconduct.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/16BoEyv",
  "latent_4337": "Last year, American Prospect writing fellow Nathalie Baptiste investigated Miami’s meteoric development, questionable federal flood insurance decision-making, and, above all, the epic climate-change denial that set the stage for the impending catastrophe that Hurricane Irma will likely soon unleash on the Magic City. As Harold Wanless, a University of Miami geological sciences professor, warned back then, “Don’t let anybody tell you it’ll be OK.”\n\nThis article originally appeared in the Winter 2016 issue of The American Prospect magazine. Subscribe here.\n\nEven from thousands of feet in the air, it’s obvious that Miami is disturbingly low-lying. Luxury sky-high buildings, bridges, and cranes tower over swampy marshlands and the slowly rising sea. The latest development has resulted in a sprawling metropolis on sinking land. Rising seas combine with porous limestone—which is like Swiss cheese—to allow saltwater to infiltrate under the land during floods, and makes the greater Miami area the most climate-vulnerable place in the United States.\n\nIn Southeast Florida, the sea could rise three feet by 2060, and that doesn’t count temporary storm surges from increasingly intense hurricanes. Seventy-five percent of Florida’s population lives in coastal counties that generate 79 percent of the state’s total annual economy. The infrastructure in these coastal counties had a replacement value of $2 trillion in 2010 and is estimated to increase to $3 trillion by 2030.\n\nOf the 2.6 million people who live in Miami-Dade County, nearly 129,000 of them are living less than three feet above sea level. The county alone has more people living less than four feet above sea level than in any other state except Louisiana. The county’s estimated beachfront property value is more than $14.7 billion—not including infrastructure.\n\nYou might think, therefore, that developers, investors, and homebuyers would be very gun-shy about putting more money into Miami real estate. One good-sized hurricane, or another decade of relentless sea-level rise, and their investment will be washed away. At the very least, values are likely to fall because escalating climate threats will scare off other investors and falling demand will depress property values.\n\nBut you’d be wrong on both counts. Miami is enjoying yet another real-estate boom, one in a long series of boom-and-bust cycles that date back to the first Florida real-estate craze in the 1920s. The previous boom halted briefly after the 2008 collapse, but by 2011 it was on again. As of June 2015, more than 355 new towers have been proposed in South Florida. More than 70 of those will be in the greater downtown Miami area. The popular and wealthy Brickell neighborhood, the heart of the region’s financial sector and a place where one can work and play, is the site of extensive construction. At 500 Brickell Condos, a 46-floor skyscraper completed in 2008, a 754-square-foot apartment with one bedroom and one bathroom rents at $2,050. The same tiny apartment can also be purchased for $300,000.\n\nFlorida International University’s “Eyes on the Rise” web application lets users input addresses and see how much sea-level rise it would take before their homes become part of the sea. At three feet, which could happen by 2060, multiple roads in Brickell are underwater. At six feet, which is projected to occur at the end of the century, the neighborhood is completely submerged.\n\nReal estate is famously cyclical, yet this boom is harder to explain, given the new and very real physical threat. So what explains the seeming irrationality of investors who added a staggering $2.7 billion worth of new construction into Miami real estate in 2014 alone?\n\nA SERIES OF INTERVIEWS AND SOME BACKGROUND research suggest five major reasons. One is the short time horizons and magical thinking of homeowners. All seem to believe in their ability to anticipate the precise moment when the reality of climate disaster sinks in, so to speak, and to sell just before the market collapses.\n\nAP Photo/Lynne Sladky/file In this Friday, May 16, 2014 photo, cranes fill the skyline at the Brickell CityCentre construction site located in the center of the Brickell financial district in downtown Miami.\n\nFor homebuyers, “the risk of sea-level rise 60 years from now is just small potatoes,” says University of Pennsylvania Professor Robert Meyer, who is co-director of Wharton’s Risk Management and Decision Processes Center. “When you buy in real estate,” Meyer explains, “you care about location, amenities, and investment risk. … Sea-level rise is in the distant future. They’re more concerned about what happens if [they] try to sell this week.”\n\nSecondly, developers have even shorter time horizons than homebuyers. Once the property is sold, they are gone and the climate risk is somebody else’s problem. A third reason is the close linkage among Miami’s huge real-estate industry, the local economy, and the behavior of politicians. Bigger floods are surely coming, but few politicians want to rain on the real-estate parade.\n\nTo compound this trend, some Florida politicians are climate-change deniers, a posture reinforced by their affiliation with developers. In 2010, Governor Rick Scott told the Tampa Bay Times that he didn’t believe in climate change. Republican senator and presidential hopeful Marco Rubio says he doesn’t believe that human activity is the main cause of climate change. Politicians also have relatively short time horizons. If the big flood comes in 2030, most will have moved on.\n\nFurther, a huge influx of money from Latin Americans who want to live in Miami, maybe now, maybe later, or want to stash money in the U.S. rather than in shaky economies at home, adds to the overheated demand. And finally, federal flood-insurance policy and disaster-relief outlays create the moral hazard of promoting investment in disaster-prone areas. The federal government shelled out more than $136 billion on disaster relief from fiscal year 2011 to fiscal year 2013. An effort that began in 2012 to increase flood-insurance premiums to align them more accurately with risks was postponed by Congress in 2014 after a huge political backlash.\n\nSo despite increasing risks, property values in prime neighborhoods of Miami are actually rising. The median value of a home in Miami was $286,700 as of November 2015, up from $269,000 the previous year. In neighboring Miami Beach, the median value rose from $373,000 to $406,800 in the same period of time. In popular neighborhoods overlooking the ocean or Biscayne Bay, the median home prices are closer to $1 million and higher.\n\n“Contrary to popular belief, the development industry is one of the most heavily subsidized,” says Florida land-use attorney Richard Grosso. The government builds the roads, the seawalls, and the bridges that protect buildings from the encroaching sea. The federal government also offers subsidized beach-nourishment projects for coastal communities.\n\nBeach erosion is exacerbated by storms and rising sea levels. To combat this problem, nourishment projects take new sand from inlets or the sea floor to widen the beach. Between 1995 and 2002, the government spent $787 million on beach nourishment and has historically subsidized two-thirds of the costs. And the idea that the government will save the day persists in Miami.\n\n“There’s an awful lot of expectation that government won’t let it happen,” explains Grosso, “and that those folks who own prime real estate will be able to influence government to fund the infrastructure and other measures that will protect their investments.”\n\nOne major culprit is the federal government’s National Flood Insurance Program. Created by Congress in 1968 and administered by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, NFIP enables renters, homeowners, and businesses in communities that are participating in the program to purchase discounted flood insurance. Rates are set nationally and depend on when the building was built, and on its level of risk—which has been consistently understated.\n\nAP Photo/Lynne Sladky A cyclist and vehicles negotiate heavily flooded streets as rain falls, Tuesday, September 23, 2014, in Miami Beach, Fla. Certain neighborhoods regularly experience flooding during heavy rains and extreme high tides. New storm water pumps are currently being installed along the bay front in Miami Beach.\n\nBy 2012, the NFIP was $24 billion in debt, which comes as no surprise. The discounted flood insurance created incentives for building in climate-vulnerable areas; repeated payouts after major disasters allow people to continue living and building in these vulnerable low-lying places, like Miami.\n\nFor communities that participate in the National Flood Insurance Program, there’s a voluntary rating program that provides communities with discounts on flood insurance. The Community Rating System runs on a class scheme; each class obtained comes with a 5 percent discount. Miami-Dade County is a Class 5, meaning they’re receiving a 25 percent discount on their flood insurance.\n\nThe NFIP has essentially become the sole provider of flood insurance for most homeowners and small businesses across the nation. Many private insurance companies have canceled flood insurance for areas repeatedly devastated by flooding. In 2007, climate change prompted Allstate to cancel or not renew policies in Florida, Louisiana, and Mississippi because recent hurricanes had decimated all of the profits the company had made in its 75 years.\n\nAnd because the NFIP establishes taxpayer-backed subsidized insurance options, taxpayers are on the hook for major disasters. In response to the NFIP’s mounting debt, Representatives Maxine Waters of California and Judy Biggert of Illinois co-authored the Biggert-Waters Act in 2012.\n\nThe act was an attempt to keep the NFIP soluble and sustainable by eliminating low rates and discounts. According to FEMA, one out of five NFIP policies receive discounts. The Biggert-Waters Act increased insurance rates of subsidized policies for business properties in Special Flood Hazard Areas and for properties that experience severe or repeated flooding. The rate increases set by FEMA ended up being 25 percent each year until they reflect the true risk of flooding.\n\nThe backlash was severe. Members of Congress, including Waters, were outraged at the premium increases that would happen seemingly overnight. She released a statement saying that she was “outraged by the increased costs of flood insurance premiums that have resulted from the Biggert-Waters Act. I certainly did not intend for these types of outrageous premiums to occur for any homeowner.” In a rare form of bipartisanship, Congress passed the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act of 2014, which delays the reforms for four years.\n\nGrosso can sympathize with those experiencing the skyrocketing premium increases. For many middle-class families, flood insurance would become wildly expensive. “I would have liked to see the reaction be more surgical,” he says. Since the NFIP remains frozen, the same old problems remain. A gradual increase, and perhaps increases that focus on the value of the home, could have been more effective. “There is no private-property right to a taxpayer subsidy,” says Grosso. “There is zero legal reason why we should continue to fund our own problem.”\n\nNot surprisingly, Miami-Dade County officials speak kindly of developers, a key industry in the regional economy. “We have to assume they have looked into the same risks,” says James Murley, the county’s chief resilience officer. Since Hurricane Andrew blew through Florida in 1992, he says, codes have changed. “They’re building quality buildings that go 50 feet into the bedrock and can withstand 150-mile-per-hour winds.”\n\nEven if new buildings are built to withstand the effects of climate change, what about the surrounding infrastructure? If you can’t drive to your home or new office building, what’s the point of building climate-ready buildings? “A flood is an event, and it recedes,” says Murley. But the porous limestone underneath Southeast Florida is making it harder for floodwaters to recede—and the intrusion of saltwater is already poisoning Florida’s drinking water.\n\n“We’re looking at implementing a pilot project to identify an area that’s more vulnerable to flooding,” Murley says, “and what we can do to reduce that vulnerability.” The project aims to educate the public about what they can do to protect their homes, such as elevation. “We think we’ll be able to stay on top of these events and protect our people and our property values.” And protecting property values is of the utmost importance. Because the state of Florida doesn’t tax individual income, the state relies heavily on property and sales taxes for funding. In 2010, nearly 43 percent of the state’s revenue came from property taxes.\n\nOthers are highly skeptical. “I’m not sure what a climate-ready building is,” says Harold Wanless, a professor of geological sciences at the University of Miami. “At lower elevations, the only climate-ready building would be a boat.”\n\nJUST HOW SERIOUS IS THE THREAT of sea-level rise for South Florida? Hurricanes have always been a menace to the Florida coastline. In 1926, Miami took a direct hit resulting in 372 deaths and, after adjusting for inflation, $165 billion in damage. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew—which was mainly a wind event—devastated the community of Homestead, just south of Miami. Because of Andrew’s size and the location of its landfall, Miami was spared. Hurricane Wilma slammed into the state in 2005. Since then, one million more people have moved to the state, and Florida is currently in a hurricane drought.\n\nAP Photo/J Pat Carter Mitchell Chester stands outside a new high rise condo complex in Sunny Isles, Fla.,, discussing what may happen in the future with rising sea levels.\n\nScientists don’t believe climate change will make hurricanes more frequent, but they do calculate that the ones that do come ashore will be stronger—and more devastating. Stronger hurricanes coupled with rising seas will also produce dangerous storm surges. Sooner or later, Miami will take a direct hit, the way New York City did with Superstorm Sandy, but with even more lethal effects.\n\nStorms aren’t the only events that flood Miami. High-tide flooding, exacerbated by sea-level rise and heavily developed coastlines, is only expected to get worse in the coming decades. Miami is currently experiencing about six tidal floods annually; by 2030 that number will have skyrocketed to more than 45.\n\nBy 2045, the city can expect an average of 230 minor floods every year, according to the Union of Concerned Scientists. Coastal residents aren’t the only ones who will face flooding, as the waters will be reaching farther inland. Today, people in Florida are buying homes that are likely to face regular flooding within 30 years—the lifetime of a mortgage.\n\nWanless thinks that six feet isn’t even in the ballpark. “That’s probably low,” he says. “The models don’t include the accelerating we’re seeing with ice melt.”\n\nDozens of new condominiums have been built in Miami-Dade County. “I don’t believe they’re designed to handle sea-level rise,” Wanless says. “They’re not designed for storm surges on top of three-to-four-foot sea-level rise, but builders are trying to get away with whatever they can before the bomb drops.”\n\nSome states and locations threatened with rising seas have drawn up resiliency plans, but Wanless doesn’t put much faith in climate-ready infrastructure.\n\n“We’re pouring all our FEMA money into helping people rebuild. We have to get more practical,” he says. “We should be setting aside money for helping people to relocate; that would be one of the more responsible things to do.” But even after storms like Sandy devastate coastal communities and cost the government billions, “the sense of ‘you have to rebuild’ sets in,” Wanless says. “People seem to want to stay where they are. Even if it becomes inconvenient.”\n\n“Don’t let anybody tell you it’ll be okay,” he warns. “Global warming is heating up the ocean and that is something we can’t turn around. … I think people are going to be fleeing from the coast.”\n\nTHE GREAT CLICHE OF THE REAL-ESTATE BUSINESS is that location is everything. That’s especially the case with buildings vulnerable to climate change. A truly green building is structurally sound, energy-efficient, low-cost, and in an area that isn’t vulnerable to sea-level rise and climate-change impacts. So a green building in a bad place is a bad building. In a place like greater Miami, the problem is both too many buildings in the wrong places, and standards that aren’t stringent enough.\n\nThere’s an eco-village being proposed in western Miami-Dade County called Green City. “But it’s in a low-lying area close to the Everglades, where we shouldn’t even be building any new development,” says Richard Grosso.\n\nDevelopers can build climate-ready buildings—or not—but realtors are not currently required to disclose any information about sea-level rise to potential homebuyers. Mitchell Chester is a South Florida–based lawyer who wants to change that. “I’ve heard this one story of a realtor who is refusing to sell if [the potential buyers] don’t understand sea-level rise,” he says. But for the most part, realtors don’t want to lose sales and commission.\n\nOne realtor, Valerie Amor, says she’s atypical when it comes to the real-estate industry. “I am forthcoming and perform a feasibility study before I assist in either buying or selling property,” she says. The reactions she gets from potential homebuyers are not always positive when what they want does not align with reality. Like Chester, she does not know of any regulations that require realtors to disclose climate-change and sea-level impacts. “At this point, it seems to be both a moral and ethical decision.”\n\nSaving South Florida from becoming part of the Atlantic Ocean would cost billions of dollars, and would require strict zoning as well as shifts in federal spending priorities to incentivize prudent construction rather than high-risk development. The real-estate industry doesn’t “want to scream too loudly” about sea-level rise, explains Meyer. “People would stop moving in; property values and the tax base would plummet.” The state would be left with no money for fixes. “If people become afraid and move, you have collapse of the local economy,” he adds, hypothetically, “and the place would be empty before the sea came up.”\n\nThe inevitability of a coastal property crash in South Florida doesn’t seem to deter many people. “It’s all about money,” says William Hardin, the director of Florida International University’s Tibor & Sheila Hollo School of Real Estate. “If somebody is going to buy it, they’re going to build it.”\n\nHardin doesn’t think that potential buyers are unaware of the risks. “Flood insurance shows you the probability of flooding,” he explains. But people still buy homes in known flood zones.\n\nAP Photo/Lynne Sladky This Thursday, July 24, 2014 photo shows construction cranes at the Brickell City Centre project in downtown Miami.\n\nCONTINUING TO SUBSIDIZE FLOOD INSURANCE and incentivizing developers to build in risky and vulnerable areas can eventually lead to a major economic disaster if Florida’s hurricane drought comes to an end. Philip Stoddard is a biology professor at Florida International University and the mayor of South Miami. He is the rare Florida elected official who takes climate change very seriously. He bases his predictions of what could happen to coastal property values on hurricane behavior.\n\nStoddard’s goal is to explain to people what’s happening so that instead of a market crash, there’s a slow slide. “A lot of people ask me, ‘How much time do I have?’” he says. He tells them they don’t have to sell this year, but if it’s their intention to sell, they shouldn’t wait ten more. He also considers the homeowner’s financial situation. “It depends on if your financial well-being is dependent on your home equity. If so, your time horizon should be short—I would suggest you sell.”\n\n“As the reality of seawater rise sinks in, mortgage companies may conclude that 30 years is too long of a time to gamble on,” says Stoddard. “Maybe they’ll only issue 15-year mortgages.” If that were to cause people planning to sell later to change their minds and try to sell now, the result would be a run on the market.\n\nStoddard offers a scenario in which an event leads to an overnight crash. “If you owe $250,000 on your house, but you can only get $50,000, what do you do then?” When properties lose value, underwater homeowners end up with no resources to relocate, essentially becoming refugees.\n\n“After a storm,” Stoddard explains, “it’s harder to sell your house.” If a devastating storm comes through and decimates South Florida and people move out, the city ends up with a lot of vacancies. A drop in the property taxes would erode city and county coffers. The first thing to go would be municipal services, Stoddard adds. With limited sanitation and maintenance services, cities and towns begin falling apart.\n\nDespite this threat looming on the horizon, there doesn’t seem to be enough planning for how to handle the impending crash. “We know it’s coming—but nobody is taking preparations,” says Stoddard. “The federal government hasn’t developed a legal framework on how to help people deal with it.” Stoddard’s goal is to try to explain to people that the crash is coming. “My goal is to make it a slow slide, rather than a crash. … The slower the change happens, the more people are able to adapt to it. It can be bad or it can be really, really, really bad—take your choice.”",
  "latent_4417": "The San Francisco 49ers signed 12 undrafted free agents following the 2016 NFL Draft, with devon Cajuste viewed by many as the most likely impact player. Over the weekend, we opened a poll as to which UDFA would make the biggest impact aside from Cajuste. Alabama defensive tackle Darren Lake led the way, with Utah outside linebacker Jason Fanaika and Cal wide receiver Bryce Treggs right behind Lake.\n\nToday, I thought we'd look a little further back in the list of 49ers UDFAs. Here are the current players on the 90-man roster who signed as UDFAs the last two seasons.\n\n2015 UDFAs\n\nWR Dres Anderson\n\nWR DiAndre Campbell\n\nOLB Marcus Rush\n\nWR DeAndrew White\n\n2014 UDFAs\n\nTE Je'Ron Hamm (signed with Saints as UDFA)\n\nS L.J. McCray\n\nILB Shayne Skov\n\nDL Garrison Smith (signed with Dolphins as UDFA)\n\nMcCray and Skov have both emerged as core special teams players. It remains to be seen if either will ever emerge as more than that, and that will be something to track as they look to earn roster spots with an almost entirely new coaching staff.\n\nThe 49ers signed three receivers last year as undrafted free agents. Anderson ended up spending the season on injured reserve, Campbell was on the practice squad, and White earned a spot on the 53-man roster, albeit with a lot of weeks inactive. The 49ers have a lot of opportunities at the wide receiver position, but they also have DeAndre Smelter returning from ACL recovery, they signed Eric Rogers after he led the CFL in receiving, and they drafted Aaron Burbridge.\n\nMarcus Rush or Garrison Smith are serious options to earn roster spots on the defensive side of the ball. The 49ers did not add an outside linebacker in the draft, although they signed Jason Fanaika and Lenny Jones as UDFAs. As for the nose tackle position, with Ian Williams dealing with ankle issues, it opens the door for another defensive lineman to emerge. Smith and Darren Lake could be competing for that kind of opportunity.\n\nWho do you think is the guy to emerge with any kind of role in 2016, or a bigger role in the case of Skov, McCray, and White?",
  "latent_4453": "MONTREAL — When Eluzor and Vita Moscowicz welcomed five young foster children into their home about six months ago, they were shocked by their appearance and demeanour.\n\nThe kids, ranging from infancy to seven years old, had been entrusted to them by Quebec’s youth protection officials after they were removed from the controversial Lev Tahor chassidic sect, then based in Ste-Agathe des Monts, Que.\n\nEluzor Moscowicz said the children were not clean and wore shoes that were so ill-fitting that they were not walking normally.\n\nEven the toddler girls were attired from head to toe in the black chador-like cloaks and kerchiefs that all female members of the sect are required to wear.\n\nDisturbing as well was their suspicion and timidity, even about taking a shower or using soap that might have a scent, and the boys’ fear that their heads would be shaved with a straight razor, as was the custom each Friday among the Lev Tahor.\n\nMoscowicz was struck by the children’s habit of talking against one another, behaviour that he persuaded them was not right, reassuring them they were all now loved and safe.\n\nHis wife sent written testimony about the children to a Knesset committee, which has been hearing from Israeli relatives of Lev Tahor members who are worried about what is going on within the group.\n\nAllegations against it include forced underage marriage, failure to provide adequate education and inappropriate discipline of children using force\n\nMoscowicz said in an interview that the foster children’s father ran afoul of Lev Tahor chief leader, Rabbi Shlomo Helbrans, when his unhappiness with the sect became apparent. He made plans to leave and bring his family with him.\n\nRabbi Helbrans had already split up the family, placing the children among other families in the community because he felt they were not being brought up according to his notions of proper Jewish practice.\n\nMoscowicz said the authorities got involved after Lev Tahor leaders called in the police, claiming the father was acting violently, including abusing his kids.\n\nThe father lodged a complaint with youth protection that his kids were not being adequately cared for by the Lev Tahor families they were with.\n\nMoscowicz, a marriage counsellor and social worker, came into the picture when a rabbinical council serving Outremont-area chassidic communities asked him to interview the couple to see if their troubled marriage was salvageable.\n\nToday, the five children live in the Moscowiczs’ comfortable house in Mile End, in the heart of a chassidic neighbourhood. The couple have six children of their own, with five still living at home. Their eldest teenaged daughters have been a great help.\n\nHow long they will be in foster care has not been determined, Moscowicz said.\n\nThree of the children were seen by a visitor one day. They appeared healthy and happy, flourishing under the care of this gentle couple who clearly love children. One laughing toddler repeatedly came in to show her foster father a new bow in her hair.\n\nTheir father, who no longer belongs to Lev Tahor, lives in Montreal and visits his children almost daily, Moscowicz said. Their mother remains with Lev Tahor, which last November resettled in Chatham, Ont.\n\nShe has had health problems, Moscowicz said, and has little contact with the children.\n\nMoscowicz’s claims that the children were not cared for well within Lev Tahor were refuted by the group’s spokesperson, Uriel Goldman.\n\nGoldman told The CJN that Moscowicz is making assumptions based on hearsay.\n\n“He never was in Lev Tahor, ever. He never came to meet with us,” Goldman said.\n\nMoscowicz is the descendant of a rabbinical dynasty of one of the smaller chassidic groups, and identifies today most closely with the Satmar and Belz communities. He wears the traditional earlocks and short pants. He was born and grew up in Montreal, and left for Israel where he married and lived for around 15 years before returning to Montreal about five years ago.\n\nWhen the rabbinical court approached him last year he said, he knew little about Lev Tahor. “I heard people talking about them. It was very scary. But it was not my business, what could I do?” He was reluctant at first when the rabbis asked him to speak to the couple, whom he met separately.\n\nSince fostering the children, Moscowicz has been contacted by former Lev Tahor members who have told him about life on the inside. He never visited their former Ste-Agathe enclave himself.\n\nMoscowicz said he personally has met three women who were forced to marry while underage, and has heard reliable information about others.\n\nGoldman denied that members are cowed by their leader. Goldman, who has been with Lev Tahor for more than 20 years, said he comes from a prominent Israeli family – his father was a surgeon – and served in the Israel Defence Forces.\n\n“These are ridiculous allegations. Rabbi Helbrans is a straight guy. He says exactly what he thinks. You can ask him anything directly… about why you are doing this… Every single point is discussed.\n\n“But we believe that if you practise Judaism, it has to be the right way. This is very reasonable.”\n\nAs for the order by a Quebec court in November, upheld on Feb. 3 by an Ontario court, that 14 children from two Lev Tahor families should be placed in temporary foster care because of gross neglect, Goldman responded that the community was under investigation for two years and received “hundreds” of visits by police and child-welfare workers and “they found nothing… We were not charged with anything.\n\n“It is very difficult to hide such a thing [abuse]. If small children are questioned a lot by a social worker, if there is a trauma like that, they will talk.”\n\nIt would be “impossible,” in any case, he added, because abuse is “against the Torah.”\n\nHe said Lev Tahor wants to go to court and be cross-examined on these allegations. “Take us to court. Let’s see if it’s true or not.”\n\nMoscowicz said Lev Tahor believes, as is prescribed in the Zohar, that if at least one community of Jews in the world adheres “100 per cent” to Judaism then the Mashiach will come.\n\n“For sure, the way they are acting is against the Torah, against everything it means for normal living,” said Moscowicz. “But [Rabbi] Helbrans mixes in a lot of Judaism, and they pray so well and long, but it is all forced. By us, no one is forced to pray.”\n\nMoscowicz is worried about the 18-minute video Rabbi Helbrans released on Feb. 14, in which he accuses child-welfare workers, the courts and other authorities of persecuting Lev Tahor, going so far as to charge that they are the victims of attempted “genocide.”\n\nMoscowicz has not seen the video, only heard about it, but said, “We have to answer that video. We are not fighting with Quebec, and Quebec is not fighting with us. Youth protection is not against Lev Tahor. They are trying to help the children, and we have to be thankful.”\n\nCentre for Israel and Jewish Affairs Quebec vice-president Luciano Del Negro said he is satisfied that the Quebec youth protection department has acted with thoroughness and sensitivity in dealing with Lev Tahor.\n\n“Youth protection has acted in a responsible manner. It didn’t rush in… It did due diligence and ensured that any action taken was evidence-based,” he said. “And not one, but two judges has found the evidence compelling…\n\n“A great deal of thought and care went into determining how to act in the best interests of the children and meet their specific needs.”",
  "latent_4490": "For other people with similar names, see Edward Robertson (disambiguation)\n\nLloyd Edward Elwyn \"Ed\" Robertson (born October 25, 1970) is a Canadian musician, best known as the lead singer, guitarist, and songwriter of the band Barenaked Ladies. He, along with former member Steven Page, founded the group in 1988. As of Page's departure in 2009, Robertson and bassist Jim Creeggan are the only remaining original members of the band.\n\nBiography [ edit ]\n\nEarly and personal life [ edit ]\n\nRobertson was born in Scarborough, Ontario. He is the youngest of five children, with two sisters, Lynn and Bonnie, and two brothers, Bill and Doug;[1][2] He claims to have been named on a bet. His mother, Wilma, was a secretary for Imperial Oil, and his father, Earl, worked both as a shipping foreman for Honeywell, and as an egg grader.[3] He believes that his conception was an \"accident\" because he is several years younger than his siblings, who were all born about one year apart. He credits this situation with allowing him to have the experience of being both in a big family, and an only child—once his siblings moved out of their home.[4]\n\nRobertson began working part-time when he was 13 years old. He has bragged about being named employee of the month at his local Wendy's in July 1985 (he considers this his life's greatest accomplishment).[3] He also answered phones at a CAA office.[3] Robertson appeared in the music video for \"All We Are\" by Kim Mitchell from Mitchell's 1985 album Akimbo Alogo.\n\nRobertson was brought up in a home where country music was played almost exclusively; he is still fond of it today. He sang harmonies with his family and learned how to play guitar, which his father also played.[5] Once he began playing guitar for other people, around grade five, he knew he wanted to be a performer.[4] He was in several bands during his school days including a band that covered a collection of rock artists, such as Rush and Kim Mitchell.\n\nIn grade four, Robertson entered the gifted program at Churchill Heights Public School. Robertson's first run-in with Steven Page, who was a year ahead in the same gifted program, was when he unknowingly \"stole\" Page's best friend. It would be several years before the two would really speak to each other. Page saw Robertson at a Harvey's restaurant after a Peter Gabriel concert and was surprised to find that Robertson was also a fan. This ultimately led to them talking and becoming friends.[4]\n\nRobertson attended Woburn Collegiate Institute with Page and, around grade twelve, realized he needed to focus on passing his courses to get into university, believing his goal of being musician was somewhat of a \"pipe dream\". It was around this point when he began playing with Page.[4] The two became counsellors at Scarborough Schools Music Camp in the summer of 1988, and spent a lot of time together singing songs and playing guitar. Page was flattered that Robertson knew some of the songs he had written, which Robertson had learned after acquiring a copy of a cassette tape Page had recorded. Page was also impressed by Robertson's ear for singing harmony.[6] Upon receiving a telephone call from an organizer of a benefit concert which Robertson had committed his recently broken-up band to play, Robertson quickly advised that he would still be performing but the name of the band had changed to Barenaked Ladies, a name he had previously joked with Page about. Robertson then phoned Page and invited Page to be his bandmate in Barenaked Ladies. The benefit concert marked the first performance of the duo as Barenaked Ladies.\n\nRobertson was accepted to York University, but dropped out after only half a year, choosing to devote his time completely to the band. He and Page spent the next two years building the reputation and following for Barenaked Ladies, joined along the way by Andy and Jim Creeggan, and Tyler Stewart.\n\nRobertson was the second member of Barenaked Ladies to get married, and the first to have children. He married his longtime girlfriend, Natalie Herbert,[1][2] in June 1994. They had their first child, Hannah on November 17, 1995; their second child, Lyle was born September 29, 1999; and their third child, Arden was born August 7, 2002. As the first in the band to have children, he was also one of the first to advocate for spending less time touring and more time at home with family. When he is not working with Barenaked Ladies, Robertson prefers to spend as much time as he can with his family in Toronto, or at their Bancroft-area cottage.\n\nRobertson's brother Doug died after crashing his motorcycle in June 1993.[3] The experience affected Ed, which came through in his songwriting. The song \"Am I The Only One?\" from the 1994 Barenaked Ladies album Maybe You Should Drive, which he had been writing about his then-future wife, ended up being about the loss of his brother; the song \"Leave\" from 1998's Stunt is about the image of his brother haunting him in hotel rooms while on tour; and the song \"Tonight is the Night I Fell Asleep at the Wheel\" from 2000's Maroon was based on Robertson's curiosity about what his brother was thinking about in his last moments.[3] His mother died on December 13, 2008 at age 72,[1] and his father died on June 10, 2011 at the age of 76.[2][7] Robertson wrote the song \"Moonstone\" about his mother passing away. It was recorded during the All in Good Time sessions, and although it was not included in the basic album, it was released as a bonus track.\n\nRole in Barenaked Ladies [ edit ]\n\nRobertson is the primary guitarist for the band, playing dominantly rhythm guitar (evenly split between acoustic and electric) on nearly all of the band's songs. Two of his three bandmates also play guitar with the band on certain songs (Kevin Hearn sometimes on lead, and Jim Creeggan occasionally playing rhythm guitar for songs he sings lead on). During his tenure with the band, Steven Page also played rhythm guitar and, occasionally, lead guitar on around a third of the band's songs. Robertson is capable of playing several other instruments including drums, pedal steel guitar, banjo and mandolin, but he rarely plays anything other than guitar, or occasionally 6-string banjo, on stage. On each passing album, he has sung lead on an increased number of songs, to the point where he shared approximately equal duty with Page by the time the latter left the band. Robertson has sung lead on a number of the band's singles since the success of 1998's \"One Week\", the first single released with a Robertson lead (not including \"If I Had $1000000\" which featured a Page/Robertson call-and-response lead vocal). He, along with his other bandmates, has taken over some of Page's lead and harmony vocal parts following the latter's departure. Robertson also often includes rapping and beatboxing into performances with Barenaked Ladies.\n\nRobertson contributed to the writing for the band from their first album. Much of his contribution initially came in the way of co-writing with Page. As the years have passed, Robertson has written an increased amount on his own. He credits Jason Plumb in part for changing his perspective on songwriting, in that instead of trying to write one great song, he would commit to writing a certain number of ideas and they might not all be great, but parts of the songs would sometimes fit together into great songs. As well, Plumb encouraged Robertson to simply come up with an idea that fascinates him, and then to analyse it. The first song he wrote with this method was \"When I Fall\", based on the concept of \"a window washer who's afraid of heights\".\n\nBesides Tyler Stewart, who does not typically compose, Robertson is the only other band member who has not written and recorded songs outside of the Barenaked Ladies for himself in the form of a side project. Robertson has preferred to spend creative energy outside the band in co-writing and producing songs for other people (including Andy Kim and Jason Plumb).\n\nIn 2002, Robertson won an International Achievement Award at the SOCAN Awards in Toronto for the song \"Pinch Me\" that he co-wrote with Steven Page.[8]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nIn 2006, Robertson began starring in Ed's Up for OLN Canada.[3] The program covers his journeys by plane to various locations given to him only in the form of GPS coordinates. At these locations, he learns about and participates in a local occupation. The series premiered on November 1, 2006; Robertson filmed a second season in the summer of 2007, which premiered on November 7.[9] A third season was filmed over the summer of 2008.\n\nIn 2008, Ed Robertson guest co-hosted Daily Planet on Discovery Channel for several weeks while one of the regular hosts was away.\n\nHe can be seen in a handful of season 8 and 9 episodes of Degrassi: The Next Generation as the music teacher, Mr. Fowler, which aired new in 2009 on Canada's CTV and TeenNick in the States.\n\nOn May 29, 2012, Robertson was the guest co-host on the U.S. television morning talk show, Live with Kelly.\n\nFrom 2004, Robertson voiced the occasionally recurring character of Captain Butch Flowers/Agent Florida in the web series Red vs. Blue.\n\nOther activities and interests [ edit ]\n\nRobertson received his pilot's license in 2005, and the 2007 season of Ed's Up was purportedly designed around his attempting to earn his floatplane license. He also rides a motorcycle, which he has taken on some of the band's tours in the past to ride during off-time.\n\nIn April 2009, Robertson was recognized for his interest in aviation and the Canadian military by being named Honorary Colonel of 424 Transport and Rescue Squadron of the Canadian Forces.[10] Following the signing, HCol Robertson said that the investiture was \"the most incredible honour\" he has received. \"I have always been thoroughly blown away by the incredible work of our military,\" he said. \"It’s a day I thought I would never see come. When I got the letter from the Defence Minister, I was, like, ‘This is real; I am actually going to be an honorary colonel!’\"[11] Robertson held the position until March 2012, noting that, although he had not been able to be around as much as he would have liked, the Squadron felt like family to him.[10]\n\nRobertson is fan of video games, and claims to have had almost every console system released since he was a child. He usually brings several consoles and many games on tour with him. Robertson is a fan of the popular Rooster Teeth series Red vs. Blue, lending his voice to the series to voice Captain Butch Flowers, during a time travel episode in the third season. Originally for a one-off episode, Flowers was re-introduced late in the fifth season, four episodes before the season finale. Flowers later made an appearance in the season finale of the tenth season. Rooster Teeth Productions has also made special videos, using Red vs. Blue characters, to be shown at Barenaked Ladies shows. In February 2009, he starred as Captain Dynamic, in Rooster Teeth Productions live action mini-series, Captain Dynamic, which promotes the video game City of Heroes.\n\nRobertson is an avid pinball player and collector. The title of Barenaked Ladies 2015 album \"Silverball\" reflects this, and the music video for the title track was filmed in Robertson's own collection of 10 pinball machines. In February 2016 Ed appeared on the popular Twitch pinball stream \"Bro, Do You Even Pinball?\" where he talked about his love for the game and competed against the shows hosts from Buffalo Pinball.\n\nRobertson won Humber College's inaugural Euterpe Award at the close of the 2005 Humber Songwriting Workshop. In his honour, the school named a scholarship after him for their summer songwriting workshop.\n\nHaving an interest in acting, Robertson had a brief appearance in Charlie's Angels 2, which was offered to him by director Joseph McGinty Nichol, who had directed Barenaked Ladies' video for \"One Week\". Robertson had a larger role in the independent Canadian film Love, Sex and Eating the Bones, which was directed by childhood friend Sudz Sutherland.\n\nRobertson collaborated with astronaut and musician Chris Hadfield in writing a brand new song for Music Monday 2013. Music Monday is a Canadian event to spread the importance of music education.[12] The song, written by Ed and Chris, premiered on February 7, 2013 with Chris joining in from the International Space Station.[13][14][15]\n\nPlane crash [ edit ]\n\nAt 12:30 pm on August 24, 2008, Robertson was involved in a plane crash while piloting his amphibious Cessna 206, north of Bancroft, Ontario. He and his three passengers walked away from the crash with no apparent injuries. The Transport Canada Civil Aviation Daily Occurrence Report (CADOR) indicated that the crash occurred after take-off from Baptiste Lake when Robertson apparently lost airspeed and settled into the trees approximately 300 metres in from the shoreline.[16] The Transportation Safety Board handled the investigation.[17] After several weeks, the TSB was unable to determine a cause of the crash, but cleared Robertson of any misconduct. Additionally, no evidence of mechanical problems was found. Investigator Ray Simpson reported that the investigation was unlikely to produce any further results, and had therefore been essentially closed. Simpson added that undetectable air currents could have been the cause of the crash, but there is no evidence for or against the possibility. He commended Robertson for being \"outstanding\" in his cooperation with the investigation.[18]",

  "latent_4643": "CLOSE Protesters in Palm Springs called for the city to become a sanctuary city. (Jan. 31, 2017) Jay Calderon/The Desert Sun\n\nA man holds a poster of a woman wearing an American flag hijab during a protest Jan. 31, 2017, at Palm Springs City Hall in Palm Springs, Calif. (Photo11: Jay Calderon, The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun)\n\nPALM SPRINGS, Calif. — California cannot stop federal immigration officers from conducting deportation raids in the Golden State.\n\nHowever, the state can stop local cops and deputies from helping the feds enforce immigration law.\n\nCalifornia’s \"sanctuary state bill,\" officially known as Senate Bill 54, aims to severely restrict how much local law enforcement can work with Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But the bill would not completely eradicate cooperation between local and federal law enforcement.\n\nRiverside County Sheriff Stan Sniff described the dynamic like this: “If a checkpoint is conducted somewhere, we don’t invite them. But the reality is they can drop by any time they want.”\n\nThe Desert Sun spoke with lawyers, academics, activists and law enforcement experts to find out what SB 54 is and isn’t. It is important to note that the current draft of the bill could be different from the one that becomes law, assuming it becomes law at all.\n\n► Related: Trump, in strategy shift, considers new executive order on travel ban\n\nThe current version of the bill would kick ICE and U.S. Customs and Border Protection out of local jails and restrict their access to some state databases. It also would ban state agencies from asking and collecting anyone’s immigration status.\n\nPolice departments and sheriffs’ offices still would work with ICE and Customs and Border Protection on multi-agency task forces, which sometimes result in deportations. Federal immigration authorities still would have access to fingerprint data from everyone booked into a local jail.\n\nWhat does it mean to be a sanctuary?\n\nNeither federal nor state laws have defined sanctuary cities, so the term means different things to different people.\n\n“The biggest misconception is that people think that when you declare yourself a sanctuary it means that there is absolutely no contact with ICE, and that is not true,” said Marissa Montes, co-director of the Loyola Immigrant Justice Clinic at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles. “If ICE wanted to have a raid in downtown LA and did everything procedurally correct, like get a warrant, the city would not be able to stop them.”\n\n“The biggest misconception is that people think that when you declare yourself a sanctuary it means that there is absolutely no contact with ICE, and that is not true.” Marissa Montes, Loyola Marymount University\n\nSB 54 was introduced before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, but after a campaign in which he threatened to cut off federal money to cities that protect undocumented immigrants from deportation.\n\nWhen Trump signed an executive order that strips money from sanctuary cities, he defined sanctuaries as local and state governments that have enacted laws limiting communication of their residents’ immigration status with the Department of Homeland Security. These governments violate a federal statute.\n\nSB 54 specifies that it is not violating the federal statute. Instead, the bill aims to limit what information local agencies can gather so that when ICE asks about immigration status, local agencies are allowed to communicate but won’t have much to say.\n\nHowever, Trump’s order also gives his new attorney general, Jeff Sessions, authority to identify sanctuary cities. Sessions previously opposed immigration reform in the U.S. Senate and wants to limit legal and illegal immigration.\n\nThat discretion could be used against California to strip its federal money, but state officials would bring legal challenges.\n\n“I think (restricting funding) is legally a gray area right now,” said Ana Muniz, assistant criminology professor at University of California, Irvine. “The federal government can’t compel local governments to act, but there is also the legality over the federal government forcing the state to act. Withholding money could be seen as an overstepping.”\n\nWhat would be the impact of becoming a sanctuary state?\n\nTrump inherited a massive immigration enforcement apparatus that includes ICE, the border patrol and immigration courts. That enforcement machine is used in a variety of ways to deport immigrants in the country illegally and immigrants in the country legally but have committed crimes.\n\nThe president can prioritize going after immigrants convicted of crimes, like Barack Obama did, or cast a wider net and go after those arrested but not convicted of crimes, like Trump has done.\n\nA private company called Management and Training Corp. runs the Imperial Regional Detention Facility in Calexico, Calif. (Photo11: Gustavo Solis, The (Palm Springs, Calif.) Desert Sun)\n\nIn California, the majority of cooperation between local and federal agencies happens in county jails and is completely voluntary.\n\nMany jails allow ICE agents to interview inmates suspected of being in the country illegally. Some jails also tell ICE when certain inmates will be released so federal agents can detain those inmates as soon as they are out on bail or are finished serving their sentence.\n\nAs now written, the sanctuary state bill would prohibit the use of state facilities for immigration enforcement purposes. This would essentially kick ICE out of county-run jails.\n\n“Saying we cannot provide access to individuals in our jails is problematic,” said Cory Salzillo, legislative director for the California State Sheriffs’ Association.\n\nSalizillo said barring ICE from jails may result in a missed opportunity for the federal government to speak with and identify deportable immigrants while they are incarcerated. Inmates could be released after serving their time and commit more crimes in the U.S.\n\nAdditionally, Salzillo said the bill is vague on local participation in multi-agency task forces and may limit local participation on anti-gang or human trafficking operations.\n\nState Sen. Jeff Stone, a Republican from Temecula, Calif., also opposes the bill because he is worried it may make it difficult for federal law enforcement to catch dangerous criminals.\n\n► Related: Mexico warns citizens of 'new reality' after undocumented mom deported from Arizona\n\nSupporters of the bill call those concerns a fear tactic, saying the Department of Homeland Security would still have access for fingerprint data. They argue that people who have served their sentence already have paid their debt to society and shouldn’t be punished a second time.\n\n“We have a criminal justice system to respond to those concerns,” said Grisel Ruiz, staff lawyer for the Immigrant Legal Resource Center. “We already have everyone going through that system. Why are we submitting immigrants to another?”\n\nWhat are California's current immigration policies?\n\nTwo California laws, the Trust Act and the Truth Act, already limit specific aspects of type of in-jail cooperation.\n\nThe first law, passed in 2013, prevented jails from accepting detainers or immigration holds, asking them to hold inmates longer than their sentence so that federal agents could pick them up. Several aspects of detainers have been ruled unconstitutional in lower courts and the practice largely has been phased out in California, according to the Immigrant Legal Resource Center.\n\n► Related: Trump: Feds may defund Calif. over sanctuary-state push\n\nThe second law, passed last year, addresses tactics ICE uses to interview inmates in jail.\n\nImmigration cases are civil, not criminal; therefore, defendants don’t have the same rights.

  "latent_4652": "The Trade Deficit and Secular Stagnation\n\nJustin Wolfers had a piece in the NYT today warning that we face a situation in which the Fed may often find itself facing the zero lower bound, where it is unable to stimulate the economy further by lowering the short-term federal funds rate that is directly under its control. Wolfers notes that this can mean that growth ends up being slower and unemployment higher than would otherwise be the case. He argues that it should be possible to counteract this weakness with more aggressive use of countercyclical fiscal policy, which means increasing government spending during downturns.\n\nWhile Wolfers' argument for the merits of countercyclical fiscal policy is reasonable, it is worth stepping back and asking about the origins of secular stagnation. The basic story is that we are looking at an economy in which investment spending is weak, partly due to low labor force growth, and consumption spending is also weak, in part due to the upward redistribution of income. (Rich people spend a smaller share of the their income than the middle class and poor.)\n\nHowever, an important part of the demand story is net exports. Back in the old days, economists used to argue that rich countries should run trade surpluses. The idea is that capital is relatively abundant in rich countries, while it is relatively scarce in developing countries. This meant that capital would get a higher return in developing countries than in rich countries, so that we should expect rich nations to be net lenders of capital to developing countries. This lending would facilitate their growth.\n\nThe implication of being net lenders is that rich countries would run trade surpluses with developing countries. This would allow them to feed and house their populations, even as they built up their infrastructure and capital stock.\n\nAs it turns out, the world economy has not followed this course. While the rich countries as a whole (not the United States) were big net lenders in the 1990s, after the East Asian financial crisis in 1997, the flows switched course. Developing countries became big net lenders, as they began to run large trade surpluses especially with the United States. (The harsh terms of the I.M.F. bailout, engineered by Larry Summers, Robert Rubin, and Alan Greenspan, deserves the blame here.)\n\nThis matters for the secular stagnation story since the United States is still running a trade deficit of around 3.0 percent of GDP (close to $540 billion a year). If we envision a world in which consumption, investment, and government spending were unchanged, but trade was balanced, we would have far more demand in the economy.\n\nThe elimination of the trade deficit would have an effect on demand that is equivalent to a jump in annual investment, consumption, or government spending of $540 billion. This would almost certainly be large enough to push the economy to full employment or beyond. In other words, we would not be discussing secular stagnation if trade was balanced.\n\nOf course, there is no magic to balanced trade, but the point here is straightforward, a big part of the secular stagnation story is the trade deficit. It creates a gap in demand that is not easily filled. It might be worth some thinking as to why trade and capital flows are not following the textbook model and trying to take steps to address this problem (e.g. lower the value of the dollar).",

  "latent_4754": "David Cronenberg has made some unsettling films in his extraordinary career, “Dead Ringers,” “The Fly” and “Crash” among them. His latest film, “Maps to the Stars,” is a change of pace for the Canadian filmmaker — it is the first film he's shot in Los Angeles — but it is no less uncomfortable or unflinching. Set in the world of show business, and written by Bruce Wagner (“I’m Losing You”), the film depicts the personal and professional struggles of a handful of interconnected characters seeking fame and/or family.\n\nFresh off her best actress Academy Award win, Julianne Moore is a standout as an aging actress who hires a mysterious personal assistant (Mia Wasikowska). Other characters include a limo driver (Rob Pattinson), a post-rehab teen actor (Evan Bird) and a Scientologist-like doctor (John Cusack). Many of these characters are haunted by ghosts, and fearful of their futures. Cronenberg’s film captures their messy lives and bad behavior with considerable aplomb.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe filmmaker spoke to Salon about making “Maps to the Stars,” working with his actors, several of whom are playing actors, and examining the human condition.\n\n“Maps to the Stars” is an arch, cynical film, and both honest and contemptuous about Hollywood. Do you feel this a cautionary tale, or are you biting the hand that feeds you?\n\nNeither. Hollywood hasn’t fed me very much. Biting their hand would be gratuitous. I’ve always been an independent filmmaker. But on the other hand, I was thinking about Bruce Wagner, who wrote it. In “Le Monde,” there was a headline: “I Don’t Hate Hollywood.” They quoted that because when they saw the film at Cannes, [they thought] I must have had this long-simmering resentment or bitterness. I said “Absolutely not!” I have great affection for Hollywood’s past and future. I never would have thought about this film were it not for Bruce’s script. As a director, I was playing the role of Bruce Wagner and thinking the way he was thinking. Though it’s acerbic and nasty, there’s also a deep emotionality about it, and a sadness. So we’ve resisted calling it satire — which is specific. Jon Stewart and Jonathan Swift do satire. This was too realistic, more of a docudrama. For me, it is an intense way of examining the human condition. It’s not unique to Hollywood. It is about ambition and cruelty and intense relationships that get into strange areas. I don’t think of it as reflexive.\n\nYou employ your trademark detached style to the film. How did you connect with this material?\n\nMy technique is the same as on all my other movies. My approach comes from my nervous system, good or bad. I try to be kind of neutral. I said to the actors, don’t exaggerate the satirical or grotesque elements. Play it straight, with emotional reality. The other elements will take care of themselves. Some call my neutral stance “cold.” I call it unsentimental. The characters expose themselves and who they are to the audience.\n\nMany of the characters are haunted by their past (save maybe Robert Pattinson’s limo driver). Can you discuss the ghost/fantasy elements in the film?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nI don’t think of it as a fantasy at all. Bruce heard every line spoken in this film by someone he knew. The ghosts are memories. Not like in “The Sixth Sense.” You can be haunted by people you know who have died, and I have experienced that myself. But when they speak to me, they are in my life as a memory, not outside human life. I played those scenes more as memory/hallucination to address guilt and regret than actual traditional ghosts.\n\nHow did you identify with these characters and make them sympathetic even when they were on their worst behavior?\n\nIt’s interesting. I am working with actors who are not concerned about being sympathetic. The crises and conundrums the characters are in are familiar because of the presence these people have publicly on red carpets. They too have these family struggles, career ambitions that are dashed or thwarted, or identity problems — having enough esteem to think they are worthwhile. In Hollywood, it’s visible — you are on screen or the red carpet. There is a universality about the human condition, so you cast actors not afraid to be nasty or expose their weakness. It goes from funny-nasty to gradually being emotional — you feel their desperation — and finally it becomes very sad.\n\nHow did you work with the actors on their performances? Did you give them any particular guidance about the characters, or base them on any experiences you had making films?\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nThe less directing I do, the better off I am. When I have wonderful actors excited to play their roles, I let them show me their instincts on how to deliver the scenes. I don’t rehearse. I like to be surprised by their interactions. The first time I hear them speak the lines is during shooting. If they are off, I give them guidance. Each actor has their own methodology, and I wouldn’t impose. I’m not a Svengali who has to hypnotize Julianne Moore into giving a performance. When she’s playing the character, she believes it. They don’t need a lot of coaching. Ralph Fiennes told me he had the least direction from me in “Spider” than he ever had on a set. That was a huge compliment. Usually it’s the director’s ego, not his professionalism, on display. He has to show he can earn his money and make sure his presence is felt — move the camera around a lot when it would have been better to leave the camera still. With Ralph in “Spider,” we decided on his clothes, hair, make-up and walk. That was all the directing we did. By the time we were on set, he was Spider. Casting is a huge part, and an invisible part of the directing process. You can kill a film by miscasting it. That’s my technique. Woody Allen does the same thing.\n\nThere’s a pretty explicit sex scene, and a memorable moment with Julianne Moore on the toilet. Can you talk about your penchant for presenting things unfiltered, such as the sauna scene in “Eastern Promises”?\n\nIt’s a matter of realism. The sauna scene in “Eastern Promises” was Viggo saying, “I have to do this naked. It would be ridiculous to be in a towel.” I agreed. It’s a question of you and your actors understanding the level of realism and naturalism and not being artificial, false, or coy. If I had to shoot his fight without angles of his [naked] body, it would have been coy and obvious. Not to sound pretentious — okay, a little pretentious — I have a desire for cinematic truth. The toilet scene in “Maps to the Stars” — I won’t deny some actresses were intimidated by that. But it wasn’t a discussion for Julianne; for her it was no problem. She shared my understanding that the project is to present things as if the audience is really there watching it happen.",
  "latent_4801": "VIDEO: Native American Tribes Set To Receive Largest Government Settlement In History: $940M Over Contract Dispute\n\nApril V. Taylor\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Department of the Interior have proposed a historic $940 million settlement with a nationwide class of Native American Tribes and tribal entities to resolve a 25-year-old legal dispute related to claims that the U.S. contracted with tribes to run programs but did not pay the full amounts required by the law. The nearly $1 billion settlement with 645 Native American tribes stems from a 1990 lawsuit that claims the government failed to pay its portion of federal contracts for housing, education, law enforcement, healthcare and other support programs which left people on tribal lands decimated by suffering.\n\nThe case was brought before the Supreme Court in 2012, and justices ruled for the tribes. Zuni Pueblo governor Val Panteah states, “Deep and painful cuts were made every year,” that precipitated “a financial death spiral” for his community. He also states, “The federal government’s conduct was not just cruel and wrong, it was illegal.”\n\nThis is not the first massive class-action lawsuit to be settled between Native American tribes and the federal government in recent years. The government was forced to pay $3.4 billion in a 2010 settlement over royalties owed to generations of individual Indian landowners. In 2014, Navajo Nation leaders received $554 million from the Obama administration over the mismanagement of resources on its reservation.\n\nInterior Secretary Sally Jewell states, “This landmark settlement represents another important step in the Obama Administration’s efforts to turn the page on past challenges in our government-to-government relationship with tribes. Tribal self-determination and self-governance will continue to be our North Star as we navigate a new chapter in this important relationship and we are committed to fully funding contract support costs so that tribal contracting can be more successful.”\n\nThe settlement must still be approved by a federal judge. Unlike other settlements, it does not have to be approved by Congress, and the money would be taken from a judgment fund of the Treasury Department. It represents the largest government settlement in U.S. history. Tribes are scheduled to begin receiving payments from the settlement within the next six to ten months.\n\nSOURCE",
  "latent_4931": "As digital technologies and platforms are increasingly incorporated into our lives, we are exposed to new practices of data creation and collection — and there is evidence that American citizens are deeply concerned about the consequences of these practices. But despite these concerns, the public has not abandoned technologies that produce data and collect personal information. In fact, the popularity of technologies and services that reveal insights about our health, fitness, medical conditions, and family histories in exchange for extensive monitoring and tracking paints a picture of a public that is voluntarily offering itself up to increasingly invasive forms of surveillance.\n\nThis seeming inconsistency between intent and behaviour is routinely explained with reference to the “privacy paradox”. Advertisers, retailers, and others with a vested interest in avoiding the regulation of digital data collection have pointed to this so-called paradox as an argument against government intervention. By phrasing privacy as a choice between involvement in (or isolation from) various social and economic communities, they frame information disclosure as a strategic decision made by informed consumers. Indeed, discussions on digital privacy have been dominated by the idea of the “empowered consumer” or “privacy pragmatist” — an autonomous individual who makes informed decisions about the disclosure of their personal information.\n\nBut there is increasing evidence that “control” is a problematic framework through which to operationalize privacy. In her Policy & Internet article “From Privacy Pragmatist to Privacy Resigned: Challenging Narratives of Rational Choice in Digital Privacy Debates,” Nora A. Draper examines how the figure of the “privacy pragmatist” developed by the prominent privacy researcher Alan Westin has been used to frame privacy within a typology of personal preference — a framework that persists in academic, regulatory, and commercial discourses in the United States. Those in the pragmatist group are wary about the safety and security of their personal information, but make supposedly rational decisions about the conditions under which they are comfortable with disclosure, logically calculating the costs and benefits associated with information exchange.\n\nAcademic critiques of this model have tended to focus on the methodological and theoretical validity of the pragmatist framework; however, in light of two recent studies that suggest individuals are resigned to the loss of privacy online, this article argues for the need to examine a possibility that has been overlooked as a consequence of this focus on Westin’s typology of privacy preferences: that people have opted out of the discussion altogether. Considering a theory of resignation alters how the problem of privacy is framed and opens the door to alternative discussions around policy solutions.\n\nWe caught up with Nora to discuss her findings:\n\nEd.: How easy is it even to discuss privacy (and people’s “rational choices”), when we know so little about what data is collected about us through a vast number of individually innocuous channels — or the uses to which it is put?\n\nNora: This is a fundamental challenge in current discussions around privacy. There are steps that we can take as individuals that protect us from particular types of intrusion, but in an environment where seemingly benign data flows are used to understand and predict our behaviours, it is easy for personal privacy protection to feel like an uphill battle. In such an environment, it is increasingly important that we consider resigned inaction to be a rational choice.\n\nEd.: I’m not surprised that there will be people who basically give up in exhaustion, when faced with the job of managing their privacy (I mean, who actually reads the Google terms that pop up every so often?). Is there a danger that this lack of engagement with privacy will be normalised during a time that we should actually be paying more, not less, attention to it?\n\nNora: This feeling of powerlessness around our ability to secure opportunities for privacy has the potential to discourage individual or collective action around privacy. Anthropologists Peter Benson and Stuart Kirsch have described the cultivation of resignation as a strategy to discourage collective action against undesirable corporate practices. Whether or not these are deliberate efforts, the consequences of creating a nearly unnavigable privacy landscape is that people may accept undesirable practices as inevitable.\n\nEd.: I suppose another irony is the difficulty of getting people to care about something that nevertheless relates so fundamentally and intimately to themselves. How do we get privacy to seem more interesting and important to the general public?\n\nNora: People experience the threats of unwanted visibility very differently. For those who are used to the comfortable feeling of public invisibility — the types of anonymity we feel even in public spaces — the likelihood of an unwanted privacy breach can feel remote. This is one of the problems of thinking about privacy purely as a personal issue. When people internalize the idea that if they have done nothing wrong, they have no reason to be concerned about their privacy, it can become easy to dismiss violations when they happen to others. We can become comfortable with a narrative that if a person’s privacy has been violated, it’s likely because they failed to use the appropriate safeguards to protect their information.\n\nThis cultivation of a set of personal responsibilities around privacy is problematic not least because it has the potential to blame victims rather than those parties responsible for the privacy incursions. I believe there is real value in building empathy around this issue. Efforts to treat privacy as a community practice and, perhaps, a social obligation may encourage us to think about privacy as a collective rather than individual value.\n\nEd.: We have a forthcoming article that explores the privacy views of Facebook / Google (companies and employees), essentially pointing out that while the public may regard privacy as pertaining to whether or not companies collect information in the first place, the companies frame it as an issue of “control” — they collect it, but let users subsequently “control” what others see. Is this fundamental discrepancy (data collection vs control) something you recognise in the discussion?\n\nNora: The discursive and practical framing of privacy as a question of control brings together issues addressed in your previous two questions. By providing individuals with tools to manage particular aspects of their information, companies are able to cultivate an illusion of control. For example, we may feel empowered to determine who in our digital network has access to a particular posted image, but little ability to determine how information related to that image — for example, its associated metadata or details on who likes, comments, or reposts it — is used.\n\nThe “control” framework further encourages us to think about privacy as an individual responsibility. For example, we may assume that unwanted visibility related to that image is the result of an individual’s failure to correctly manage their privacy settings. The reality is usually much more complicated than this assigning of individual blame allows for.\n\nEd.: How much of the privacy debate and policy making (in the States) is skewed by economic interests — i.e. holding that it’s necessary for the public to provide data in order to keep business competitive? And is the “Europe favours privacy, US favours industry” truism broadly true?\n\nNora: I don’t have a satisfactory answer to this question. There is evidence from past surveys I’ve done with colleagues that people in the United States are more alarmed by the collection and use of personal information by political parties than they are by similar corporate practices. Even that distinction, however, may be too simplistic. Political parties have an established history of using consumer information to segment and target particular audience groups for political purposes. We know that the U.S. government has required private companies to share information about consumers to assist in various surveillance efforts. Discussions about privacy in the U.S. are often framed in terms of tradeoffs with, for example, technological and economic innovation. This is, however, only one of the ways in which the value of privacy is undermined through the creation of false tradeoffs. Daniel Solove, for example, has written extensively on how efforts to frame privacy in opposition to safety encourages capitulation to transparency in the service of national security.\n\nEd.: There are some truly terrible US laws (e.g. the General Mining Act of 1872) that were developed for one purpose, but are now hugely exploitable. What is the situation for privacy? Is the law still largely fit for purpose, in a world of ubiquitous data collection? Or is reform necessary?\n\nNora: One example of such a law is the Electronic Communication Privacy Act (ECPA) of 1986. This law was written before many Americans had email accounts, but continues to influence the scope authorities have to access digital communications. One of the key issues in the ECPA is the differential protection for messages depending on when they were sent. The ECPA, which was written when emails would have been downloaded from a server onto a personal computer, treats emails stored for more than 180 days as “abandoned.” While messages received in the past 180 days cannot be accessed without a warrant, so-called abandoned messages require only a subpoena. Although there is some debate about whether subpoenas offer adequate privacy protections for messages stored on remote servers, the issue is that the time-based distinction created by “180-day rule” makes little sense when access to cloud storage allows people to save messages indefinitely. Bipartisan efforts to introduce the Email Privacy Act, which would extend warrant protections to digital communication that is over 180 days old has received wide support from those in the tech industry as well as from privacy advocacy groups.\n\nAnother challenge, which you alluded to in your first question, pertains to the regulation of algorithms and algorithmic decision-making. These technologies are often described as “black boxes” to reflect the difficulties in assessing how they work. While the consequences of algorithmic decision-making can be profound, the processes that lead to those decisions are often opaque. The result has been increased scholarly and regulatory attention on strategies to understand, evaluate, and regulate the processes by which algorithms make decisions about individuals.\n\nRead the full article: Draper, N.A.

  "latent_4940": "SDCC 2013: AMC’s ‘The Walking Dead’ Panel\n\nA perennial San Diego Comic-Con favorite, AMC’s The Walking Dead once again made their panel appearance on Friday at Hall H.\n\nSeries stars Andrew Lincoln, Norman Reedus, Steven Yeun, Lauren Cohan, Danai Gurira, David Morrissey (who came out to a mix of boos and applause for his villainous character), Scott Wilson, and Chad Coleman joined executive producer and showrunner Scott Gimple, executive producer Robert Kirkman, executive producer Gale Anne Hurd, executive producer Dave Alpert, and special effects makeup supervisor and executive producer Greg Nicotero in a panel moderated by Chris Hardwick (The Nerdist, Talking Dead).\n\nKirkman said this season would get “way crazier” than last season in an escalation of intensity. Gimple concurred “it’s going to get insane very quickly.” Nicotero said the show learns from past seasons how to build more originality into the show, like an upcoming “coolest walker gag ever.” Hurd said the crew spirit is high with the goal of bringing the best upcoming season ever. Alpert said the challenge of seeing characters written off the show drives the writers to work harder and making the show better. In regards to the characters thinking The Governor is gone forever, he said the most dangerous thing for the remaining cast is to get comfortable and complacent. This statement was followed by a trailer for the upcoming season.\n\nThe trailer showed that Woodbury, the prison where Rick and his group have made a home, is now compromised by walkers. More disturbingly, it seems like someone has been leading the walkers there; also, the walkers are coming in droves and are even more aggressive. It’s obvious from the footage that a lot of characters are in danger and won’t see it through til the end of the season.\n\n“Why go back to the prison?,” asked Hardwick. Lincoln said that gets answered this season, while Rick finds himself in a new place, repressing his brutality and renouncing some leadership in order to be a better parent.\n\nGurira said Michonne will start to open up to let herself be part of a family. She also said the physicality of the role doesn’t get easier, and she had to learn to ride a horse this season. Yeun said Glenn is constantly evolving and had to go through a terrible evolution with someone he cares about and now all he sees is vengeance and ends up pushing Maggie’s love aside. Cohan agreed that Maggie wanted to move on faster than Glenn, and that testing of the relationship propelled her character for the upcoming season. Wilson said his motivation for the upcoming season is just to hold onto his other leg! He said Herschel’s glad to be a part of such a tight on-screen family. Coleman said this is the kind of environment any actor would want to live in and as a character Tyrese is just trying to negotiate the rules of the group, but is motivated to do the right thing, despite the world not allowing him to operate that way. Morrissey said the Governor has felt betrayed and is looking for revenge this season. Before shooting the new season, he thought the Governor would snap and deal with his failure in a bad way. Reedus was moved when reading the script where Merle died and feels that his character needed that change in order for him to grow up. Lincoln said Andrea’s death was the catalyst his character needed to move on as well. Gurira said despite the ugliness of the world around them, there is beauty and hope to be had.\n\nFan Q&A started with a question asking if Michonne and Rick might get together since Andrea is dead, to which Kirkman replied, “Anything is possible.” Reedus and Gurira were asked how the recent deaths of those close to their characters would drive them moving forward. As loner characters, Reedus said they’d likely bond in condolences and who knows what might happen.\n\nLincoln said it’s the first time he’s done a show that’s lasted so long, and he finds it hard to see characters dying off. He was floored seeing the death of Andrea, and in particular how it affected Rick’s son. One of Lincoln’s favorite things working on the show is the unity of being pulled out of emotions by different characters at different times. Gurira noted that since Laurie Holden introduced her (and her character) into the world of The Walking Dead, it’s wrenching to see characters like Andrea die off. Kirkman mentioned that the screening room in Atlanta has a wall devoted to all the characters that have died, aptly called ‘The Grateful Dead’.\n\nYeun felt grateful that Glenn has been able to play so many aspects from young kid to action hero to lover, and also reiterated how hard it is to see a regular cast member like Dale die off. He also mentioned that John Bernthal, who played Shane, coaxed him to learn boxing at his gym just as Glenn was staring to become more of an action-heavy character.\n\nA fan asked when the Zombie Apocalypse actually happens, how would the panel prepare? Kirkman said he’d probably kill himself. Lincoln said he’d be useless, but Chandler Riggs (Carl) would be ready. Reedus said he’d take over a hotel, spraypaint himself silver, run around naked, and watch South Park. Lincoln and Morrissey were asked how their two alpha male characters fed off each other’s intensity. Morrissey said he was grateful of how well their fight scenes were written, and didn’t speak much to Lincoln outside of their well-rehearsed lines. Lincoln joked that on the day they shot, most of the crew wore shirts rooting for Rick, to which Morrissey protested in denial that they did not claiming that the shirts had eye patches on them (like his character).\n\nMorrissey was asked if his character would sing, in reference to a viral video from his role in Blackpool (see below). He said the Governor would likely not end up singing, nor would The Walking Dead likely have a musical episode.\n\nPanel Photos\n\nBe sure to follow Geeks of Doom’s Comic-Con coverage here at the site and through our Facebook and Twitter.",

Just really sorry,” he said.\n\nHis tearful apology, however, wasn’t expected to aid his appeal.\n\nThe NCAA’s drug policy states the appeal committee will not consider, “the type or amount of banned substance detected through the drug test; evidence of the student-athlete's good character; the degree of remorse demonstrated by the student-athlete; family hardship or history of family dysfunction; and the degree to which the banned substance may or may not affect athletic performance.”\n\nThe policy states the NCAA will only consider an argument the school's drug education program was inadequate and hindered Grier's judgment or he was unable to discern he was using a banned substance due to circumstances beyond his control.\n\nGrier has been allowed to practice with the Gators, but he has not done so since his suspension.\n\nSophomore Treon Harris replaced Grier and has started the past four games for the No. 8 Gators, who are 3-1 with Harris at quarterback.\n\nGrier shared quarterback duties with sophomore Treon Harris during the season’s first two games, but assumed full-time responsibilities during the team’s SEC opener Sept. 19 at Kentucky.\n\nAt the time of his suspension, Grier led the SEC with a completion percentage of 65.8 and had become the first Florida quarterback to pass for at 200 yards in three consecutive games since Tim Tebow in 2009.\n\nWhen he returns, Grier presumably will compete with Harris and transfer Luke Del Rio for the starting job.\n\nGrier will miss four SEC games – or half the Gators’ conference schedule.

Sharlene pleaded through tears at a press conference later that week for his safe return. \"It was just a truck, a stupid truck,\" she said. \"You don't need him, but I do.\"\n\nOne week later, police announced they had found Bosma's charred remains on a Waterloo area farm. There wasn't even enough of him left for a casket — the Bosma family said goodbye to a small box.\n\nWounds are still fresh for the Bosma family. Both Sharlene and Tim's parents are at every court appearance for the three people who have been charged in connection with his killing. They plan on marking the anniversary of Bosma's death privately. And family spokesman said they would be leaving the public eye for the month of May. The family will be hosting the \"Tim's Tribute\" charity golf tournament on June 6 at the Century Pines Golf Club in Flamborough. That event falls 13 months to the day of Bosma's disappearance and Sharlene is expected to make some public comments then.\n\nOne year later, two men have been charged with Bosma's murder, with a woman has been charged with being an accessory after the fact.

His burned remains were found days later.\n\nDellen Millard: Millard, 28, is the heir of the MillardAir aviation dynasty. He is charged with first-degree murder in connection with Bosma's death, as well as the death of his father Wayne and Toronto woman Laura Babcock, with whom he was romantically linked.\n\nMark Smich: 26-year-old Mark Smich is the second man charged in connection with the deaths of Bosma and Babcock. Smich was previously convicted on drug possession charges in 2005 and 2006 and on impaired driving charges in 2009.\n\nChristina Noudga: The 21-year-old Toronto woman has also been charged with being an accessory after the fact in connection to Bosma’s slaying. Crown attorney Anthony Leitch told CBC News that Noudga’s charges relate to an allegation that she tried to help Millard \"escape\" on May 9, 2013. He would not elaborate as to what was meant by escape, or from whom.\n\nLaura Babcock: Toronto woman Laura Babcock's death is now being considered the city's 55th homicide of 2012. Det. Mike Carbone told CBC News last June that Babcock was known to be involved in the sex-trade business for several months prior to her disappearance.\n\nWhat's next\n\nAnswers to what happened to Bosma likely won't come until at least 2015 when Millard and Smich's trial begins. An eight-week preliminary hearing has been set for September, 2014.\n\nNoudga remains in custody, and is due to appear in court again on May 22. Crown attorney Anthony Leitch told CBC News that Noudga’s bail hearing has to be handled in Superior Court because of the seriousness of the offence.\n\n“Only a handful of offences are handled this way,” he said. The prosecution will be requesting the court deny her bail.",

The previous mark was set by Gordie Bell of the Buffalo Bison during the 1942-43 season and later tied by Bridgeport’s Wade Dubielewicz in 2003-04.\n\nWith the game scoreless in the second period, Wilkes-Barre/Scranton went up, 2-0, in quick fashion on back-to-back goals by Tom Kostopoulos and Bobby Farnham. After the Penguins won a battle in the corner of the Phantoms zone, Kostopoulos circled off the near wall with the puck and let loose with a wrist shot that beat Lehigh Valley goalie Rob Zepp over the blocker at 11:15.\n\nFarnham doubled Wilkes-Barre/Scranton’s lead 63 seconds later when he outraced a defender to a loose puck at the near dot before hammering a shot that found the top right corner of the net for his fifth goal of the season.\n\nDown by two to start the third period, Lehigh Valley outshoot Wilkes-Barre/Scranton, 13-4, in the frame, but would be unable to get the puck past Murray. Defenseman Scott Harrington completed the scoring for the Penguins with an empty-net goal with 0.8 seconds left in regulation.\n\nMurray’s record goes to 21-8-3 on the season as the 20-year-old is 16-2-1 in his last 19 starts.

  "latent_5250": "Dr. Sanjay Gupta, a practicing neurosurgeon, is the multiple Emmy-award winning chief medical correspondent for CNN. The views expressed are his own. A version of this essay originally published in 2015.\n\n(CNN) I have started, scratched out and even abandoned the writing of this essay. I couldn't do it. It wasn't there. Didn't feel it.\n\nSomething kept nagging at me, and it took some time to finally figure out what it was.\n\nIt's the idea that this article would be labeled \"opinion\" or \"editorial\" in the first place.\n\nSure, there are some topics that seem to lend themselves appropriately to opinion pages. Vaccines, however, which have prevented 6 million deaths every year worldwide and have fundamentally changed modern medicine, should not be on that list.\n\nThe benefit of vaccines is not a matter of opinion. It is a matter of fact.\n\nThat you are 100 times more likely to be struck by lightning than to have a serious allergic reaction to the vaccine that protects you against measles is not a matter of opinion. That is also a matter of fact.\n\nFacts should matter, and science should win, but after 13 years as a medical reporter, I know it is not that simple.\n\nScience often loses the zeal argument to ideology, and in some ways, it is easy to understand why.\n\nAt the heart of the vaccine argument is the awesome challenge of trying to prove a negative.\n\nIf you or your child never gets the disease the vaccine was designed to prevent, there is no surprise. There is no headline. Life goes on.\n\nThe flip side, though, is the one-in-a-million child ( literally, 1/1,000,000 ) who has a serious adverse reaction. It is likely to make the news, confirm the worst fears and lead to the enlistment of an army in the fight against vaccines.\n\nIt is worth pointing out that 12 out of 10,000 people who take an aspirin are at risk of intracerebral hemorrhage, or bleeding in the brain. People who regularly take too much acetaminophen are the largest group of people hospitalized for acute liver failure. And, on average, one person in the United States dies every year from H20 intoxication, or drinking too much water. And yet no armies have formed against aspirin, Tylenol or water.\n\nDavid Katz, director of the Yale University Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center, wrote that it makes no more sense to rant against vaccines because you heard of someone who might have had an adverse reaction than to stop walking because you heard about a pedestrian struck by a car.\n\nIn many ways, it is a luxury to be able to have this discussion at all.\n\nHaving spent time in West Africa covering the Ebola outbreak , I saw how people hoped, wished and prayed for a vaccine -- to no avail.\n\nOn the other hand, the measles vaccine is readily available, and yet vaccination rates in certain areas of the United States are similar to the refugee camps I have visited in Haiti, Pakistan and Jordan.\n\nYes, parents have a choice in this country.\n\nIt is a choice that so many others around the world will never have.\n\nOf course I vaccinated my children. Didn't think twice. Not a big fan of the measles or mumps or rubella -- to name a few very preventable diseases.\n\nAnd here is where I may lapse for a moment into opinion.\n\nFollow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nThe anti-vaccination argument is often snugly wrapped in the \"I love my kids\" sentiment. And I find it, well, a little insulting.\n\nTo suggest that anyone who vaccinates their kids doesn't love them is a whole new level of lunacy. But here is the fact of the matter, for me.\n\nIt's not just because I love my kids that I vaccinated them. It's because I love your kids as well.",
  "latent_5372": "Senate Republican leaders are making clear they would rather have a Democrat join them in the Senate than Roy Moore, who has been accused of initiating sexual contact with a 14-year-old girl when he was in his 30s. But there's not much they can do about it before the election. Even if the Alabama Republican Senate candidate were to suddenly heed their calls to drop out, his name would still appear on the ballot in December's special election.\n\nAfter the election, though, is a different story. If nearly half of Senate Republicans join with all 48 Democratic senators, they could kick out the newest Alabama senator shortly after he takes a seat. The Constitution lets the Senate censure or even expel its members, but it hasn't successfully happened since the Civil War. In the wake of allegations that Moore dated teenage girls and touched a 14-year-old inappropriately (an allegation he denies), some senators seem to be considering it.\n\nSen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), chair of the committee charged with electing Senate Republicans, said in a statement Monday that if Moore refuses to withdraw from the race and he wins, the Senate \"should vote to expel him, because he does not meet the ethical and moral requirements of the United States Senate.\"\n\nYes, the Senate can do that. But it's not easy, and it hasn't happened in a long time. Here's how it would work, as guided by Senate procedural experts Sarah Binder of the Brookings Institution and Josh Chafetz of Cornell Law.\n\n1. Decide whether they can stop him from taking the seat: The Senate has constitutional power to decide whether to seat someone the voters elect, and that only requires a majority vote, Chafetz said. But the rules around this are pretty strict and probably don't follow this case: The Senate can only prevent someone from taking their seat if they either weren't duly elected or don't have the constitutional qualifications to be a senator (like being under the age of 30 or not a U.S. citizen). \"They can’t just exclude someone because they don’t like him or even because he has committed a crime; it has to be because he’s not actually entitled to a seat,\" Chafetz said.\n\n2. The Senate's Ethics Committee moves to conduct an investigation into Moore: Just like the Senate is running its own investigation into Russia meddling, senators almost certainly wouldn't vote to expel one of their own based on one news report, no matter how carefully reported it is. (As far as litigating decades-old sexual allegations in the media goes, this story is as close to proof as reporters can get.) They'd launch their own investigation, likely calling in witnesses and perhaps even talking to Moore himself.\n\nOne open question is whether his accusers would be willing to testify, either publicly or behind closed doors, potentially putting themselves through more trauma and scrutiny. A fifth Moore accuser who publicly shared her story Monday, Beverly Young Nelson, said she would be willing to testify under oath that Moore sexually assaulted her when she was 16.\n\n3. If the committee finds grounds to expel Moore, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) decides to bring up the question of expulsion for a vote before the full Senate. He hasn't commented publicly on whether he's even considering this. But on Monday, he did say he believes Moore's accusers and that Moore should voluntarily leave the race. He also didn't rule out helping sponsor a write-in campaign.\n\n4. Two-thirds of the Senate votes to expel him: That means all 48 senators who caucus with the Democrats, plus 19 Senate Republicans.\n\nThis last step in particular is an extraordinarily high bar to clear; getting a two-thirds majority in the Senate is one of the hardest things to do in politics. The requirement in the Senate to expel a senator is the same required to override a veto or change the Constitution. The last time the Senate had this much agreement on a controversial topic was when it sent new Russia sanctions to President Trump's desk.\n\nThough, if an ethics committee did decide that there was grounds to expel Moore, it'd probably become much easier to get behind the idea.\n\nExpelling a senator is also extraordinarily rare. Binder said the last senator expelled by the Senate was in 1862, when the Senate voted to expel more than two dozen members on the grounds of supporting the Confederacy during the Civil War.\n\nA century later, the Senate twice got close to kicking out senators only to see them step down. Moore's defiance to establishment Washington throughout this entire campaign suggests that's not something he'd consider.\n\nThere's another roadblock to getting rid of Moore. The Senate has a long-standing, unwritten rule that they don't kick out someone for conduct known to the voters at the time that senator was elected, Chafetz said.\n\nThe thinking behind that is to avoid a slippery slope where the Senate is overriding the will of the voters.\n\nFor now, this is mostly a theoretical debate. It's possible that Democrat Doug Jones beats Moore in the election next month. Before the allegations, Jones was already within a six-point margin, according to a RealClearPolitics average of polls. Afterward, some polls show him even.\n\nBut if Moore does pull out a win, the Senate could seriously consider doing something it hasn't done in more than a century: unseat one of their own.",

But all that will soon change, as Acer prepares to return to Windows Phone in the coming weeks.\n\nThe W4 was Acer's last Windows Phone, released in 2012\n\nBack in December, a report claimed that Acer was preparing to roll out \"a slew of Windows Phones\" this year, with the first devices being unveiled in the first half of 2015. It seems that that report was spot-on, as Digitimes reports that the company has now confirmed these plans.\n\nAccording to the report, Acer CEO Jason Chen told a conference of the company's suppliers and partners that it will launch new Windows Phones at the upcoming Mobile World Congress trade show in March.\n\nHowever, if you were hoping that the new addition to the Windows Phone family might offer a new high-end handset to choose from, you're going to be disappointed. As with all the other hardware brands that have joined the platform in recent months, Chen said that Acer 'will mainly focus on the entry-level segment', with no plans to launch flagship-class devices.\n\nAcer's return to Windows Phone has been fairly pedestrian in its pace, with the company first revealing plans to do so in mid-2013, with the intention of launching a WP handset in 1H 2014. Internal slides revealed that it aimed to provide \"a unique experience across Windows 8 and Windows Phone 8\", but the device never materialized.\n\nLast year, an Acer executive said that the company could not \"take the risk\" on Windows Phone until its market share and app store offerings improved further.\n\nSource: Digitimes via WMPU",

May wrote that they will be paid quickly.\n\n“While I understand your frustration at not being fully paid as of this date, the salacious headline-grabbing characterizations in your August 5th Investigative Update and its imprecise references will need more context in your final report for my administration to take proper action to restore the faith and trust in DeKalb County government,” May wrote.\n\nThe investigators have reported examples of widespread misconduct, with allegations that employees took bribes, drove county vehicle while drunk and spent public money on themselves.

Backers are pushing the council to authorize a November vote at its meeting Monday.\n\n“We are gratified to have finally cleared this hurdle and for I-27 to have officially qualified for the ballot.

The sites aim to reduce fatal overdoses and get drug users out of public alleys in favor of sites supervised by medical personnel who can encourage treatment options.\n\nDrug-use deaths in King County hit a record high of 332 last year, with two-thirds caused by heroin and other opioids, according a report released this month by University of Washington researchers.\n\nOpponents of safe-injection sites argue they amount to the government condoning heroin injection.

Shoring up his 9/11 credentials by bringing Rudy Giuliani along, Romney brought pizzas to Engine 24/ladder 5, a firehouse that lost 11 members on that fateful day. However, the photo op didn’t go perfectly. While Romney talked to the gathered press, thanking President Obama for taking bin Laden out but accusing him of politicizing the event, a protester began yelling, getting some choice words in while the live TV cameras were rolling.\n\nThe woman’s voice was hard to make out. It was clear that she began by repeating “Mitt Romney, you’re a racist!” over and over while the candidate attempted to continue answering questions. She went quiet for a few seconds before launching back in with a nice “Fuck you, Mitt Romney!”\n\nRomney raised his voice a bit and the rest of the protester’s shout was a bit overpowered.

  "latent_6449": "An Indiana man is in hot water with state tax officials over his alleged failure to pay a thousand dollars in state income tax. However, what makes this particular case interesting is the alleged tax cheat’s attempt to use rather unique defense that a newly enacted law can be used to protect him from what he sees as undue liability.\n\nThe Washington Post reports the alleged tax-cheat, Rodney Tyms-Bey, is attempting to argue that he cannot be found guilty of tax of evasion because he is protected under Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act.\n\nIn 2015, Indiana Governor (and now VP-elect) Mike Pence signed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act that required the government to first prove a compelling interest before it intrudes on a citizen’s “sincerely held religious beliefs.”\n\nTyms-Bey argues the imposition of a mandatory income tax law violates his religious beliefs. Under his interpretation of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, Tyms-Bey claims it can be used to protect him from prosecution However, when it came time to go to trial on the charges, a judge rejected Tyms-Bey’s interpretation on the law and prohibited the defense.\n\nAn appeal was immediately filed and the Indiana Court of Appeals heard oral argument on Monday.\n\nVictoria Bailey, Tyms-Bey’s appellate lawyer, tried to further explain her client’s position during oral argument.\n\n“Put another way, the Indiana General Assembly has decided that in certain circumstances, an individual’s right to exercise his religion is more important than the State of Indiana’s interest in enforcing its laws,” Bailey reportedly argued.\n\nThe Indiana Attorney General’s office countered Bailey’s argument by saying the “compelling government interest is that income tax funds the very existence of the government. It’s not that RFRA doesn’t apply. . . . It’s that no individual’s religious belief could ever prevail over a compelling government interest in the collection of income tax.”\n\nThe state also cited dozens of other cases in which courts ruled a person’s free exercise of religion does not trump the states interest in collecting taxes.\n\n[image via Shutterstock]",

The SEC, in an unanimous vote of its CEOs, said the Tigers will join the conference effective July 1, 2012 with competition in all sports beginning next school year.\n\nThe latest move in a four-month dance of conference realignment leaves the Big 12 with 10 schools and takes the SEC to 14. That will allow the SEC to play with seven-team football divisions next year. It is unclear where Missouri will go.

  "latent_6619": "Here is what you need to know on this Wednesday, August 9, 24 days before the Washington Redskins cut their roster to 53 on September 2.\n\nTimeline\n\nThe Redskins last played a game 220 days ago; they will open the 2017 season against the Eagles at FedEx Field in 32 days.\n\nToday’s schedule: Off day\n\nDays until:\n\n—Preseason opener @ Ravens (8/10) 1\n\n—Preseason vs. Packers at FedEx Field (8/19) 10\n\n—Sunday night Raiders @ Redskins (9/24) 46\n\nRedskins hot topics\n\nRICHMOND—A few topics from around Redskins training camp as they complete their preparations for their first preseason game.\n\n—The Junior Galette hype train is going full steam. The outside linebacker, sidelined for the last two seasons due to a pair of torn Achilles, will play an undetermined number of snaps against the Ravens tomorrow. “I hope everybody is as fired up as Junior. I think everybody is excited to get back on the field. I know Junior is after two years,” said Jay Gruden. “Obviously there’s a strong case for that. He’s put a lot of work in. I’m proud of the fact [of] what he’s accomplished getting his body right, getting his weight down, getting himself in football shape . . . He’s on the right track.”\n\n—Kirk Cousins is going to go behind center tomorrow and see only one pass catcher who is an anticipated Week 1 starter, Terrelle Pryor. On the bench with injuries will be Josh Doctson, Jamison Crowder, and tight end Jordan Reed. “It’s going to be a good test because I stood up here at the previous podium session a week or two ago and said the best quarterbacks as the players come and go around them, they continue to produce at a high level,” said Cousins. “And that’s certainly a goal of mine is to play well regardless of who’s in there. In this league, with how much attrition takes place, you’re not going to have the luxury of playing with the same starting receivers for 10 years. So, welcome to the NFL.”\n\nOr, perhaps more accurately, welcome to the NFL preseason. It’s possible that a least one or two of the three might be playing a little bit hurt if this was a game that counted.\n\n—The last two items here are fan questions from Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhat position group has impressed you the most and which has seemed needing the most work?#ntk — Braves In Burgundy (@BravesnBurgundy) August 6, 2017\n\nOn the up side, I would say the safeties. D.J. Swearinger has been impressive in both his play and his leadership. He will be a major upgrade. Su’a Cravens is still learning but he is getting better by the day. Will Blackmon has made some plays in practice and he will be a solid backup at either safety spot.\n\nI have yet to be impressed by the defensive line. Perhaps this is by design as Jim Tomsula doesn’t have a depth chart and players are moving all over the line and playing against the first-, second-, and third-team offenses. It’s just hard to get any sort of feel for who is capable of doing what. This should start to sort itself out beginning tomorrow but for now it’s hard to make any sense of it.\n\nThat’s a very good question and we won’t know the answer until the regular season starts. Greg Manusky will keep his situational defensive schemes under wraps until Week 1. I’ve asked many players on defense a similar question and I get the same vague answer. Perhaps they don’t even know what Manusky will be dialing up in Week 1.\n\nThe best answer came some Su’a Cravens. “We’re not going to sit back and let the offense take their shot and hopefully we’re in the perfect defense,” he said. “We’re going to come after the quarterback, we’re going to get aggressive with receivers on the edges, and hopefully our talent is better than their talent.”\n\nStay up to date on the Redskins.

  "latent_6698": "Found in Books: The War Map\n\nToday a find that was, at least to me, completely unexpected. It was well hidden and I only happened to notice it because I was wondering, for some reason I don’t recall, what my book looked like underneath its dust jacket.\n\nHere’s the book in question: a fairly worn copy of Bertrand Russell’s A History of Western Philosophy. It’s the second British edition from 1947.\n\nI peeled off the dust jacket, to find a fairly bland gray hardcover underneath. I was very much surprised, though, when I noticed what was on the back of the dust jacket. I think it’s best to just show you:\n\n(You can click the image above to see a larger version.) Did you see that one coming? Apparently these dust jackets were printed on the unused backs of old maps. If you look carefully, you can even see the old folds of the map, although the printer did a good job hiding these in the folds of the dust jacket.\n\nTwo main towns featured on the map are Knittelfeld and Judenburg, as you can see in the picture above. Near the top of the map we also have Waidhofen an der Ybbs. This places the map in the eastern Austrian Alps. Since this seems to be the westernmost section of a larger map, I’m guessing the original map covered all of the Alps east of here. If you’d care to see things in context, I marked some of the locations found along the edges of the map on Google Maps here.\n\nGiven the year (1947) this book was printed, I can think of one reason why the British might have had maps of Austria lying around. Let’s zoom in on the map’s legend for a moment, shall we?\n\nHave a look at the top left corner:\n\n“Geographical Section, General Staff, No. 4346\n\nPublished by War Office, 1944”\n\nThe War Office was the precursor of the British Ministry of Defense and the reason this map was created isn’t hard to guess. In 1944-45, the Allied forces were busily taking back Austria from the Germans. This map was perhaps printed to aid ground troops having to make their way through the mountainous terrain of the Alps.\n\nThis particular map was probably never used. It was presumably left over after the war, and the printer had them lying around or bought them cheaply and then reused them to print dust jackets. The size of the map happens to lend it fairly well for that purpose and the folds in the map happened to be just in the right places to hide them in the dust jacket’s folds. Still, it’s a really neat little piece of history!\n\nI’ve never seen this before and I couldn’t find any other instances of maps on the backs of dust jackets reported anywhere. If you’ve seen this sort of thing elsewhere, I’d love to hear about it, so let me know!",

(Photo by Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images for Samsung)\"\n\nPhotography by Jonathan Leibson/Getty Images\n\nSadly, The Strokes didn’t debut any new material at South by Southwest. Instead, the New York City outfit used their Friday night headlining set at Samsung’s Galaxy Fest to simply pummel the drunken crowd of rambunctious techies with an hour of early oughts nostalgia. Hell, they tossed out so many crowd favorites that diehards might have asked, “Is this hit?”\n\nFrontman Julian Casablancas was as wry and distant as ever, oscillating back and forth across the neon-drenched stage as a looming shadow. Between songs, he humorously scat a few lines from the Red Hot Chili Peppers’ single “Can’t Stop”, later feeding into the crowd’s post-encore rage (“One! More! Song!”) by insisting they’d play three, instead.\n\nLet’s not forget that The Strokes just closed out this past year’s ACL, and that setlist featured all of Friday night’s offerings. So seeing them return to the Texas capital was curious, but the crowd nevertheless ate it up. Who wouldn’t? It was an intimate club show with floors that lit up under the audience, seemingly recalling their iconic MTV 2$ Bill gig from 2002.\n\nNo, it was one hell of a rock ‘n’ roll soiree. (Dan Auerbach’s The Arcs served as the night’s openers, only this idiot writer was stuck waiting in line for the fire marshall to free up some space.)

  "latent_6736": "More than 200 business people have lent their support to the “Yes Scotland” campaign in an open letter published in The Herald Scotland newspaper, just one day after 130 slammed the idea of secession from the UK.\n\nThe heads of 200 companies representing about 10 percent of Scotland’s workforce have backed Scottish independence over staying with the UK. Similar to the pro-unity bloc’s letter on Wednesday, all the bosses signed on an individual basis, not as representatives of their companies.\n\n\"We are involved in business and entrepreneurship at different levels in Scotland and around the world. We believe independence is in the best interests of Scotland's economy and its people,” the letter reads.\n\nWealth and entrepreneurship will blossom in Scotland once power and resources are centralized in Edinburgh and not London, the pro-independence business leaders wrote, hoping to tip the balance of economic power.\n\n\"It will encourage a culture in which innovation, endeavor and enterprise are nurtured. It will place power in the hands of Scotland's people to channel the huge resources of our country in the interests of those who live and work here,” the letter states.\n\n\"The London-centricity of Britain's economy is unsustainable,\" wrote Professor Nathu Puri, founder of Purico, a UK-based industrial manufacturing company with strong ties to India.\n\n\"We must re-industrialize the nations and regions outside of the South East of England,\" Puri said.\n\nIn total, the ‘Yes’ campaign says that over 2,500 businesspeople have joined the pro-independence Business for Scotland organization, with membership coming from large corporations to smaller, family-owned businesses.\n\nTony Banks, the chairman of the group, calls the demographic the “lifeblood” of Scotland’s economy.\n\n\"More and more business people are moving to ‘Yes’ after looking at the facts and figures. Our members know Scotland's balance sheet is relatively stronger than the UK's but we have the potential to be stronger. We know Scotland will thrive as an independent country, because key economic decisions will be made by those who truly understand and care most about our Scotland's distinctive economic needs, that's the people who live and work here,” Banks said.\n\nUK Prime Minister David Cameron expected to give a speech later on Thursday which will focus on the connectedness of the Scottish economy to England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. Cameron will say that in some industries, Scottish companies source 90 percent of their customers from the UK. According to Cameron, trade between the UK and Scotland supports 1 million Scottish jobs, or about 20 percent of the population.\n\nLeading signatories are Sir Brian Souter, chairman of Stagecoach, an Australian-based transport giant, Jim McColl, chairman and CEO of Clyde Blowers, a £1 billion engineering group, and Ralph Topping, former CEO of gambling site William Hill.\n\nOn Wednesday, about 130 pro-UK business leaders signed an open letter stating their case to keep Scotland a part of the Union, and not seek independence.\n\nThe letter argued that Scotland’s business success is directly correlated to its integration with the UK economy, which is more than 10 times bigger than the Scottish economy of $250 billion.\n\nThe letter argued that Scotland’s recent success, record growth in investment and high employment are both connected to integration with the UK, and that separation would put progress at risk.",

  "latent_6973": "At Tuesday’s Women20 Summit, Ivanka Trump sat alongside some of the most powerful women in the world, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Christine Lagarde. But unlike those she joined on the panel, she had little to offer for women’s empowerment but platitudes.\n\nIvanka was personally invited to the G20 summit for women’s economic empowerment by Chancellor Merkel after their meeting at the White House in March, and it is her first trip abroad in an official capacity for the administration as Advisor to the President. She was meant to represent the voice of women’s empowerment for the Trump administration. When asked about what the role of First Daughter actually meant, since it was not familiar to the largely German audience, she said she didn’t know either and was learning.\n\nThe most exciting moment of the panel came during the first set of questions, when moderator Miriam Meckel pressed Ivanka on whether she was attending to advance the interests of her country or her business. The audience hissed as she claimed her father was a tremendous supporter of families and supported empowering women, pointing to his treatment of women in the private sector within his own organization rather than any real policies.\n\nBefore arriving at the summit, Ivanka wrote an op-ed in the Financial Times on Monday alongside the President of the World Bank Jim Yong Kim. In their op-ed, they discuss the importance of greater inclusion of women in formal economies (paid employment, access to financial services like banks, etc.) as well as boosting women’s entrepreneurship. But despite the polished op-ed, which praised the World Bank and simultaneously ignored that her father’s proposed budget cuts millions of dollars for the institution, the discussion on Wednesday lacked a serious understanding of power itself.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCanadian Minister of Foreign Affairs Chrystia Freeland was one of the few at the summit who discussed the difficulty of addressing social norms that lead to women’s lack of power changing family dynamics. Freeland touched on a deeper understanding of structures of power that constrain women’s economic opportunities.\n\nBut Ivanka pushed the narrative of the Trump administration: a narrative of individualized empowerment, which does not require deconstructing any of the underlying conditions that have led to the economic inequality faced by women today. If any woman can succeed if she only tries hard enough, the administration can justify maintaining the structures and norms that are persistently holding women back. The administration can say it is fighting for women’s rights through tokens like sending an ill-equipped Advisor to the President to sit on a panel, while simultaneously dismantling the social safety net that women and families need for their economic security.\n\nTrump’s proposed budget threatens to cut programs that would help women get off the ground in starting their own businesses in the first place. The proposed elimination of the Program for Investment in Micro-entrepreneurs (PRIME), at the Small Business Administration, for example, directly impacts the entrepreneurship Ivanka repeatedly stressed at the summit. Since women’s businesses tend to be smaller due to the industries they work in and the smaller levels of capital they start out with, they are among the microentrepreneurs who would be the very targets of scaling up through the PRIME program. PRIME provides grants for organizations that provide funding and services to help these nascent entrepreneurs get more capital and accelerate their businesses.\n\nThe administration also continues its attack on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau that was developed by the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 1071 of Dodd-Frank requires banks to collect demographic data on small business lending to understand the discrimination that affects women and racial and ethnic minorities in financial services. Consumer protection is also generally important to people starting and maintaining small businesses who often rely on consumer lending to start up their businesses and maintain cash flow. In his attacks on the CFPB, Trump has made it clear that discrimination against women in financial services simply isn’t a priority.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBroader attempts to overturn the Affordable Care Act and defund Planned Parenthood are perhaps the most concerning of all, as they would reduce women’s ability to plan for their families and careers, which is necessary in being able to take the risk of starting a business or invest in one’s career.\n\nIvanka Trump also spoke of the need for paid leave and affordable quality childcare as crucial for women’s economic empowerment, but then described these as “family issues.” This attitude, and this careful type of rhetoric, helps justify proposals that would mostly help families like Ivanka’s and provide negligible benefit to Trump’s working class supporters.\n\nRecent analysis by the Center for American Progress found that families in Ivanka’s former zip code in New York City would receive a tax benefit over a thousand times greater than in the Midwestern and Appalachian areas the swung strongly toward Trump in the recent election. Republican proposals that have been floating around as ways to provide paid leave, like comp time, would likewise benefit working class families less, who are already struggling to make ends meet without the ability to work extra time to bank hours that they may or may not be able to use to cover caretaking needs in the future.\n\nIvanka’s claims that women’s empowerment is good for economic growth and sustainability is true. But in practice, the Trump administration is only giving women tokens of support, while those that have the economic stability that Ivanka’s family enjoys see most of the benefits.\n\nKate Bahn is an Economist at the Center for American Progress.

  "latent_7014": "NHL.com continues its preview of the 2014-15 season, which will include in-depth looks at all 30 teams throughout September.\n\nIt was Justin Williams ' turn to speak during the Los Angeles Kings' Stanley Cup rally at Staples Center, three days removed from a second NHL championship in three seasons. Bob Miller, the Kings' play-by-play man, summoned Williams to the podium with a rousing introduction that featured several nicknames for the Conn Smythe Trophy winner.\n\nHowever, one of them didn't sit well with Williams.\n\n\"I hate that 'Mr. Game 7' nickname. I can't stand it,\" he said to the crowd with a sheepish smile.\n\nThree months later, does he still hate it?\n\n\"Yeah, absolutely,\" Williams said during the NHL Player Media Tour. \"I hate it because they kind of postered me up as a Game 7 guy, but our team's success has let me be successful in those games.\"\n\nWith Williams' work in Game 7s -- a 7-0 record, seven goals, a League-record 14 points -- the moniker is more than fitting. But that's generally how it goes with the 32-year-old forward. Try to single him out with praise and he'll find a way to deflect it to those around him, whether it's his teammates, coach, general manager, family, or those who won the Conn Smythe before him.\n\n\"It's such a trophy that oozes history and you look at the names on it, it's pretty surreal knowing you're going to be in company with those guys and your name is going to be on it,\" Williams said. \"You're going to be a part of history. That's very special and very humbling for me.\"\n\nVideo: Williams shows up for big games in 2014 playoffs\n\nHaving been individually recognized on the biggest stage in hockey, the Stanley Cup Playoffs, Williams said he doesn't think he will be a focus of opponents this season.\n\n\"I think the depth on our team kind of deters other teams from targeting anybody,\" he said, again taking the attention off himself. \"Because we have lines who could score, I think that's a big part of why we've been successful the past few years. Because we have stability within the lines and we have contributions from everyone.\"\n\nBefore \"Mr. Game 7\" and playoff MVP, Williams had a different label: injury-prone. A first-round pick (No. 28) by the Philadelphia Flyers in 2000 who jumped to the NHL from juniors as a 19-year-old, he missed time with a torn ACL and MCL (twice), a broken hand, a broken leg, a torn Achilles tendon and a dislocated shoulder, among other injuries.\n\n\"As a hockey player, you don't want to be labeled because that will follow you everywhere,\" said Williams, who hasn't a missed a game during the past three seasons. \"I've been able to stay healthy the last few years and a lot of that comes from knowing your body, preparing the right way and knowing what you can and can't do on the ice that's going to get you into vulnerable positions.\"\n\nWhen Williams has been healthy, he's been effective, and a winner. After 3 1/2 rocky seasons in Philadelphia, he was traded to the Carolina Hurricanes for Danny Markov in January 2004. In 2005-06, his first full season with the Hurricanes and the first in which he played all 82 games, he had 31 goals, 45 assists and 76 points to help lead Carolina to its first Stanley Cup title. After another full season in 2006-07, when Williams scored a career-high 33 goals, his career stalled because of some of the injuries.\n\nEnter Kings general manager Dean Lombardi, who acquired Williams prior to the 2009 NHL Trade Deadline and took a fair amount of criticism for doing so. Williams said Lombardi wanting him in L.A. boosted him at a time when he sorely needed it.\n\n\"We've had many conversations. He's really helped instill a confidence back in my abilities and my game and I'm thankful for that,\" Williams said.\n\nFor a while, though, it looked like the critics might be right. Williams, who was on injured reserve when he was traded to the Kings, played 49 games the next season in 2009-10, limited by a broken leg, and was a healthy scratch in three games of their six-game, first-round loss to the Vancouver Canucks.\n\nFrom that low point, Williams rewrote the script in Hollywood by staying healthy and becoming the key contributor on a championship team that Lombardi envisioned he could be. In the Kings' dominant 20-game run to their first Cup championship in 2012, Williams had four goals, 11 assists and was plus-8. In the 2013 postseason that ended in a Western Conference Final loss to the Chicago Blackhawks, he had six goals (two game-winners) and three assists in 18 games. His 2014 playoff performance -- nine goals (two game-winners), 16 assists and plus-13 -- cemented him as a bona fide star and three-time Cup-winner.\n\nIt is a journey that started in his hometown of Cobourg, Ontario. His father, Craig, and mother, Denise, were typical hockey parents, taking Justin \"wherever I needed to go\" while maintaining careers in sales and accounting, respectively. When Williams was young, his older sister and \"No. 1 fan\" Nikki had a ritual before his games.\n\n\"She had this song, the 'Unbelievable' song (by EMF), 'You're un-be-liev-able!'\" Williams said. \"She always used to make me listen to about 10 seconds of it before I went out there and she was like, 'Go get 'em.'\"\n\nWilliams' family was on full display after the Kings' Cup triumph against the New York Rangers in June. He conducted his Conn Smythe press conference with 5-year-old son Jaxon on his lap, sharing the spotlight again in his finest hour.\n\n\"You don't get to this level by chance, you have to have a lot of family support,\" he said. \"I'm the player I am and the person I am because of the upbringing I had and the support I had.\"\n\nThat support extends to his Kings teammates. They return for the 2014-15 season mostly intact, sparking talk of a repeat, but as a player who has had his share of ups and downs, Williams takes his usual humble and practical approach.\n\n\"Once you attain a goal, set another goal for yourself,\" Williams said. \"My goal was making the NHL, after that it was being an impact player in the NHL, after that it was winning a Stanley Cup, after that it was winning another one. I don't know how good our team can be, how many more Cups we could win, but I hope we could win more. I just want to keep winning and play as long as I'm effective and have that drive. \"\n\nWilliams said cashing in on perhaps one last big payday is not on his mind as he enters the final year of his contract.\n\n\"Not yet, not whatsoever,\" Williams said. \"Nothing is going to deter me from playing the way I'm going to play. You just have a little bit extra added incentive knowing that this is your contract year, as everyone does. I'm going to do the best I can for myself and my family.\"",

  "latent_7104": "The University of California Student Association has passed a resolution calling on the university to divest itself from several world governments … including its own.\n\nThe UCSA considered two divestment resolutions during a meeting at UCLA on Sunday. One of them requested that the UC system divest itself of government bonds issued by the United States, as well as several other countries including Mexico, Russia, Brazil, Egypt, Turkey and even Sri Lanka. The other told the university to divest from several companies that do business with Israel.\n\nEach resolution passed the student board by a final vote of 9-1, with six members abstaining.\n\nThe resolution offered a host of justifications for divesting from the U.S. government, drawn from both foreign and domestic policies:\n\nWHEREAS, The government of the United States of America is engaged in drone strikes that have killed over 2,400 people in Pakistan and Yemen, many of them civilians. The government oversees, by far, the highest rate of imprisonment in the world, and racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately targeted by law enforcement agencies, particularly for drug­ related offences. 400,000 undocumented immigrants are held in detention centers every year, and millions have been deported since the current Administration took office, and the government is directly supporting and propping up numerous dictatorships around the world with weapons sales and foreign aid.\n\nThe justification for each of the other boycotted countries was similar. Russia was condemned for its occupation of the Crimea, Brazil for its poor labor conditions and Turkey even took flak for the long-standing presence of Turkish settlers in northern Cyprus. Naturally, the Israeli divestment resolution was based on Israel’s treatment of Palestinians and the ongoing presence of settlers in the West Bank.\n\nMiri Kornfeld, a UCLA graduate and the high school program director with StandWithUs, a pro-Israel organization, said that despite a lengthy floor debate between supporters and opponents of the resolutions, the UCSA board was stacked so there was no chance of blocking the resolutions.\n\n“We had walked into the room and we had already lost,” she told The Daily Caller News Foundation. She also said that the overall intent of UCSA in advocating divestment from its own country was baffling to her.\n\n“The UC system is funded by California, and California is funded by the United States. I’m kind of confused about where they think the UC system’s funding is going to come from.”\n\nUCSA’s anti-Israel resolution invited a counter-protest, as dozens of pro-Israel students walked out of the meeting and then assembled outside to wave Israeli and American flags.\n\nAt the conservative blog Legal Insurrection, Cornell law professor William Jacobson offered an odd sort of praise for UCSA’s action, noting that at least critics of Israel were finally looking at other countries as well.\n\n“The U. Cal. student government has proven a point I’ve made repeatedly in terms of the academic boycott: If you are going to boycott Israel, then you need to apply those standards to the whole world, which will result in boycotting yourselves,” said Jacobson.\n\nFollow Blake on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

  "latent_7161": "Now that Evolve has launched last week, the other major console release of the month is The Order: 1886, the Sony PS4 exclusive developed by Ready at Dawn and SCE Santa Monica, who between them have been responsible for PlayStation’s famed God of War series over the years.\n\nNaturally, it wouldn’t be a major game release without some sort of controversy, and the issue this time is an old one, a debate about game length that was sparked by a YouTuber uploading what he claims is the entire game online, which clocks in at just over five and a half hours, including the game’s lengthy integrated cutscenes.\n\nThis weekend brought us an impassioned defense of The Order by Ready at Dawn CEO Ru Weerasuriya, as told through Eurogamer, in response to the concerns about playtime.\n\n\"I know there are numbers out there,\" he said. \"I know why the question comes up. I know numbers have been put out there that are actually not right. It's impossible to finish the game in that time, so we know the numbers are wrong.”\n\nWhile Weerasuriya says the YouTube playthrough time is incorrect, he does not offer a counter in the form of an average playtime through their own testing, but instead uses the opportunity to talk about why it’s alright if shorter games exist, given the wide scope the market today.\n\n\"Do we all need to do the same thing?” he asks. “I hope people who do like these kind of games, do play them. But I also want to be in an industry where me as a gamer, I'm given the choice to do that. I've played games that lasted two hours that were better than games that I played for 16 hours. That's the reality of it.”\n\nThe Order: 1886 is coming under fire for this issue in particular due to the nature of the game. Weerasuriya cites Modern Warfare as having a short campaign he loved, but that game came with a multiplayer mode that accounts for dozens, if not hundreds more hours of playtime. The Order has no such mode, nor does it seem to have a New Game+ option where players can replay the story with a host of upgrades acquired through an initial playthrough. That means however long the story is, it’s unlikely there will be much replayability past the original length, and no additional gameplay time is added through multiplayer.\n\nAnd the“two hour games that are better than 16 hour games” that Weerasuriya references almost assuredly weren't sold for $60. Many indie games boast very short lengths, but are often a third or a quarter or less of the price of a new AAA blockbuster like The Order.\n\nSo, assuming the five and a half hour playtime is wrong, and it’s more along the lines of seven or eight hours, does that make The Order a bad deal? That’s a complicated question, and this is a debate that’s been raging in the video game space for years now. Is “entertainment dollars per hour” an appropriate metric by which to judge a game?\n\nRecently, I've found myself on the other side of the fence, criticizing games for being too sprawling and filled with fluff. Last year I took aim at two of 2014’s biggest games, Far Cry 4 and Dragon Age: Inquisition, the latter of which was recognized by most major outlets as Game of the Year.\n\nFar Cry 4 was a solid game that seemed determined to artificially extend its playtime by inserting side-quest after side-quest, and minigame after minigame. In my detailed breakdown of the game’s activities, given all the stuff you could do in a playthrough, maybe three hours were devoted to the actual, core story missions of the game, while you could spend another sixty hours easily completing every non-plot related minigame and sub-mission out there. It felt as if the game may have reached the Ubisoft breaking point of being almost entirely made up of side-quests.\n\nDragon Age was a different story, a game that did have a hefty central storyline, and side-quests that were often more than just glorified minigames. And yet, the game was so long, that when I said I sunk 40 hours into it and was exhausted because I didn't feel like I was anywhere near completion, fans told me I just wasn't dedicated enough, and everyone knows that you had to play the game for 80-100 hours to really be able to judge it fairly.\n\nAll this is to say that I believe that games can actually be hindered by being too long, as the “value” you receive for “dollars per hour” is outweighed by the game feeling artificially bloated and being borderline impossible to complete for those with family/work/school responsibilities. Games like Dragon Age and Far Cry now make you grind out hours of side quests in order to be powerful enough to progress in the main story. Others like Destiny have a story that can be beaten in probably five or six hours, but players will spend hundreds more playing the same Strikes and Raids on repeat. It’s “content” without really being content.\n\nYes, this is technically a good value, given that for Far Cry and Dragon Age I’m paying roughly $1/hr for my entertainment buck, with Destiny probably being closer to $0.30, given how much time I’ve sunk into it. And yet, do I dislike other games because they've given me shorter experiences? Absolutely not.\n\nWolfenstein: The New Order, Shadow of Mordor, BioShock Infinite and The Last of Us have all been dramatically shorter than the aforementioned games, ranging from probably 10-15 hours with not much replayability to them, if any. And yet, they've been some of my favorite titles of the last few years regardless, because of how well their campaigns were designed, or how well their stories were told. I don’t regret paying full retail for any of them, even if they didn't give me sixty hours of side-quests to pad out my experience.\n\nAnd yet, is there a downward limit? Despite what I've said above, yes, absolutely there is. There has to be.\n\nDespite the story-based games I mentioned being “shorter,” I don’t think a one of them is under ten hours, unless you’re doing a speed run. To me, ten hours seems to be about the minimum appropriate length for a campaign or story mode in a $60 game not attached to an overwhelmingly attractive multiplayer experience like you’d find in Halo or Call of Duty. I seem to remember completing most God of War games, for example, in about 10-12 hours. Even a game like Telltale's Walking Dead has a five-episode story that ends up being about 8-10 hours by the end, yet that game sold new for $25.\n\nBut if The Order is 6-8 hours, and a lot of that is lengthy cutscenes (albeit interactive ones), I can see why that might rub some players the wrong way, in much the same way that Evolve as a multiplayer-only title is having trouble convincing some it's worth a full $60 while lacking a campaign mode. It’s the opposite problem, but a similar issue. Evolve, however, can boast hours and hours or replayability if players like the core game, while The Order likely cannot.\n\nKyle Orland wrote a great defense of shorter games for Gamasutra back in 2010, when some critics were questioning the length of Limbo, which most could beat in about four hours. Since then, we've seen this come up again with Gone Home, a two hour “experience” some were hesitant to classify as a game, but others viewed as one of the best games of the year. As recently as a few months ago, Polygon's Ben Kutchera wrote a column about his love of short games as a busy parent, citing The Vanishing of Ethan Carter as an example, which clocks in at about five hours of gameplay.\n\nBut the common thread? Again, all three of those games, and most other truly “short” games are indies, sold usually from $10-20. I think saying that “people who think short games suck are wrong” is something of a straw man argument. Probably everyone has had a good short gaming experience at some point or another, or at least recognizes that it’s possible. But there is a difference between $15 for four hours of Limbo and $60 for six hours of The Order: 1886. A reviewer can advise a fan to \"wait for a sale\" to pick up a short game if price is a factor, but obviously the dev wants to sell their game for the full $60 to as many customers as possible, and \"waiting for a sale\" often means \"buying used,\" which does nothing at all for those who made the game.\n\nThere isn’t some magic formula that can deduce exactly how long a game has to be at minimum to be worth the cost. You can use analogies to (clearly overpriced) movie tickets if you want, but that’s an imperfect system at best. And in fact, Ready at Dawn uses movies as the opposite side of the argument in the Eurogamer interview, saying that length alone doesn't signify quality in film. \"Just because a movie is three hours long, it doesn't make it better,\" Weerasuriya says.\n\nThat's true, but while a ninety minute movie costs as much as a three hour one, there is still a downward limit. If theaters and studios started charging $12 a ticket for a 45 minute feature, you can bet that there would be pushback, so much so that only rarely will you ever see a movie released that clocks in under an hour twenty or so. Short films may have their own Oscar category, and no one is denying their quality, but no one is paying $12 each to see them either.\n\nIt does seem plausible that The Order: 1886 may be scraping the bottom when it comes to the minimum accepted length for a $60 game if these campaign length guesses are anywhere close to accurate. The fact that Ready at Dawn didn't counter with specifics that show the YouTuber is outright lying, and the game is really 10-15 hours, says that the five and a half hour estimate is probably not all that far off. Even with the benefit of the doubt and assuming somehow there’s an extra two hours in the game the YouTuber cut out, it’s still a tricky proposition to charge $60 for that.\n\nAs a result, The Order: 1886 has to simply be amazing. What is true about shorter games, is that the less time you spend with them, the better they have to be. Gone Home, Limbo, Portal and others packed a hell of a lot of brilliance into just a few hours. The Order will have to do just that or else it simply can’t even begin to make the argument that it’s worth the price. That $60 will have to be seen in the quality of the visuals, story, voice acting, and gameplay, if the actual physical content isn't there. But the shorter the game, the better all those aspects will have to be in order to make it seem worthwhile.\n\nThe Order’s review embargo lifts on Thursday, the 19th, with the game’s release on Friday, the 20th, so we should know a lot more about where the game stands by the end of the week. But for now, despite the fact that “dollars per hour” is a flawed metric of quality, The Order does raise a few important questions about what justifies a $60 price point.\n\nUpdate: Read Erik's thoughts about the issue, where he says that the game easily takes more than five hours if you take your time.\n\nFollow me on Twitter, like my page on Facebook, and pick up a copy of my sci-fi novel, The Last Exodus, and its sequel, The Exiled Earthborn, along with my new Forbes book, Fanboy Wars.\n\nWatch below to see when Call of Duty may return to World War II:",
  "latent_7185": "A house in Dunbar, an area of the city that has seen rapid price increases for single-family homes | Rob Kruyt\n\nVancouver economists have come up with some policy ideas to curb the city’s runaway home prices — but it’s questionable whether there is any political appetite to take them up.\n\nA team of nine academics from the University of British Columbia (UBC) and Simon Fraser University (SFU) have proposed a 1.5% property tax surcharge, designed so that homeowners who live in the property and pay income taxes in British Columbia would be exempt. Read the full policy proposal here.\n\nFor example, the owners of a $1 million home would pay a $15,000 surcharge, but if they had paid $15,000 or more in income taxes to Canada Revenue Agency that year, the surcharge would be zero. If they paid $10,000 in taxes, their property surcharge would be $5,000. Veterans, disabled people, and Canadians of retirement age would be exempt.\n\nAlong with cities such as New York, London and Sydney, Vancouver has become an attractive place for wealthy people from emerging economy countries to “park” their money in real estate, especially during periods of economic or political turmoil.\n\nThe policy authors envision a system where the revenue from what they have named the BC Housing Affordability Fund (BCHAF) property surcharge would be redistributed as lump-sum payments to Canadian tax filers in a designated area. However, the policy would also work if the tax revenue was returned to government.\n\nBased on vacancy data, the report authors think around $90 million per year could be raised in Vancouver.\n\n“There’s a lot of good things you could do with the revenue and we don’t have a particularly strong stand on that as long as it’s used to somehow benefit people who are struggling with prices,” said Tom Davidoff, a professor at UBC’s Sauder School of Business and one of the authors of the report.\n\nThe surcharge could be applied to specific geographical areas to address, for instance, the much higher property prices in Vancouver compared with rural areas of the province. It would also provide a currently unavailable data set on which homeowners make their income in Canada and how many properties are vacant.\n\nIf property owners were allowed to offset their surcharge with rental revenue reported to the Canada Revenue Agency, the policy would be an incentive to rent out housing instead of leaving it vacant.\n\nThe policy would be enforceable, Davidoff said: the same penalties for not paying the current property tax would apply.\n\nIn a January 12 Vancouver Sun op-ed, Rhys Kesselman, a professor of economics at SFU, proposed a progressive property surtax on homes worth over a certain amount, such as $1 million. Kesselman’s proposal would have the taxation revenues funnelled back into municipal governments for affordable housing initiatives.\n\nLike Davidoff’s proposal, Kesselman believes the surtax could be modified for different real estate markets across the province. He also suggests homeowners could credit their B.C. income tax against the property tax surcharge.\n\nDavidoff said it would be “terrific” if both policies were applied. However, there is little interest from the current B.C. government in intervening in the real estate market.\n\n“I think they’ve been pretty clear that the thing that they value is making sure there’s more home equity for people who own houses,” he said.\n\nDavidoff is critical of the B.C. government’s first-time home buyer’s grant, which allows qualifying buyers to pay less or no property transfer tax. The measure provides no relief to renters, he said, and pushes home prices higher by increasing the demand for housing.\n\nDemand to immigrate to B.C. is high and Davidoff doesn’t believe the BCHAF would deter new immigrants with capital to invest.\n\n“We think this satisfies the [BC] Liberals’ demand that this not adversely affect property values.”\n\njstdenis@biv.com\n\n@jenstden",

Though I’m sure those are exactly the reasons why it will be understandable.\n\nCross-Functional Science\n\nAgile software development often addresses the problem of organizational silos, or the concept of separating people who are doing different kinds of work, claiming that this often negatively impacts the performance of an organization. Interestingly enough, a similar situation has existed in science for many decades.\n\nMost universities and research institutes are organized in scientific silos. Physicists work with physicists, biologists with biologists, and mathematicians with mathematicians. This has led to scientific fragmentation and tunnel vision among scientists and researchers. The different scientific disciplines are so isolated from each other that they usually don’t know what the others are doing [Waldrop 1992:61].\n\nScientific silos can be a problem, because many phenomena in the world, across different scientific disciplines, are very similar to each other. For example, economists were baffled in the past by a phenomenon known as \"local equilibriums,\" which happened to be something that physicists were already very familiar with at the time [Waldrop 1992:139]. And phase transitions in physics look suspiciously similar to punctuated equilibriums in biology. And biologists have noticed that mathematics can help them analyze ecologies of species [Gleick 1987:59]. And \"discoveries\" made by mathematicians turned out to have been discovered years earlier by meteorologists. [Gleick 1987:31].\n\nFor many decades, scientists in different disciplines have struggled with complex phenomena that they could not explain. But when the dots were connected between the sciences, and systems across all disciplines were understood to be complex systems, suddenly things began to make more sense. In fact, I once read the suggestion that the biggest leaps in science happened when scientists worked in fields they were unfamiliar with, because they brought with them the knowledge and experience (and fights and failures) of another field that they were familiar with!\n\nLike agile software development, complex systems theory favors a cross-disciplinary approach to problem solving. Complexity thinking is the antidote to specialization in science. It recognizes patterns in systems across all scientific disciplines, and promotes problem-solving involving concepts from different fields. But complexity theory has not been the first attempt at cross-breeding the sciences. Let’s have a brief look at history to see what happened before.\n\nGeneral Systems Theory\n\nIn the late 1940s, a number of scientists and researchers, led by biologist Ludwig von Bertalanffy, created an area of study called general systems theory (sometimes simply called systems theory). Their studies were based on the idea that most phenomena in the universe can be viewed as webs of relationships among elements. And no matter whether their nature is biological, chemical, or social, these systems have common patterns and behaviors that can be studied to develop greater insight into systems in general. The grand goal of systems theory was to form a unity of science that was interdisciplinary: a common language of systems across all sciences.\n\nOne of the achievements of systems theory, which continued to be studied and expanded until at least the 1970s, was shifting the focus from elements in a system to the organization of elements, thereby recognizing that relationships among elements are dynamic, not static. Scientists studied concepts like autopoiesis (how a system constructs itself), identity (how a system is identifiable), homeostasis (how a system remains stable), and permeability (how a system interacts with its environment). [Mitchell 2009:297].\n\nThe recognition that a software development team can construct itself, that it can define its own identity, that it needs to interact with its environment, and that interactions among team members are just as important as the team members themselves (or even more so) can all be attributed to general systems theory.\n\nRegrettably, the unification was never fully achieved, which should come as no surprise to software developers with experience in attempts at unification. But the legacy of general systems theory is significant. Almost all laws for system theory also turn out to be valid for complex systems [Richardson 2004a:75], which is more than various unification frameworks in software engineering have achieved.\n\nCybernetics\n\nAround the time when general systems theory was conceptualized by biologists, psychologists, economists, and other researchers, a similar area of study called cybernetics was created by a similarly diverse group of neurophysiologists, psychiatrists, anthropologists, and engineers, with mathematician Norbert Wiener as a leading figure.\n\nCybernetics is the study of regulatory systems that have goals and interact with their environment through feedback mechanisms. The goal of cybernetics itself is to understand the processes in such regulatory systems, which include iterations of acting (having an effect on the environment), sensing (checking the response of the environment), evaluating (comparing the current state with the system’s goal), and back again to acting. This circular process is a fundamental concept in the study of cybernetics.\n\nFrom cybernetics, we have adopted the view that a software team is a goal-directed system that regulates itself using various feedback cycles. We have learned that in a self-regulating system like a software team, rather than energy and force, it is information, communication, and purpose that are the most important factors. And cybernetics helped us understand that feedback plays a crucial role in the development of complex behavior [Mitchell 2009:296].\n\nGeneral systems theory and cybernetics are often confused. This is not surprising because they both influenced each other; they both have difficult names; they both tried to work toward a unified science for systems; and they both proved unable to live up to their original goals. Nevertheless, each is responsible for carrying the body of knowledge of systems, which later theories could benefit from and build upon.\n\nDynamical Systems Theory\n\nWhen we see systems theory and cybernetics as the two legs of the body of knowledge of systems, then one of its arms is certainly dynamical systems theory.\n\nGrown out of applied mathematics in the 1960’s, dynamical systems theory explains that dynamic systems have many states, some of which are stable and some of which are not. When parts of a system never change over time, or when they always settle back to original values after having been disturbed, we say that the stable states are acting as attractors.\n\nThe relevance of dynamical systems theory to software development is that it helps explain why some projects are stable and why others are not. And why sometimes it seems impossible to change an organization, because it always reverts back to its original behavior.\n\nDynamical systems theory played a pivotal role in later theories by offering mathematics as a helping hand when dealing with hard-to-measure concepts from systems theory and cybernetics. (And it is a comforting thought that part of what was to become complexity theory was not\n\nGame Theory\n\nIf we consider dynamical systems theory as one arm of the body of knowledge of systems, then game theory must certainly be the other one. Multiple systems often compete for the same resources, or try to have each other for lunch. Game theory indicates that, in such cases, systems may develop competing strategies.\n\nAs another branch of applied mathematics, game theory attempts to capture behavior of systems in strategic situations, where the success of one depends in part on the choices made by others. Game theory was developed in the 1930s, and introduced to biology and evolutionary theory in the 1970s when it was recognized that it applied to the strategies of organisms for catching prey, evading predators, protecting territories, and dating the other sex.\n\nGame theory has turned out to be an important tool in many fields, including economics, philosophy, anthropology, and political science. And of course software development, where it not only helps software developers to build games, electronic markets, and peer-to-peer systems, but also explains the behavior of people in teams, and the behavior of teams in organizations.\n\nEvolutionary Theory\n\nIt is hard to imagine anyone not being familiar with evolutionary theory, which became very well-known ever since Charles Darwin published The Origin of Species, one of the most famous books ever, in 1859. What virtually all biologists agree on are the basic concepts of evolution: gradual genetic changes in species, and survival of the fittest by natural selection.\n\nOf course, agreement on the basics doesn’t prevent biologists from bickering endlessly about the details. The importance of random genetic drift (species changing for no reason), punctuated equilibriums (sudden drastic changes instead of gradual change), selfish genes (selection at the gene level instead of organisms or groups), and horizontal gene transfer (species exchanging genes with each other) have all been discussed, embraced, and disputed vigorously [Mitchell 2009:81-87]. (But confront them with Intelligent Design and suddenly biologists are united in their rejection of such unscientific nonsense.)\n\nEvolutionary theory has contributed significantly to the study of all kinds of systems, whether they are biological, digital, economical, or sociological. It is said that teams, projects and products evolve, while adapting to their changing environments. And even though the kind of \"evolution\" in software systems is not the same as Darwin described, evolutionary thinking has helped in understanding growth, survival, and adaptation of systems over time. And this is why I consider evolutionary theory to be the brains of the body of knowledge of systems.\n\nChaos Theory\n\nThough a number of discoveries about chaos were made earlier, the real breakthrough of chaos theory happened in the 1970s and 80s, with Edward Lorenz and Benoit Mandelbrot being the leading figures at the time.\n\nChaos theory taught us that even the smallest changes in a dynamic system can have tremendous consequences at a later time. This means that the behavior of many systems is ultimately unpredictable, because minor issues can turn into big problems, as any software team is eager to acknowledge. This innate unpredictability of dynamic systems has far-reaching consequences for estimation, planning and control, which is a well-known concern among climate scientists and traffic experts, but less readily accepted among project managers and functional managers.\n\nAnother topic addressed by chaos theory was the discovery of fractals and scale invariance, which is the concept that the behavior of a system, when plotted in a graph, looks similar on all scales.\n\nChaos theory is seen by some as the predecessor to complexity theory, and shares with it an appreciation for uncertainty and change, which is why I like to see it as the heart of the body of knowledge of systems.\n\nThe Body of Knowledge of Systems\n\nThere is not a single definition of complexity, and there is not a single theory covering all complex systems [Lewin 1999:x]. Scientists have been looking for fundamental laws that are true for all systems for ages, but so far they have been unsuccessful.\n\nIt seems reasonable to ask - exactly what is this thing called \"complexity theory?\" For although there are many definitions of CT [complexity theory], it has been suggested, that there is no unified description. . [Wallis 2009:26]\n\nEach system is different, and lessons learned with past results are no guarantee of future performance. And so it appears that what we have is a collection of theories that are sometimes complementary, sometimes overlapping, and sometimes contradictory.\n\nFurthermore, there are plenty of smaller studies that, each in their own right, have brought significant contributions to the field of complex systems. We could call them the eyes, ears, fingers and toes of the body of knowledge. For example, the work on dissipative systems gave us insight into spontaneous pattern-forming, and how systems can self-organize within boundaries. The work on cellular automata taught us how complex behavior can result from simple rules. From the study of artificial life we learned how information processing works in agent-based systems. Thanks to learning classifier systems we came to understand how genetic algorithms enable living systems to be capable of adaptive learning. And thanks to developments in social network analysis we now understand how information propagates among people in a network.\n\nDespite the problem that the body parts don’t match properly in some places, and that the figure looks uglier than Freddy Krueger in a tutu, the body of knowledge of systems is alive and kicking (see Figure 1). And, when applied to complex systems, we call it complex systems theory.\n\nFigure 1 - The Body of Knowledge of systems.\n\nAre We Abusing Science?\n\nIn agile software development, we regularly hear references to scientific terms such as self-organization and emergence.\n\nAt the heart of complex adaptive systems theory’s relevance to software development is the concept of emergence, and the factors leading to emergent results. [Highsmith 1999]\n\nFor example, an ant colony, the brain, the immune system, a Scrum team, and New York City, are self-organizing systems. [Schwaber, Beedle 2002]\n\nScrum is not a methodology, a defined process or set of procedures. It’s an open development framework. The rules are constraints on behavior that cause a complex adaptive system to self-organize into an intelligent state. This is taken from Tom Hume’s blog entry about Jeff Sutherland’s presentation.\n\nIs it justified to apply complex systems theory to software development? Do the complexity scientists themselves agree that words like self-organization and emergence not only apply to ant hills, the brain, and the immune system, but also to agile teams?\n\nSome scientists have not so nice things to say about people like us borrowing their scientific terms. They say we use scientific terminology without bothering about what the words really mean. They say we import scientific concepts without any conceptual justification. And they say some of us are intoxicated with words, indifferent to what they actually mean [Sokal 1998:4].\n\nOK, I cheated a little. Sokal’s rant was not directed at agilists using (or abusing) complexity science, but at people in general. Still, the signal here is clear. To really hammer it in, here’s another quote that hits closer at home:\n\nNot unexpectedly, the complexity gurus are most upset with how complexity science terms are loosely, if not metaphorically, defined and tossed into our managerial discourse – one [guru] goes as far as to suggest that the book[s] offer many insights for managers, but one should simply black out all references to complexity science. [Maguire, McKelvey 1999:55]\n\nOuch!\n\nAlright, I cheated again. This rant was directed at management literature abusing terms from complexity science, not agile literature. But... we are warned.\n\nWe have to be careful when carrying over terms from complexity science to other disciplines, including management and software development. For example, when a small issue in a software project unexpectedly turns out to have big consequences, it is all too easy to say that this is typical \"chaotic\" behavior of the system. But, without really understanding what chaos actually means from a scientific viewpoint, we might be making ourselves the laughing stock among complexity scientists around the world…\n\nSo, is the term self-organizing team an example of abuse of science?\n\nAnd what about emergent design? Is that abuse of science as well?\n\nPersonally, I don’t think so. But it may be wise to remain critical and skeptical at all times.\n\nA New Era: Complexity Thinking\n\nWhen you apply complex systems theory to software development and management you are treating your organization as a system.\n\nThis is not new. System dynamics, originally developed in the 1950’s (and not to be confused with dynamical systems theory) is a technique developed to help managers understand and improve their industrial processes. System dynamics was one of the first techniques to be able to show how even seemingly simple organizations can have unexpected nonlinear behaviors [Stacey 2000a:64]. System dynamics recognized that the structure of an organization, with its many circular, interlocking, and sometimes time-delayed relationships between organizational parts, is often a more important contributor to an organization’s behavior than the individual parts themselves. System dynamics has helped managers to improve their understanding of business processes, while at the same time pointing out that the properties of an organization are often a result of the entire system, and cannot be traced back to individuals in the organization. System dynamics is not part of the body of knowledge of systems. Instead it is a tool, like a 60-year old calculator, to make the body of knowledge interesting for managers who like using numbers.\n\nA newer but similar technique is called systems thinking, developed in the 1980’s and popularized by Peter Senge’s book The Fifth Discipline [Senge 2006]. It is about understanding how things influence each other within a whole. Systems thinking is a problem-solving mindset that views \"problems\" as parts of an overall system. Instead of isolating individual parts, thereby potentially contributing to unintended consequences, it focuses on cyclical relationships and non-linear cause and effect within an organization. Systems thinking is very similar to system dynamics, though the latter typically uses actual simulations and calculations in an attempt to analyze the impact of alternative policies objectively. Systems thinking is said to be more subjective in its evaluation of complex structures, because it has no clear definition of usage [Forrester 1992]. Its main contribution is for people to concentrate on problematic systems instead of problematic people. I would say that systems thinking is like a 30-year old camera that is able to give managers a more complete picture of their organization, from various interesting but subjective angles.\n\nThe study of complexity in social systems is called social complexity. Unfortunately, neither system dynamics nor systems thinking recognize that social complexity cannot realistically be analyzed and adapted in a top-down fashion [Snowden 2005]. Simulating organizations with simplistic models, or drawing teams and people with bubbles and arrows, falsely suggests that managers can analyze their organization, modify it, and then steer it in the right direction. System dynamics and systems thinking recognize non-linearity, but they are still grounded in the idea that top management can somehow construct a \"right\" kind of organization that is able to produce the \"right\" kind of results. In their approach to applying the body of knowledge of systems to organizations they are little more than 19th century deterministic thinking in a 20th century jacket [Stacey 2000a]. The 21st century is the age of complexity. It is the century where managers realize that, in order to manage social complexity, they need to understand how things grow. Not how they are built.\n\nI wrote a book, called Management 3.0, which applies complex systems theory in a way that does not contradict its own message of non-linearity, non-determinism and uncertainty. My management 3.0 model applies complexity thinking. It assumes that managers cannot construct and steer a self-organizing team. Instead such a team must be grown and nurtured. It acknowledges that productive organizations are not managed with models and plans. Instead it must emerge through the power of self-organization and evolution. I like to see complexity thinking as the light which feeds all that grows. It is the energy source from which everything is derived and produced. Calculators and cameras are interesting. But they are useless without light.\n\nSummary\n\nComplexity science is a multi-disciplinary approach to research into systems, which builds on earlier achievements in the fields of general systems theory, cybernetics, dynamical systems theory, game theory, evolutionary theory, and game theory. Social complexity is the study of social groups as complex adaptive systems. And complexity thinking is about treating social groups as complex adaptive systems.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that findings in complexity science can be applied to social systems, like software development teams and management, though it is still unclear how far we can go in copying system concepts from one discipline to another. But at the very least, software teams, team leaders, and development managers can be inspired to solve their problems by looking at other kinds of complex systems. Because history proves that the greatest advancements are made when ideas from one field are adopted and adapted in another field.\n\nThis article is an adaptation from a text out of the book \"Management 3.0: Leading Agile Developers, Developing Agile Leaders,\" by Jurgen Appelo.

I keep thinking about all of those \"male enhancement\" remedies made from phallic-looking foods (and in some cases, actual animal phalluses). Science has pretty much come down and said those things just don't work. But in the case of the old adage of walnuts being brain food, well, whoever came up with that just may have been onto something.\n\nIt's really kind of zany how much a walnut half looks like a brain (albeit a nutty, crunchy, delicious brain!). The human brain is made up of about 60% of what is called \"structural fat\" and needs high-quality fats like omega-3s to function properly by keeping the brain fluid and flexible. Walnuts are loaded with omega-3s, which make them the ultimate \"brain food.\"\n\nSome studies have linked low consumption of omega-3s to depression and decreased cognitive function. So making walnuts part of your diet (in moderation, of course) could be a good way boost your spirits as well as your IQ.\n\nWe all need sleep to stay sane. Did you know that walnuts also seem to triple melatonin levels in the body? Melatonin is one of the body's sleep regulating hormones, so if you're tired of counting sheep at night, maybe a pre-bedtime snack of walnuts would help you get some shuteye.\n\nWalnuts also contain manganese, copper, iron, phosphorous, magnesium, and calcium—all nutrients which are important to good health, and walnuts, like most nuts, can help lower cholesterol and improve heart health when eaten as part of a balanced diet.\n\nMost of the walnuts we consume in our diets are in sweets or baked goods. I recently made a delicious, simple pesto sauce for pasta using walnuts and mix of green herbs (I forgot to buy the pine nuts and the supermarket was low on basil).

When asked by Senator Al Franken of Minnesota if Sessions had any contact with Russia during the presidential campaign last year, Sessions categorically denied it. However, an explosive Washington Post story has indicated that Sessions had contact at least twice with a Russian ambassador.\n\nWhile Sessions now is trying to make a case that he was meeting with the Russians not as part of Trump’s campaign, but in his duties on the Senate Armed Forces Committee, many politicians on both sides of the aisle are lining up to demand either an outright resignation, or at the very least that the Attorney General recuse himself from the ongoing investigation into Russian tampering with the election last year.\n\nThe stress and pressure of the scandal have “finally gotten” to Mr Sessions, his aides tell us, and yesterday he turned to marijuana to alleviate that stress. Coming out of the DOJ headquarters, Sessions allegedly saw a man smoking a joint. Instead of harassing him about the marijuana as one might have presumed, Attorney General Sessions asked the man if he could share the marijuana cigarette he was smoking with him.\n\n“Hey,” Sessions said, “let me get a hit off that shit, man, will you?”\n\nJames' newest satirical compilation is out now and available from Amazon, Barnes & Noble, and soon at WalMart.com.\n\nThe marijuana user agreed, and Sessions took the joint from him. The Attorney General put it to his lips and took a deep drag. He held the smoke in his lungs for an extended moment. Then, as he exhaled, he spoke to the man.\n\n“Man, I’m telling you,” Sessions said, “this Russia shit is really getting to me, man. It’s like, why didn’t I just tell the truth to Franken? If I knew I had spoken to Russian diplomats more than once, and that it was just part of my duties as part of the Armed Forces committee, why didn’t I just tell the truth, man?”\n\nSmoke began to fill the immediate area as Sessions puffed and puffed away.\n\n“Clearly I made it look like something shady happened, even if it didn’t,” Sessions admitted through another long drag, “and so I guess I have really no one else to blame for this mess. In the public eye, and according to the evidence so far I either lied under oath, forgot, or well, okay, I either lost or forgot. And we all know it’s hard to forget meeting with foreign ambassadors, as that’s not something you do every day, eve as part of the SASC.”\n\nIn the end, Sessions thanked the man for sharing his marijuana with him.\n\n“This has really helped,” Sessions said, “and now I can see what all the hippies, libtards, and libtarded hippies are onto this Devil Weed about. Thank God you were white and I could share this with you instead of being, you know, a variant. Then I’d have had to have you arrested and locked up. I guess it’s not all bad after all, huh?”\n\nSessions handed the nearly depleted joint back to the man, and went inside. There, his father Gepetto worked feverishly on a way to get his nose to stop growing every time he told a lie. He has yet to succeed.\n\nThe White House declined to comment.

The contention in the application is that the process didn’t meet the Federation’s bylaw requirements, and that Crispin should be disallowed from acting as a referendum official.\n\n“While I’m not worried about Mr. Crispin, he is a man of steel, it is frustrating that the CFS feels it is acceptable to spend student money suing people who are just doing the job we ask them to do,” said Hernandez. “Mr. Crispin is a hardworking advocate for students.”\n\n“We don’t need to spend students’ money in court, we need to give students an opportunity to say if they want to be a part of the Canadian Federation of Students or not.”\n\nThe Students’ Union agreed not to hold the vote this month in order to avoid being taken to court, leaving the future of the referendum process unclear.",

It was called the Nanuk and had a V10 diesel, and was essentially a lifted and toughened R8 or something. Well now the rumor mill claims the concept has been kicked over to Lamborghini to become a real thing in the form of a Huracan—now called the Safari.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis concept of an off-road supercar has been shuffling around Volkswagen Group for years, originally starting out as oddly intriguing Giugiaro Parcour from Italdesign and morphing into the Audi Nanuk concept. Now, as Automobile Magazine reports, this odd creature may exist in the future as a Lamborghini.\n\nFrom Automobile:\n\nAccording to the Sant’Agata grapevine, there is talk of shifting control of Lambo to Porsche. At the same time, the rumor mill in Wolfsburg suggests Audi will also move under Porsche’s control, joining Bentley and Bugatti. Such an arrangement would leave the individual brand identities untouched while creating a variety of synergy effects.﻿\n\nIn the meantime, the Huracán lineup will be given more muscle, with Speedster and Barchetta versions coming, along with a hardcore SV model and an even hotter GT3 Stradale. There’ll also be a Huracán Targa to complement the roadster and a lightweight Superleggera version. But the most audacious iteration by far will the Huracán Safari, which will feature height-adjustable suspension, bigger wheel arches, all-terrain body protection panels, all-wheel drive, and four-wheel steering. While not ready to tackle the Rubicon, Lamborghini R & D claims the almost go-anywhere Huracán—which will be available in coupe and roadster form—is absolutely unbeatable on rough Italian C-roads where ground clearance and wheel travel are essential.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat a wild fucking idea. Apparently that’s not the only insane product to be expected from Lamborghini in the near-future, as the report also goes on to describe an Aventador replacement with over 1,000 horsepower, utilizing a soft hybrid setup coupled with an 800 horsepower 7.0 liter V12. Again, all of this is just rumor-speak.\n\nInterestingly, the mag also reports that the current Huracan’s V10 will bite the dust when that model’s replacement is introduced following the new Aventador. Instead, the new Huracan will get a V8 from Porsche with some model trims also adopting a soft-hybrid setup.\n\nAll of this sounds insane but extremely exciting. I very much want a Lamborghini rally fighter that isn’t the imminent Urus SUV. I’m also completely comfortable with an onslaught of insanely powerful hybrids. If any part of any of this is true, there’s going to be a lot of incredulous reactions over the next few years. Maybe Lamborghini finally has the guts to do what Audi wouldn’t.",

  "latent_8180": "City leaders want more people to use transit as they seek to grow Minneapolis' population, but several local urbanists feel some relatively simple improvements are being overlooked.\n\nCase in point: Bus stops. For many people unfamiliar with local transit, the bus system at a glance can be quite intimidating.\n\nUniversity of Minnesota professor David Levinson has written extensively and recently at Streets.MN about what he has dubbed the \"sorry state of bus stop signs\" in the Twin Cities. Levinson argues that bus signs in the region provide too little information, particularly compared to other transit-friendly cities.\n\n“If you go to most bus stops in the city of Minneapolis, the bus stop sign says 'bus stop,'\" Levinson said in an interview this fall. \"Which is I guess better than not having a sign at all. But if you go to another city where they care about transit, the bus stop signs provide a lot of information about where the buses are going, when they run, what the schedule is.\"\n\nThe basic \"bus stop\" sign is being upgraded to include unique stop identifier numbers (to track arrivals on a smartphone) and a Metro Transit phone number. Some higher-frequency poles and shelters include route numbers, route descriptions, stop numbers and timetables. Fewer feature a basic map of the bus route, as is often the case in New York (left) and Chicago.\n\nThe ease-of-use of the city's bus system is important, since city officials are preparing to invest $60 million into a $200 million streetcar line partly to attract higher transit ridership. Streetcars run about the same speed as buses (page 7), but supporters argue they are more reliable and generate more economic development.\n\nMetro Transit spokesman John Siqveland said extra information is included at stops with the most ridership. About 900 of the more than 2,700 Metro Transit stops in Minneapolis contain information beyond \"bus stop,\" he said.\n\n“In places, there are a majority of bus stops throughout the region that are just a 'bus stop' sign,\" Siqveland said. \"But that doesn’t mean that’s where the customers are using the stops.\"\n\nIn his blog post, Levinson lists in order his priorities for what he thinks should be included at bus stops: station name, routes served, destinations that can be reached, frequency, hours of service, schedule, way to flag the bus, map of routes serving the stop, map of neighborhood around the stop, and several others improvements. Many of these are featured on Seattle's new signs (below).\n\nSiqveland noted that at transit centers, park and ride locations, rail stations, Marq2 (on Marquette Avenue) and on Nicollet Mall, stops feature much of the information Levinson is seeking.\n\nHe said that they have prioritized providing more information online since 2010, based on feedback from customers. People new to the bus system can plan a trip on Metro Transit’s website, check real-time departure information on their phone with Next Trip, or use third-party tools like Google Maps and OMG Transit to navigate. Much of it assumes people have ready access to smartphones, however.\n\nAdvanced research is important for using transit, Siqveland says. \"If I’m going to drive somewhere new, I don’t get in my car and pull out of my driveway and expect that the street signs will – on their own – help me navigate there,\" he said.\n\nRoute maps are perhaps the least common feature on bus signs in Minneapolis. At many heavily trafficked Hennepin Avenue shelters, for example, the information is limited to route descriptions and timetables (right). Siqveland said a \"couple hundred\" of Metro Transit's shelters across their network include them (example below from South Minneapolis).\n\nMaps of the entire system are featured at newer major transit hubs like the Chicago-Lake Transit Center. The Uptown Transit Center will soon be upgraded to include system maps and real-time arrival information, Siqveland said.\n\nThere are about 885 shelters in Minneapolis and St. Paul, according to a recent city staff report. Siqveland said many of the shelters (about 330, based on the staff report) are owned by CBS Outdoor, which offers limited space for transit information. When they have space in Metro Transit-owned shelters, they prioritize schedules and then add maps if there is room, he said.\n\nA study cited by Levinson shows that signage and stop improvements are among the most cost-effective improvements to improve bus ridership (page 10). Annual reports from Metro Transit show that core urban route ridership increased .7 percent in 2010, 3.9 percent in 2011 and remained flat in 2012.\n\nIt appears that there is an interest for better signage among riders. On Monday morning, Metro Transit posted on its Facebook page asking riders to take a survey about bus signage.\n\n\"How hard would it be to put maps of the routes in the shelters?\" asked one commenter.\n\n,\" wrote another commenter.\n\nPeople on Twitter also reacted enthusiastically when shown New York signage:",
  "latent_8241": "The term Russian soul (Russian: Русская душа, Rússkaya dushá; also great Russian soul, mystifying Russian soul) has been used in literature to describe Russian identity.[1] The writings of many Russian writers such as Nikolai Gogol, Leo Tolstoy and Fyodor Dostoyevsky offer descriptions of the Russian soul.\n\nThe term [ edit ]\n\nThe concept of a Russian soul arose in the 1840s chiefly as a literary phenomenon. Famous author Nikolai Gogol and literary critic Vissarion Belinskii jointly coined the term upon the publication of Gogol’s masterpiece Dead Souls in 1842. At the time landowners often referred to their serfs as “souls” for accounting purposes, and the novel’s title refers to the protagonist’s scheme of purchasing claims to deceased serfs. Apart from this literal meaning, however, Gogol also intended the title as an observation of landowners’ loss of soul in exploiting serfs.[2]\n\nVissarion Belinskii, a notedly radical critic, took Gogol’s intentions a few steps farther and inferred from the novel a new recognition of a national soul, existing apart from the government and founded in the lives of the lower class. Indeed, Belinskii used the term “Russian soul” several times in his analyses of Gogol’s work, and from there the phrase grew in prominence, and eventually became more clearly defined through the writings of authors such as Fyodor Dostoyevsky. This famous brand of nationalism, however, was the product of a continuous effort by Russia’s various classes to define a national identity.[2]\n\nGogol and his contemporaries established literature as Russia’s new weapon of choice, the tool by which it could inform itself of its greatness and urge the nation to its destined position as a world leader. Gogol may not have had such grand notions, but with the help of Vissarion Belinsky he paved the way for a new concept of Russian identity - the great Russian soul. As opposed to the preceding “Russian spirit” (Русский дух), which focused on Russia’s past, “Russian soul” was an expression of optimism. It stressed Russia’s historical youth and its ability, by following the wisdom of the peasant, to become the savior of the world. Indeed, although the concept of the Russian soul grew upon Western ideas, its advocates believed that Russia had made those ideas its own and would use them to save Europe from itself.[2]\n\nCulmination of the concept [ edit ]\n\nDostoyevsky [ edit ]\n\nThe Russian soul evolved and entered into Western consciousness in the following decades, most famously through the work of Fyodor Dostoyevsky. In his novels and stories, Dostoyevsky exhibited an often anti-European nationalism and frequently suggested a \"people's spirit\" held together by \"unexpressed, unconscious ideas which are merely strongly felt\". By Dostoyevsky's death in 1881, the \"Russian soul\" had completed its evolution in Russia.[2]\n\nAfter Dostoyevsky [ edit ]\n\nFrom about 1880 to 1930, largely thanks to Dostoyevsky, the \"Russian soul\" concept spread to other countries and began to affect foreign perception of the Russian people. For many Europeans the idea offered a positive alternative to the typical view of Russians as backward, instead depicting the Russian people as an example of the innocence the West had lost. The popularity of the \"Russian soul\" continued into the 20th century but faded as Soviet power increased. By the 1930s the concept was slipping into obscurity, but it would survive in the work of the numerous writers who devised it.[2]",

The camp was used to move fighters in and out of Libya, plot attacks and store weapons, the statement said.\n\n“ISIS and al-Qaeda have taken advantage of ungoverned spaces in Libya to establish sanctuaries for plotting, inspiring and directing terror attacks,” the statement said, using an acronym for Islamic State.\n\nA U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the strikes were carried out by armed drones.\n\nThe last-known U.S. strike in Libya was on Jan. 19, a day before Trump’s inauguration, when more than 80 Islamic State militants, some believed to be plotting attacks in Europe, died in U.S. air strikes on camps outside Sirte.\n\nThat strike was led by two B-2 bombers, which dropped about 100 precision-guided munitions on the camps.\n\nIslamic State took over Sirte in early 2015, turning it into its most important base outside the Middle East and attracting large numbers of foreign fighters to the city. The group imposed its hard-line rule on residents and extended its control along about 155 miles (250 km) of Libya’s Mediterranean coastline.\n\nBut it struggled to keep a footing elsewhere in Libya and was forced out of Sirte by last December after a six-month campaign led by brigades from the western city of Misrata and backed by U.S. air strikes.\n\nIslamic State militants have shifted to desert valleys and inland hills southeast of Tripoli as they seek to exploit Libya’s political divisions after their defeat in Sirte.\n\nThe statement said the strikes were carried out in coordination with Libya’s Government of National Accord.\n\nThe United Nations launched a road map on Wednesday for a renewed international effort to break a political stalemate in Libya and end the turmoil that followed the country’s 2011 uprising.\n\nThe U.N.-backed Government of National Accord established under a December 2015 deal never fully materialized in Tripoli, leaving Libya with three competing governments aligned with rival armed alliances.",

Jonathan Oosting, The Detroit News\n\nBuy Photo It is “absolutely imperative” that Democrats help Hillary Clinton defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election, Bernie Sanders said Thursday in an impassioned plea to Michigan, Minnesota, Tennessee and Oregon delegates to the Democratic National Convention. (Photo: Jonathan Oosting / The Detroit News)Buy Photo\n\nKing of Prussia, Pa. — It is “absolutely imperative” that Democrats help Hillary Clinton defeat Donald Trump in the presidential election, Bernie Sanders said Thursday in an impassioned plea to Michigan, Minnesota, Tennessee and Oregon delegates to the Democratic National Convention.\n\nThe Vermont senator used his roughly 20-minute breakfast speech to describe ways his own policy proposals have influenced her campaign against Republican nominee Donald Trump, who he called a “demagogue” unfit to lead the country.\n\n“Donald Trump is the most dangerous candidate to run for president in the modern history of this country,” Sanders told delegates in suburban Philadelphia.\n\nHe noted that Trump was part of the “birther” movement that questioned the citizenship of President Barack Obama.\n\n“That was an effort to de-legitimize the election of the first African-American president we have had, based on racism pure and simple,” Sanders said. “That type of person must never, ever become president.”\n\nThe Vermont senator — who received a rock star reception Thursday morning with delegates standing on chairs to get his photo and take video — sought to bridge an ongoing convention divide between his supporters and those backing Clinton, who is expected later Thursday to accept the Democratic nomination for president. “Bernie or Bust” delegates allege the primary process was “rigged” to benefit Clinton, a claim they say was validated by a weekend leak of Democratic National Committee emails.\n\nBut even with Sanders’ endorsement of Clinton, several Michigan delegates said his speech wasn’t enough to change their minds about the former Secretary of State. One “Berner” said she’ll vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein in November. Another said she isn’t sure, but it won’t be for Clinton. A third said Clinton needs to keep talking about the issues and pushing toward the left before he makes a decision.\n\n“I’m not there yet,” said Christopher Geiger, 34, a Sanders delegate from Holland. “What I really want to see is Hillary Clinton talking about the issues. If she keeps talking about the issues, I think a lot of Sanders supporters could eventually get behind her.”\n\nCLOSE Reporters Maureen Feighan and Jonathan Oosting discuss the final two days of the Democratic National Convention\n\nLeesha Fagan of Grand Rapids said it was “beautiful” to see Sanders speak Thursday morning. She even brought posters she designed for Sanders and gave him one.\n\n“I got to give him a hug,” she said with tears in her eyes.\n\nBut Fagan, who was among dozens of Sanders delegates who walked out of the convention Tuesday after the roll call vote and later taped her mouth shut in protest, said she won’t vote for Clinton. She’ll vote for Stein.\n\n“I don’t trust her word and I know her record,” Fagan said of Clinton. “Her record is you can’t trust her word.”\n\nAnd while she’s “scared” of Donald Trump, “I think the Clinton campaign and the oligarchy will rig the election anyway.”\n\nBut another Sanders delegate, Ian Robinson of Ann Arbor, said “a vast majority” of the Sanders delegates understand the importance of supporting Clinton in the fall.\n\nSanders outlined how his campaign helped pushed the Democratic Party to the left. The Vermont senator, who proposed free college tuition for all, said his campaign worked with Clinton’s on her new proposal that would make college tuition free for families who earn less than $125,000 a year.\n\nShe doesn’t agree with his call for a single-payer health care system but has proposed doubling community health center funding, he said. And she now supports adding a “public option” to the Affordable Care Act -- creating a government-backed insurance plan that would compete with private plans on the health insurance exchanges. The public option was dropped from the final version of Obama’s health care bill in 2010 to help ensure its passage..\n\n“This is not insignificant,” Sanders said to a crowd of hundreds. “These are major steps forward.”\n\nHe also noted the party platform, adopted Monday, includes issues he championed on the campaign trail.\n\n“It is no longer a radical idea to say that we’re going to raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour,” he said to applause.\n\nSanders was greeted by chants of “Bernie! Bernie!” and received little pushback as he urged his fans to back Clinton. In a Monday afternoon speech to delegates, supporters had booed when he urged them to vote for the former Secretary of State and first lady.\n\nMore than 100 Sanders supporters staged a convention walkout on Tuesday after his unifying gesture to make Clinton’s nomination unanimous, and they later used a sit-in to shut down a media tent outside the Wells Fargo Arena.\n\nMichigan delegation breakfasts this week had been marked by a series of interruptions from Sanders faithful.\n\nDetroit Mayor Mike Duggan, who spoke at the convention this week in support of Clinton, on Thursday praised Sanders and his supporters, saying they “have changed the course of this country” by infusing new ideas into the campaign.\n\nPresident Obama inspired Duggan to get back into politics, the former CEO of the Detroit Medical Center told delegates, and Sanders inspired him by running a presidential campaign without dark money or super PAC contributions.\n\n“Bernie Sanders has shown us that something is possible,” Duggan said. “That there may be a handful of people with tons and tons of money, but when one person stands up and tells the truth, you can get millions of people to mobilize.”\n\nU.S. Rep. Brenda Lawrence, D-Southfield, also extended an olive branch to Sanders supporters, saying he was a needed voice at an important moment in the country’s history.\n\n“You can stay with Bernie and vote for Hillary Clinton,” Lawrence told delegates.\n\njoosting@detroitnews.com\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/2aqgH5w",

  "latent_8577": "Once a week in London, Gordon Brown squares off against his political opponents. As British Prime Minister, the Labour Party leader must personally appear before Parliament each Wednesday. This isn’t the same as memorizing speeches written by some third person or sending proxies to field softball questions from a tame press corps. When Brown goes before the House of Commons, he gets grilled by the Conservative Party and David Cameron, current Leader of the Opposition.\n\nThis British constitutional convention, known as the Prime Minister’s Questions, is not unique to the UK. Such question-and-answer sessions are commonplace in English-speaking democracies. Canada has a similar convention, known as Question Period, which occurs each sitting day in the federal Parliament, and also in the provincial legislatures. India’s Lok Sabha has Question Hour. The Dáil Éireann in the the Republic of Ireland has what are called Leader’s Questions. Oceanic democracies Australia and New Zealand both have Question Time.\n\nIn fact, the United States of America was the sole English-speaking country I could find that has yet to institute this sort of practice.\n\nA replay of yesterday’s PMQ aired on C-Span last night as I was drifting to sleep. I was startled awake by the blunt frankness of PM Greg Hands:\n\n“The biography on the Prime Minister’s website records no achievements in the past year, but it does boast about his popularity as a schoolboy. We are told that he “joined in every aspect of school life, quickly becoming popular. Given the Stalinist adulation from the past, can he explain why this week he has become Britain’s least popular Prime Minister ever?”\n\nThese weekly events ensure that lines of communication remain open between the Legislative and Executive branches of government. They put pressure on elected officials to hold other elected officials accountable for bad decisions. A sense of transparency exists between the government and it’s people.\n\nWe don’t have that in the United States.\n\nThe annual State of the Union Address, in which the U.S. President addresses Congress, not only occurs less frequently but has become little more than a formality. The format of this ritualized event leaves no opportunity for political opponents to challenge what the President has said and–usually more importantly–to inquire about issues not mentioned and things left unsaid. Knowing that his words will go unchallenged, the President is free to proceed with a series of remarks that lack substance. Instead of candor and explanation, the President offers platitudes. Opposition figures like House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi, planted directly behind the President, have to (or perhaps want to) clap and cheer. The clever soundbites are organized in such a way so that not clapping would be interpreted as being against “protecting the American people from another 9/11.”\n\nOnly once during his eight years as “leader of the free world” has George W. Bush faced anything near the level of flak that confronts British Prime Minister Gordon Brown on a weekly basis. That was when he ran for reelection in 2004; and even then, all he had to do was memorize articulate speeches and regurgitate sound bites Karl Rove whispered through his earpiece.\n\nWatching the way they do things elsewhere may shed light on why people in foreign nations tend to perceive the USA as intellectually bankrupt. The leaders we elect speak volumes about who we are as a people. Can you fathom George W. Bush under the sort of cross-examination that fell on Gordon Brown yesterday? Can you imagine Harry Reid or Nancy Pelosi giving it to him with the effectiveness of David Cameron? Not only are American politicians not scrutinized; neither are they versed in the art of scrutinizing each other. Four years of cross-examination from an articulate Left would have outed our President as the incompetent and morally empty man that he is. In such a political environment, any citizenry (even one as politically disengaged as America’s) would have then had the wherewithal not to reelect him in 2004 to keep fucking things up for another four years. In fact, the mere prospect of facing such a daunting audience would probably have discouraged Bush from running in the first place; or led his supporters to weigh his strengths and shortcomings and to refrain from nominating him in 2000.\n\nIt seems the elected representatives in Great Britain actually want to be politicians. By contrast, American “public service” has evolved to mean something else: attending ritzy functions and shaking hands of fellow-elites. “We the people” have become an annoyance, like a bug bite that’s hard to reach. The trick for politicians is figuring out how to neutralize us–hence the politics of mutual back-scratching America’s elected officials and wealthy campaign funders with special agendas.\n\nWe need to fundamentally alter how politicians approach their jobs. That starts with updating our expectations. Both Barack Obama and John McCain promise to “fix Washington” and to “end partisan bickering.” But what cripples the American political system is not partisan bickering, per se, but rather the tangential issues that Republicans and Democrats bicker about. Vibrant debate is a good thing. Imagine a Legislative Branch where the Right acted more like Ron Paul and the Left more like Dennis Kucinich. Both are willing to do the thankless legwork of a true statesman, knowing full well that they’ll be mocked and ridiculed for it. Currently these men are outcasts withwithin their own respective parties; in a nation that truly valued representative democracy, they’d be party leaders.",
  "latent_8671": "Amanda Marcotte, no raving beauty she (the objective rating of her looks is germane to this discussion insofar as it partly explains the motivation for why feminists hold the irrational opinions they do), has a beef with sociobiology, aka evolutionary psychology.\n\nI read and research a lot of “evolutionary psychology”, and while they are very good at getting people to cop to anti-feminist opinions and sexist behaviors, I have not really seen many—any?—that prove their contention that these behaviors or opinions are encoded in the genes instead of learned from the environment. They simply note people are sexist and claim that it’s genetic. I sense an agenda there, because if you were putting science in front of an agenda, you would acknowledge the huge body of research supporting the idea that we learn our behaviors and beliefs from our environment. But I’m happy [ed: no, she’s not] to read studies that prove that sexism is genetic and unchangeable instead of socialized and changeable! I just haven’t seen it in all the years I’ve been writing about this.\n\nFeminists are scared shitless of the implications of sociobiological theory, and it’s easy to see why. The whole edifice of feminism teeters on the shaky proposition that sex differences feminists find unpalatable are amenable to change (i.e., “improvement”) via government and societal intervention. If it is found that sex differences are instead hard-wired into the brain architecture through the process of millions of years of natural and sexual selection and are resistant to social reengineering schemes, then feminism as a practical ideology is utterly discredited.\n\nWhat’s a man-jawed, fuzz-faced, beady-eyed fembot to do when her raison d’être is rendered null and void? One thing we know for certain: she won’t be happy to read studies dropping a hot, steaming deuce into her brain case.\n\nThere is a level of psychological distress more disconcerting, more bowel-evacuating, than even that of coming to realize one is hitched to a hollow ideology. Ultimately, feminists are afraid of what evolutionary psychology has to reveal because feminists are afraid of attractiveness standards, and of unchangeable attractiveness standards in particular. Because, you see, in the arena of sexual marketability, it is men who are the sex with more options to improve their dating market value. Women are, for the most part, stuck with their desirability, or lack thereof, the moment they are conceived. Outside of expensive, radical cosmetic surgery the effectiveness of which is questionable at best and monstrous at worst, the average woman will not be able to make herself more beautiful and, hence, more likely to snag a high value man anytime in her life. She can only lower her mate value by, for example, getting fat, old, burdened with bastard spawn or facially disfigured.\n\nAccepting this truth is so depressing for many women that elaborate delusions, rationalizations and nonsensical ideologies occupy large swaths of their neural pathways to misdirect and medicate their overstuffed egos.\n\nAs the gleaming Chateau on the hill once pointed out, accurate generalizations about immutable human characteristics are the holy water to feminists’ undead orthodoxy:\n\nif you’ll notice, women are the most outraged by the idea of evolutionary psychology and unchangeable genetic fate. that physical beauty should be so unalterable and at the same time so critical to a woman’s prospects for snagging an alpha male of her own sends shivers down her spine. if true, it means they cannot do much to improve their value on the open market. no educational attainment, no carreer success, no makeup, no exercise [to a point], no hob nobbing with the right people — nothing much matters but for the face they were given when mommy’s egg was fertilized by daddy’s swimmers. yet, this is precisely how the sexual market works. and so, as the gears of the pretty lie machine clank and sputter to dispense more of its life-affirming self-delusions, the “social conditioning” brigade strikes out at the descending shroud of hopeless darkness.\n\nRead Marcotte’s words. Listen to her distress signals. “Learned behaviors”. “Social conditioning”. “Cultural conditioning”. These empty slogans — so pleasant on the ears of blank slatists and equalists and temperamental bolsheviks — are the lifeblood of feminist thought. To undermine the slogans is to ling chi the souls of their adherents. Marcotte frantically and blindly swings them around like a verbal sword, not to persuade or enlighten, but to keep her encircling enemies at bay. This is argument in service to self-preservation, nothing more, for the evidence she marshals in support of her worldview is slowly rotting from the inside out. As science inexorably chips away at the justifications for believing in these feminist fairy tales, the cognitive dissonance that believers must feel rattles their confidence and sends them reeling backwards into paroxysms of strawmen, illogic, sour grapes, non sequiturs and ad hominem. The stuck pig always lashes out most violently when cornered.\n\nFeminists will answer, with all the self-contradiction that only they can expertly dispense absent the slightest hint of irony, that sociobiology is not a hard science because we can’t go back in time to observe our ancient ancestors’ mating habits, thus relegating any theory of human mating behavior to the province of “just-so stories”. Such penetrating insight!\n\nWell, no shit. We can’t go back in time to observe apes evolving into humans, either, so according to feminist logic that must mean the theory of evolution is wrong. Scientists gather evidence for historical biological processes by analyzing what is available to them in the present environment, and then draw inferences from the data. Additional data and experimental testing will either buttress or weaken a particular hypothesis. This isn’t just-so fantasizing; it’s the scientific method.\n\nSadly for Marcotte and her ilk, to date the accumulated data is buttressing a genetic view of human nature and weakening fifty years of environmental supremacy belief.\n\nThe question of evolutionary psychology’s status as a hard science is not something of much relevance. All that matters is whether or not its findings make sense. And compared to competing humanities and “soft science” fields, evolutionary psychology makes a lot of sense. It, and not “cultural conditioning” theories, best explains the patterns of human behavior anyone can see in action every day if they aren’t up to their eyeballs in denial, or striving for social status points over their SWPL frenemies.\n\nMarcotte is insisting on cultural explanations for which there is much less evidence than there is for genetic explanations. If feminists present a theory of human behavior which explains the available evidence better than evolutionary psychology, I’ll give it its due. Of course they will not do so because they and their cohorts have nothing but lies. For example, the highly popular “stereotype threat” theory held near and dear by racial egalitarians — close cousins of feminism — has recently been proven a sham.\n\nEven evidence that supports a cultural primacy interpretation is fraught with danger to feminist orthodoxy. For what is culture but a manifestation of genetic propensity?\n\nCulture does not spring up out of the ground unseeded, like a summoned monolith. Human genetic disposition seeds the ground and creates culture, unleashing a macro feedback loop where culture and genes interact in perpetuity. Those “cultural judgments” you so recoil from are actually subconscious reinforcements of ancient biological truths.\n\nIf feminists find some smidgen of peer-bypassed evidence tucked away somewhere in a private school’s gender studies program that, for instance, Playboy has pushed men to value young, slender babes over the old, fat chicks men would otherwise prefer, then they will have to account for the unnerving fact that the culture *just happened* to influence men to favor slender babes over fat chicks, and not the opposite. Then they will find that most cultures across the globe mysteriously influence men to favor young, thin women over old fatties. The muddled and tormented bridging of all those coincidences into some kind of semi-coherent thought will belie their theories and rob them of any parsimony. Why does culture, if it is the primary influencing force of sexual behavior as feminists claim, almost always act in one direction on fundamental human dynamics such as mate choice? That is a question feminists dare not entertain.\n\nSo feminism, along with Communism, multiculturalism and egalitarianism, falls victim to the same tropes that all human nature denialists share: namely, the belief that people behave in upsetting ways because some nebulous cultural mind ray tells them to behave in upsetting ways.\n\nThe “blame the media” refrain is the reflexive blurt of the human nature denialists. It comes in many flavors: blame society, blame cultural conditioning, blame stereotyping, blame heteronormativity, blame subtextual bias… anything to avoid confronting the reality of evolved immutable human preferences for some traits over others. People are intolerant of obesity because it innately disgusts them, not because “the media” tells them to be disgusted. Media propaganda can make it more or less acceptable to publicly express that disgust, but it can’t create the disgust out of thin air.\n\nOne should not underestimate how convenient the feminist beliefs in gender equalism, social conditioning, and the malleability of human behavior is to the realization of their goals. Because without those beliefs, feminists won’t be able to get on with the program of altering the oscillation of the evil sexist cultural mind rays. Their worst fear will instead emerge to soak up the light of day: human nature is less alterable than they wish were so, and essential contours of our sexual preferences are heavily influenced by a universally shared genetic legacy. Where the genetic predilection for certain mate characteristics is not universally shared, it is racially or ethnically shared, and thus, just as immutable.\n\nContrary to the hopes and dreams of rainbow ejaculating egalitarian gasbags, what the science of evolutionary psychology and genetics tells us is that there are born winners and there are born losers, on the individual and on the population level, and you’ll have no choice but to sit back and get used to it. Since most feminists are ugly, accepting this truth would deliver a mortal blow to their egos.\n\nThis week, I will present three more of those evolutionary psychology studies that so vex feminists. Hopefully Marcotte will catch wind of them. The thought of her groaning under the weight of the anti-equalitarian evidence as her forehead vein throbs and her soul splinters into a million shards of impotent grrlrage fills me with sadistic joy.",
  "latent_8680": "Organization, conservation and expression of the Evx1/Evx1as locus\n\nThe Evx1 locus is located 50 kb downstream of the HoxA gene cluster on chromosome 6 (Fig. 1a). Evx1 and Evx1as are developmentally regulated, displaying peak and concordant expression during gastrulation5. They are both also highly expressed in vivo in the pre-somitic mesoderm (PSM)32. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) of E7.5 and E9.5 embryos demonstrates the Evx1 and Evx1as are co-expressed in the primitive streak during gastrulation (Fig. 1c). At E7.5, both Evx1 and Evx1as are expressed at the posterior-proximal side of the embryo, which is the location of the primitive streak. At E9.5, both transcripts localize to the tail bud, which contains the embryological remnants of the primitive streak. Thus, Evx1 and Evx1as are co-expressed during gastrulation.\n\nLike many lncRNA-coding gene pairs30, Evx1 and Evx1as are expressed from opposite DNA strands in a sense-antisense configuration (Fig. 1a). Interestingly, there are two other lncRNAs within the distal end of the HoxA cluster, Hox11as and HOTTIP25, which are expressed in an antisense direction with respect to Hox11 and Hox13 coding genes, respectively (Fig. 1a). Evx1as is expressed as at least two different isoforms according to EST and depostied cDNA data; the second exon overlaps with the start of Evx1 by ~70 bp and the first exon resides in the first intron of Evx1 (Fig. 1a). We confirmed only 1% of the Evx1as transcript contains the first exon in D4 EBs (Supplementary Figure 1A). EVX1 is highly conserved throughout the protein coding sequence, whereas Evx1as displays notable conservation at the promoter (Fig. 1a), like many lncRNAs33. The human EVX1-EVX1AS locus is syntenic with the murine locus. EVX1AS has two conserved promoters (intronic or bidirectional), but is also expressed from one additional promoter, located 3′ of EVX1 (Fig. 1b).\n\nEVX1 regulates anterior-posterior patterning during gastrulation\n\nIn order to study the function of EVX1 and Evx1as, we used EB differentiation as a model for early in vivo mouse embryonic development. Day 4 EBs grown in serum or serum free media (SFM) with recombinant BMP4 display a very similar transcriptional program to embryos undergoing gastrulation7. Evx1 and Evx1as were most highly expressed when differentiated under BMP4 and WNT3A conditions (Fig. 1d), which suggests that they might be either downstream targets of the BMP4 and WNT3A signalling pathways or that BMP4 and WNT3A enhance the generation of posterior mesoderm cell types, wherein the Evx1 locus is expressed. Evx1 and Evx1as were expressed at a much lower level in EBs grown in SFM with Activin A, which is an anterior/dorsal mesoderm inducing factor34. Our results are consistent with expression of human EVX1 in these same growth factors10. Evx1 and Evx1as display a similar expression pattern to Mixl1 (Fig. 1d), a related homeodomain transcription factor which is also expressed in nascent posterior mesoderm12. Expression of pan-mesoderm genes such as Brachyury (T) and Sp5 was similar in BMP4, WNT3A and Activin A, while expression of anterior markers Cer1 and Sox17 was significantly higher in WNT3A and Activin A (Fig. 1d).\n\nWe generated EVX1 ‘knockout’ cell lines using CRISPR-Cas9 gene micro-editing of the homeodomain coding region in exon 2, thus leaving Evx1as unperturbed (Fig. 3a). Two independent compound heterozygous Evx1 gene edited clones were selected based on our previously described NGS screening strategy35. Both clones have small frameshift mutations in both alleles (Fig. 2a), which are predicted to result in a premature stop codons within 20 bps of the deletion site. Thus, no functional DNA-binding domain of EVX1 could be generated by either of these clones. We refer to these CRISPR-edited lines as ‘EVX1-Δfs’ from here on. EVX1-Δfs lines and W9.5 controls were differentiated in serum to D4 under suspension culture conditions to identify a potential regulatory role for EVX1 during gastrulation. EVX1-Δfs D4 EBs appeared phenotypically normal, and indistinguishable from the wildtype controls (Supplementary Figure 1B). However, qPCR analysis revealed that both EVX1-Δfs clones display differences in expression of key anterior and posterior patterning markers, including Mixl1 and Cer1 (Supplementary Figure 1C). There were no significant differences between the two clones, therefore only one was used for subsequent analyses (Clone 14) (Supplementary Figure 1C).\n\nFigure 2: EVX1 is required to regulate anterior-posterior patterning during gastrulation.

Full size image\n\nTo determine whether EVX1 has a global role in anterior-posterior patterning, mRNA-seq was performed on three biological replicates of W9.5 and EVX1-Δfs EBs differentiated for 4 days in serum without LIF (see Methods). Using DESeq2, we identified 802 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). In the absence of functional EVX1, 282 genes were upregulated and 520 genes were downregulated (Fig. 2b). The upregulated genes included many which are preferentially expressed in anterior visceral endoderm and/or anterior mesendoderm (e.g. Sox17, Cer1, and Foxa2). Many of the down regulated genes are normally expressed in posterior mesoderm (e.g. Mixl1, Mesp1, Wnt5a and Fgf3) (Fig. 2b). This suggests there is an imbalance in cellular composition of EVX1-Δfs EBs with loss of posterior cell types and relative expansion of anterior cell types (both mesoderm and endoderm).\n\nUsing Gene Ontology (GO) we found the most highly significantly enriched cell biological process terms among the DEGs were: blood vessel development (35) and morphogenesis (28), pattern specification (38), regulation of the cell cycle (29), gastrulation (16) or formation of primary germ layer (12), cell differentiation (25), cell motion (37) and WNT signalling (20) (Fig. 2d). We undertook hierarchical clustering of the genes within each of the GO Ontology categories (Fig. 2c). Each category contains genes down-regulated (blue) or up-regulated (red) in EVX1-Δfs cells. Within the blood vessel development, patterning and gastrulation categories, there is down-regulation of many ligands, receptors, signalling molecules and transcription factors which are implicated in posterior patterning of mesoderm. These include Bmp4, Wnt2, Fgf10, Kdr (Flk1), Cxcr4, Cited1, Cited2, Cdx2, Hand1, Mixl1, Hes1, Tbx3, Tbx6, Mesp1, Eomes, Snai1 and others. There is also upregulation of a smaller set of key patterning genes which are normally expressed in the AVE, anterior mesendoderm or epiblast. These include Sox17, Nanog, Atm, Zic3, and Foxa2. We also found many genes in the WNT signalling pathway are downregulated in EVX1-Δfs EBs, including Wnt3, Wnt2, Wnt5a, Wnt5b, Lef1, Pitx2, Dvl2, Lrp5 and others. On the other hand, WNT pathway antagonists such as Cer1, Cfc1/cripto and Sfrp1 are upregulated. Interestingly, Evx1 is downregulated in WNT3A KO embryos36, demonstrating that there is a mutual dependence (direct or indirect) between WNT signalling and EVX1. There were no significant changes in expression of any members of the HoxA cluster under these differentiation conditions. Full lists of differentially expressed genes are provided in Supplementary Table 2.\n\nPreviously EVX1 has been shown to directly repress GSC in human ESCs under Activin A growth conditions10. Gsc was not upregulated in either EVX1-Δfs clone by qPCR or RNAseq under serum differentiation conditions (Supplemental Table 2, Supplementary Figure 1C). To ensure that the lack of Gsc upregulation was not due to differences in the differentiation conditions used, we differentiated EVX1-Δfs and W9.5 EBs in SFM with Activin A. We did not find significant upregulation of Gsc (Fig. 2e). Importantly, the A-P gene expression defect in EVX1-Δfs persisted in Activin A. Defective expression of Mixl1 and T remained, and additional significant reduction in expression of the pan mesoderm marker Sp5 was also present in EVX1-Δfs EBs (Fig. 2e). The upregulation of AVE and endoderm markers Cer1 and Sox17 was less dramatic in Activin A, presumably because selective expansion of AVE and anterior tissues dilutes the differences in anterior gene expression between wildtype and EVX1-Δfs EBs (Fig. 2f).\n\nFrom this RNAseq data, it was unclear whether EVX1 exerts its A-P patterning function by directly regulating BMP4 and/or WNT signalling pathways or whether changes in Bmp4/Wnt expression are an indirect result of changes in cellular composition within the EVX1-Δfs EBs. BMP4 and WNT direct EB differentiation towards posterior cell types37, so the aberrant transcriptome in EVX1-Δfs EBs may be primarily due to downregulation of these factors. To address this possibility, we attempted to rescue EVX1-Δfs EBs by culture in SFM with exogenous recombinant WNT3A (20 ng/ml) or BMP4 (10 ng/ml). Under WNT3A conditions, we observed no rescue of Mixl1 gene expression; i.e. it remained significantly down regulated (Fig. 2f). Likewise there was no reversal of the up-regulation of Cer1, suggesting the A-P patterning defect was not rescued by WNT3A (Fig. 2f). Similar results were found for EBs grown in BMP4 (Supplementary Figure 1D). Thus, downregulation of Bmp4 and Wnt genes (Wnt3, Wnt5a and Wnt5b) is likely to be an indirect result of changes in cellular composition of EVX1-Δfs EBs and not due to direct regulation of these factors by EVX1. This data also shows EVX1 is required for appropriate transcriptional responses and differentiation downstream of BMP4 and WNT signalling pathways. This function appears to be conserved in humans, as β-catenin, the major effector of WNT signalling, has been shown to bind to regulatory regions in the EVX1 promoter in differentiated hESCs11. Together, these results confirm EVX1 plays a key role in A-P patterning of nascent mesoderm and endoderm and is essential for regulating the posteriorizing effects of WNTs and BMP4.\n\nCRISPR/Cas9 mediated removal of the Evx1/Evx1as locus results in an identical D-V pattering defect as EVX1-Δfs\n\nBidirectional/antisense transcription from highly expressed, developmentally regulated genes is a common phenomenon in the mammalian genome30. However the functional significance and possible mechanisms of action of such antisense lncRNAs remain topics of debate38,39. The Evx1 locus contains a stable, highly expressed antisense lncRNA associated with Evx1, so it is an ideal locus to study. Visual inspection of RNAseq data from D4 EBs suggests that the majority of the Evx1as transcript is expressed as Evx1as T2 (Fig. 3a). We further validated this by qPCR using primers to distinguish between the different isoforms of Evx1as. Only 1% of the total transcript derived from the overlapping intronic promoter (Supplementary Figure 1A).\n\nWe initially used RNAi, delivered via shRNA containing lentiviral vectors40 to attempt stable knockdown of Evx1as without disturbing the genomic locus (Supplementary Figure 2A) (see Methods). Such an approach has been successful for some lncRNAs but challenging for others41,42. In some cases RNAi has obtained different and more severe phenotypes than constitutive deletions, which may be due to off target or toxicity effects in some cases or due to compensatory events in others43,44. We generated stable clones targeting Evx1as using three independent shRNAs (Supplementary Figure 2A). Unfortunately, none of the clones from any of the three siRNAs displayed knockdown of Evx1as to <50% of WT levels, so we could not make concrete conclusions about the potential function of Evx1as from these experiments. There were no significant changes in expression of key mesoderm genes such as Brachyury, Mixl1, or Evx1 itself (data not shown).\n\nGenetic deletion or mutation remains the gold standard to demonstrate the requirement of a gene’s function43. We therefore performed 3 different CRISPR-Cas9 mediated manipulations of the Evx1/Evx1as locus (Fig. 3a). The first manipulation ‘Del#1’ removed the entire first intronic promoter of Evx1as, which is specific to isoform Evx1as T1 (1% of total transcript) and conserved (Fig. 1a). Removal of this promoter, which generates a small proportion of Evx1as RNA, did not affect expression of Evx1as or Evx1 (data not shown). ‘Del#2’ removed the shared promoter region between Evx1 and Evx1as. This deletion removed 220 bps centred around the beginning of Evx1 and Evx1as transcription, based on ESTs and RNAseq data. This deletion resulted in a dramatic loss of Evx1 reducing the transcript to ~16% of WT levels (Supplementary Figure 2B). However this deletion only decreased Evx1as to ~46% of WT levels. This result may be explained by a more malleable transcriptional start site and/or weaker constraints on transcriptional regulation at the lncRNA promoter. As expected, ‘Del#2’ displayed reduction of Mixl1 and significant upregulation of Cer1, supporting the results from the EVX1-Δfs RNAseq data (Supplemental Figure 2B).\n\nSince Evx1as was still expressed at 46% of WT in ‘Del#2’, we could not draw any definitive conclusions about its potential function. Therefore, we generated a large ~2.6 kb deletion (‘Del#3’) that removed the promoters from both versions of the transcript (to prevent the possibility of isoform switching between the two alternative promoters), as well as the second/third exon (Fig. 3a). Successful deletion was validated by PCR and later by RNAseq (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Figure 2C). This deletion resulted in almost complete ablation of Evx1 by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3b). Since the Evx1as qPCR primers sit inside the deletion site (Fig. 3a), primers were designed for the last exon of the transcript to detect any residual expression. Approximately 15% of WT levels of expression of the last exon of Evx1as remained in the ‘Del#3’ D4 EBs (Supplementary Figure 2D).\n\nTo determine whether Evx1as has any function independent of EVX1, we performed a direct comparison between the transcriptome of EVX1-Δfs and the Evx1as/Evx1 double KO (‘Del#3’). We reasoned that if Evx1as has an independent function from EVX1, then differences should be observed between the two transcriptomes, regardless of whether it functions in transcriptional or post-transcriptional regulation. Transcriptional differences, if present, could be either due to direct transcriptional regulation by Evx1as or an indirect consequence of Evx1as regulating post-transcriptional pathways.\n\nNo significant differences were observed by qPCR between the two lines for a number of gastrulation and A-P patterning genes (Fig. 3b). Both the EVX1-Δfs and Evx1/Evx1as Δ2.6 kb (‘Del#3’) EBs displayed significantly different expression of Mixl1, T and Cer1 relative to WT EBs (Fig. 3b). To determine whether there was any trans function for Evx1as RNA independent of the function of EVX1, we searched for differences genome-wide by mRNAseq. Remarkably, differential gene expression analysis identified only 3 DEGs, two of which were Evx1 and Evx1as, themselves. In the Evx1/Evx1as double KO (‘Del#3’), Evx1 and Evx1as are dramatically reduced to 1% and 4% of EVX1-Δfs (in which Evx1 and Evx1as are expressed the same as WT under serum conditions). The other DEG (Grb10) has no reported role during gastrulation and is unlikely to be of any biological significance. The lack of differences is reflected in the very high correlation observed between the two samples (R2 = 0.9925, Pearson) (Fig. 3c). We therefore conclude that Evx1as does not have function independent of EVX1, and therefore is unlikely to function in trans. This does not rule out a potential function for Evx1as in the regulation of Evx1 in cis (see Discussion).",

For the female player character in Pokémon Crystal with the same Japanese name, see Kris (game).\n\nEthan (Japanese: ヒビキ Hibiki) is the main playable character in Pokémon Gold and Silver and is the male choice in Pokémon Crystal, Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. In Crystal, his female counterpart is Kris, while in HeartGold and SoulSilver, his female counterpart is Lyra.\n\nStoryline in the games\n\nWhen selected as the player character\n\nEthan's journey as a Trainer begins when Professor Elm asks him to run an errand for Mr. Pokémon, who lives north of Cherrygrove City on Route 30. Because he may encounter dangerous wild Pokémon along the way, Elm gives him a choice between three Pokémon to protect him: Cyndaquil, Totodile or Chikorita.\n\nEthan spots another boy his age watching Elm's Lab from outside. When Ethan tries to talk to him, the boy abruptly shoves him away. This boy, Silver, will become Ethan's rival.\n\nEthan continues onward and finally meets Mr. Pokémon and completes his errand. While there he meets Professor Oak who, upon realizing Ethan's bond with his new Pokémon, gives him a Pokédex. On his way back home, Ethan again meets Silver, who has stolen one of Elm's remaining Pokémon. After defeating the boy in battle, the boy tells Ethan his nameGSC/Ethan learns the boy's name from his dropped Trainer CardHGSS, and Ethan relays it to the police in New Bark Town. Professor Elm allows Ethan to keep the Pokémon he chose earlier, and also encourages him to compete in the Johto League.\n\nEthan begins on a Pokémon journey in the Johto region, facing off against its eight Gym Leaders, defeating and disbanding the revived Team Rocket, and becoming Pokémon League Champion by defeating the Elite Four and its previous Champion, Lance at Indigo Plateau. Along the way he also teaches Silver to respect Pokémon as living creatures and not just as tools for battle.\n\nAfter being declared the Pokémon League Champion, Ethan then journeys by ship from Olivine City to Vermilion City in Kanto. Traveling around that region, he battles against another set of eight Gym Leaders. Upon getting permission from Professor Oak in Pallet Town, Ethan heads for Mt. Silver via Route 28. His journey comes to a close when, deep in Mt. Silver's cave, he faces the Champion from Pallet Town, Pokémon Trainer Red, who had been training there since shortly after he became Pokémon League Champion three years prior.\n\nWhen not selected as the player character\n\nIn Pokémon Crystal, if Kris is selected, then the male player character will not appear in the game at all (although his sprite will be used in a link battle with another game from Generation II as well as opponents in Viridian City's Trainer House).\n\nIn Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver, if Lyra is selected to be the player character, Ethan meets her in New Bark Town at the start of the game. In this particular scene, he is seen with a Marill. He will always have Marill even if another starter Pokémon is selected. In addition, he doesn't appear to take the remaining starter Pokémon. His role in the storyline of HeartGold and SoulSilver is similar to that of Lucas/Dawn in Pokémon Diamond, Pearl, and Platinum if they are not chosen as the player character, while Lyra takes this place if he is selected as the player. He teaches the player how to catch Pokémon on Route 29 (replacing the Dude from Gold, Silver, and Crystal).\n\nWhile playing as Lyra, his grandparents run the Pokémon Day Care on Route 34. He also gives the player the Fashion Case in Goldenrod Tunnel and the Vs. Recorder on Route 31.

Jimmy follows Ethan's design from Pokémon Gold and Silver. Much like Ethan, Jimmy is from New Bark Town and receives a starter from Professor Elm. He also encounters the counterparts of Silver and Kris on his journey.\n\nEthan's second counterpart has a cameo appearance at the beginning of Zoroark: Master of Illusions, where he had a battle against Ash. This counterpart follows Ethan's updated design from Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver. It has been argued that this is Jimmy in an updated look, rather than a different counterpart, but this counterpart is identified as \"Hibiki\" (Ethan's Japanese name) in the Japanese DVD of the movie.\n\nPokémon\n\nThis is a listing of Ethan's known Pokémon in the anime:\n\nDonphan Ethan used Donphan in a battle against Ash at the beginning of the thirteenth movie. During the battle, it fought against Pikachu. It was not shown who won the battle. Donphan's only known move is Rollout. Debut Zoroark: Master of Illusions\n\nIn Pokémon Generations\n\nEthan made two brief appearances in The Lake of Rage. First, he and Lance infiltrated the Team Rocket HQ separately. He then communicated with Lance through his Pokégear about updates on their mission, and acted as a decoy for Lance's attacks. As a silent protagonist, he wasn't shown speaking, much like Red.\n\nIn the manga\n\nEthan, like most player characters, also has several counterparts in the various Pokémon manga series.\n\nIn Pokémon Adventures manga\n\nEthan's Pokémon Adventures counterpart, Gold\n\nGold from the Pokémon Adventures is based on Ethan.\n\nIn Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga\n\nThe main character, Gold, in Pokémon Gold & Silver: The Golden Boys manga is based on Ethan.\n\nIn Pokémon HeartGold SoulSilver: Pokédex Completion Comic manga\n\nSoul from Pokémon HeartGold SoulSilver: Pokédex Completion Comic is based on Ethan.\n\nIn the Pocket Monsters HeartGold & SoulSilver Go!

  "latent_9065": "In wielding executive power in these ways, Mr. Trump would be following in the footsteps of his predecessors. President Bush cited his commander in chief powers in order to justify interrogation, surveillance and detention polices in the wake of Sept. 11. While Mr. Obama has shied away from Mr. Bush’s constitutional arguments, he has interpreted statutes aggressively, while also relying on constitutional authorities, to justify the military intervention in Libya in 2011 and his nonenforcement of immigration laws.\n\nMr. Trump has expressed impatience with his critics and hinted that he would use federal powers against them. He wouldn’t be able to put someone in jail merely for criticizing him. But he could direct agencies to use their vast regulatory powers against the companies of executives who have displeased him, like Jeff Bezos, for example, the founder of Amazon. Mr. Trump has already hinted that he would go after Amazon for supposed antitrust violations.\n\nHe could direct the Department of Justice to investigate his critics by prioritizing categories of crimes they may have committed. Political opponents could be accused of campaign finance law violations. Former government officials, like Hillary Clinton, could be accused of violating secrecy laws. Even if the charges come to nothing, the legal fees for defendants will be hefty.\n\nMr. Trump could also crack down on journalists who report on national security issues by enforcing federal secrecy laws more aggressively than previous presidents. President Obama received a lot of criticism for prosecuting government employees who leaked secrets, but the Justice Department did not bring charges against the journalists who published the leaked information.\n\nWhat couldn’t Mr. Trump do? He couldn’t lower (or raise) taxes on his own. He’s supposed to spend funds that Congress appropriates and for the things that Congress appropriates them for — that’s what stands in the way of the wall (unless he persuades Mexico to pay for it and construct it on the other side of the border).\n\nHe could not follow through on his promise to impose the death penalty on killers of police officers by executive order. And even where he does act, he needs to make sure his legal theories are in order. If he wanted to withdraw climate regulations because climate change is a hoax perpetuated by China, no court would allow him to. But if he said that the climate regulations were based on a speculative assessment of harms that wouldn’t occur for 100 years, he could succeed.\n\nMuch depends on how far Mr. Trump is willing to push existing legal understandings. There is a netherworld of laws that presidents are supposed to comply with but courts don’t enforce. He could send military forces into a foreign country without authorization from Congress; courts would most likely stay out of the dispute. What of his suggestion earlier this year to kill the families of terrorists? Courts typically defer to the executive on matters concerning military activities abroad. He might even try to withhold appropriated funds or shift them around in defiance of Congress’s wishes.",
  "latent_9144": "Undeterred by growing voter resistance to a European Union whose borders are pushing ever eastward and soon possibly even further into the North Atlantic, the European Commission in Brussels and individual EU member states are currently working on plans for a further accession round.\n\nAccording to the current plan, at least five new member states could join the EU by 2014. Accession negotiations with Croatia may be completed as early as next year. Should that happen, the Balkan nation could become an EU member in 2011. Iceland, crisis-riddled and deeply indebted as it is, wouldn't be much further behind.\n\nOn Thursday and Friday, EU heads of state and goverment will be in Brussels for their December summit. During the meeting, they are expected to set a date for the start of formal membership negotiations with Macedonia. The Greek government in Athens is still trying to block negotiations over a name dispute with Macedonia, which is also the name of a region in Greece. But it is unlikely Athens will be able to secure much more than a modest delay in opening talks with its neighbor.\n\nEven Faster\n\nEfforts to reach a deal on an \"interim treaty\" with Serbia are also on the summit agenda, and official accession talks are expected to commence soon thereafter. Neighboring Montenegro is also expected to join the lineup for accession negotiations soon.\n\nSome EU leaders would like to see expansion come even faster. Athens' new socialist prime minister, Georgios Papandreou, and his Italian counterpart Silvio Berlusconi, would like to see the accession of the entire Western Balkens by 2014, including Bosnia-Herzegovina and Albania. That would be the only way to prevent further ethnic tensions in the region, they argue. But for many EU member states, expansion would be expensive. Net payers -- the countries that pay more into EU coffers than they receive back, including Germany -- would be required to significantly increase the amount they pay to Brussels each year.\n\nThe move would also further delay the aspirations of Turkey, which has been a candidate for many years, to become part of the EU. But Ankara already seems resigned to that fact. In a recent interview with the US weekly Newsweek, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu mentioned what he thought was the realistic date for Turkish accession to the EU: 2023.",
  "latent_9150": "Special counsel’s team and Eric Schneiderman’s office have reportedly shared evidence in move some see as way to create leverage for Manafort’s cooperation\n\nSpecial counsel Robert Mueller’s team is working with the New York attorney general, Eric Schneiderman, on its investigation into Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, Politico reported on Wednesday.\n\nFelix Sater: the enigmatic businessman at the heart of the Trump-Russia inquiry Read more\n\nCiting unnamed people familiar with the matter, Politico reported that Mueller’s team, investigating possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, and Schneiderman’s aides have shared evidence and talked frequently about a potential case in recent weeks.\n\nThe Associated Press, meanwhile, reported that a grand jury used by Mueller has heard secret testimony from Rinat Akhmetsin, a Russian American lobbyist who attended a June 2016 meeting with Trump’s eldest son at Trump Tower in Manhattan.\n\nThe cooperation between Mueller and Schneiderman “could potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trump’s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes”, Politico reported.\n\nCNN reported on Tuesday that Mueller had issued subpoenas to an attorney who formerly represented Manafort and to a Manafort spokesman.\n\nManafort’s Virginia apartment was raided by agents with the FBI last month. The longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with Mueller’s work have said.\n\nPolitico said no decision had been made on whether to file charges, and quoted one of the sources as saying: “Nothing is imminent.”\n\nMueller’s team has been looking into Manafort’s lobbying work and financial transactions, including real estate deals in New York. Manafort, who led Republican Trump’s campaign for several months in 2016, has not been accused of any wrongdoing.\n\nSchneiderman, a Democrat, said in May that Trump’s firing of former FBI director James Comey threatened the integrity of the agency. Trump has called Schneiderman, who brought one of the lawsuits over Trump University that were settled for $25m in 2016, a “lightweight”.\n\nRussia has denied any meddling in the 2016 US election. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as witch-hunt.\n\nA person familiar with the work of the grand jury used by Mueller confirmed to the AP that Akhmetshin had appeared before Mueller’s grand jury in recent weeks. The person spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss the secret proceedings.\n\nThe revelation is the clearest indication yet that Mueller and his team of investigators view the meeting, which came weeks after Trump secured the Republican presidential nomination, as a relevant inquiry point in their broader probe into Russian interference in the 2016 election.\n\nThe meeting included Donald Trump Jr; the president’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner; and Manafort. Emails released by Trump Jr show he took the meeting expecting that he would be receiving damaging information about Hillary Clinton as part of what was described to him as a Russian government effort to aid the Trump campaign.\n\nThe Financial Times first reported Akhmetshin’s grand jury appearance. Reached by the AP, Akhmetshin declined comment. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, also declined comment on Wednesday night.\n\nAkhmetshin spoke at length about his involvement in the Trump Tower meeting in an interview with the AP last month. A former Soviet military officer who served in a counterintelligence unit, he is also a well-known Washington lobbyist. He has been representing Russian interests trying to undermine the story of lawyer Sergei Magnitsky, who died in a Russian prison and is the namesake of a US sanctions law.\n\nAkhmetshin has been reported to have ties to Russian intelligence but he has denied that, calling the allegations a “smear campaign”.\n\nTrump makes policy pledge to senator investigating son's Russia meeting Read more\n\nMueller and his team first signaled their interest in the Trump Tower meeting last month by contacting an attorney for at least some of the Russians who attended. The meeting was disclosed earlier this year to Congress and first revealed by The New York Times.\n\nTrump Jr first said – in a statement reportedly drafted in part by his father – the purpose of the meeting was to discuss adoption but later acknowledged that he anticipated receiving information that he thought could be damaging to Clinton.\n\nIn addition to Akhmetshin, other attendees at the meeting included Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya; music publicist Rob Goldstone, who helped arrange the gathering; and a translator. Ike Kaveladze, who also goes by the name Irakly Kaveladze, also attended. He works for a Russian developer who once partnered with Trump to bring the Miss Universe pageant to Moscow.\n\nAn email exchange posted to Twitter by Trump Jr showed him conversing with Goldstone, who wanted him to meet with someone he described as a “Russian government attorney”, who supposedly had dirt on Clinton as “part of Russia and its government’s support for Mr Trump”.\n\n“If it’s what you say I love it especially later in the summer,” Trump Jr wrote in one email response.",
  "latent_9186": "Written by evilweevil666 with contributions from Turkis and Hectares.\n\nPalladium Simulacrum is one of a just a handful of creatures that can cover multiple lanes and also stand alone. While SolForge has a variety of lane filling cards such as Ether Hounds, Brighttusk Sower, and Branchweaver Druid, they are largely unplayable without the synergy provided by other cards like Tarsus Deathweaver or Spring Dryad. Simulacrum, while still able to take advantage of such synergies, has a growth curve that allows it to stand on its own like Echowisp and Esperian Scarab. Compared to these cards, however, Palladium Simulacrum avoids pitfalls such as requiring two adjacent empty lanes or specific faction combinations.\n\nThis is not to say that Palladium Simulacrum does not have its own limitations. Most obviously, at level 1 (L1) it should only be placed in the center lane. However, at L2 and L3 Simulacrum turns its main limitation into a potential engine to be exploited. The impressive power of the Palladium Simulacrum is hidden behind subtle wording of the card – the text “from your hand” is absent. This means that with mobility the Simulacrum can move in and out of the center lane, repeatedly creating a second creature.\n\nMobility also mitigates the hindrance of the Simulacrum’s restrictions. Even if the middle lane is not available, the card can be placed in a different lane and slide over when it becomes free. Generating the copy in a random lane may also seem to be a problem on par with Echowisp’s adjacent lane restriction, but mobility can often nullify this. On an empty board, if you place an L2 Simulacrum in the center lane, there is a 50% chance the copy will be in a position to immediately move into the center next turn. And of course, at L3 Palladium Simulacrum can reach the center from anywhere on the field.\n\nAn important aspect to look at in evaluating any creature’s potential is the resistance to common removal options. In the case of a multi-lane creature, this often comes down to vulnerability to Epidemic, as this is the most commonly seen multi-lane removal spell in SolForge. As with Echowisp and Esperian Scarab, the Palladium Simulacrum is vulnerable to an on-level Epidemic at player level 1 (PL1) and PL2. However, unlike these cards, the Simulacrum outstrips Epidemic at PL3. This facet greatly enhances its utility in the late-game. If an opponent is not able to remove both Simulacra you will likely deal significant damage and generate a new copy. In addition, your opponent will often be tempted to level Epidemic as it deals with Simulacrum so efficiently. By doing so your opponent will be stuck prioritizing a card that will do very little in PL3.\n\nA multi-lane, mobile, Alloyin threat can pair with any faction. The Alloyin/Nekrium list below takes full advantage of the not-played-from-hand aspect of the Simulacrum proc and is just one of many ways to build around the card. Other considerations include Uterra grow-wide, Tempys mobility, other Alloyin/Nekrium brews, and even Mono Alloyin deck control.\n\nNA Palladium Weavers Core:\n\n3x Palladium Simulacrum\n\n3x Tarsus Deathweaver\n\n3x Varna’s Pact\n\n3x Shallow Grave Creatures:\n\n3x Ebonskull Knight\n\n3x Grimgaunt Devourer\n\n3x Aetherforge Oracle\n\n2x Cercee, Hand of Varna Spells:\n\n3x Epidemic\n\n2x Cull the Weak\n\n2x Overwhelming Force\n\nThe above deck is a take on a variant of NA Tarsus that has been seen in constructed queues since the addition of Aetherforge Oracle in Set 2.1. Aetherforge Oracle provides a spell leveling engine that becomes quite powerful when combined with Varna’s Pact and Shallow Grave, with the upside of multiple triggers when brought back with Varna’s Pact.\n\nPalladium Simulacrum slots into this deck due to its synergy with many of the core cards. Varna’s Pact helps protect an early Simulacrum play against Epidemic or other removal. This synergy creates a more aggressive shell for the AN Tarsus decks that have been run in the queue recently. Aggressive play makes Varna’s Pact, Shallow Grave, and Tarsus stronger while still providing a threat in the Simulacrum that is strong in the absence of all three.",

  "latent_9705": "Director of National Intelligence James Clapper testifying on Capitol Hill in Washington last Thursday before the Senate Armed Services Committee. AP Photo/Evan Vucci The Director of National Intelligence on Wednesday night announced that he had spoken with President-elect Donald Trump about an unverified report that Russia had incriminating personal and financial information about Trump.\n\nJames Clapper released a statement saying he had informed Trump that the US intelligence community \"has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable.\"\n\nTrump — who has not acknowledged whether he was presented with a summary of the document during the intelligence briefing he was given on Russian hacking last Friday — tweeted on Thursday morning that Clapper called him on Wednesday \"to denounce the false and fictitious report that was illegally circulated.\"\n\nBut Clapper, in the statement he released Wednesday night about the dossier's leak to the media, appeared to confirm that Trump was made aware of the dossier's existence and that the dossier itself was a matter of national security.\n\n\"The IC,\" or intelligence community, \"has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions\" that Russia attempted to sway the outcome of the presidential election in Trump's favor, Clapper wrote. \"However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.\"\n\nCNN reported on Tuesday that a two-page summary of the dossier, which contained memos documenting unconfirmed details linking Trump to the Russian government, had been included in a classified report on Russian meddling in domestic political affairs that was presented to President Barack Obama last Thursday and to Trump on Friday.\n\nFormer CIA operatives and analysts who spoke with Business Insider on Wednesday said the CIA and the FBI would not have briefed the president and the president-elect on claims that Russia had compromising information on Trump if they were not taking the allegations seriously.\n\n\"The intel community is not in the business of reporting vague rumors,\" Glenn Carle, who served 23 years in the CIA as the deputy national intelligence officer for transnational threats, said in an interview.\n\n\"They clearly considered it, in its aggregate, so serious — meaning plausible, but perhaps unproven — that they briefed only the top eight officials in the US government, known as the Gang of Eight,\" Carle added. \"It was considered that sensitive.\"\n\nThe 35-page dossier, published in full by BuzzFeed on Tuesday, included unverified claims that Trump cooperated with Russia in operations that targeted Trump's political opponents.\n\nClapper said in his statement that he told Trump he was \"dismayed\" that details from the dossier had been published by the press. He said that making the dossier public had been \"corrosive and damaging to our national security\" and that he reassured Trump that he did not think US intelligence agencies leaked the documents to the press.\n\nThe dossier has apparently been circulating among journalists and top lawmakers since early last year. Sen. John McCain of Arizona obtained a copy that he handed over to the FBI before the election. Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada obtained an early copy of the dossier as well.\n\nTrump had been engaged in a one-sided battle with the US intelligence community — mostly on Twitter— for some weeks after the CIA concluded that Russian agents employed cyberattacks to boost Trump and damage the Democratic Party and Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential election.\n\nSome US intelligence veterans have said the president-elect's tantrums against their organizations are troubling. Former CIA Director Leon Panetta last week said of Trump's conduct: \"This is just unheard of and unprecedented.\"\n\nThis evening, I had the opportunity to speak with President-elect Donald Trump to discuss recent media reports about our briefing last Friday. I expressed my profound dismay at the leaks that have been appearing in the press, and we both agreed that they are extremely corrosive and damaging to our national security.\n\nWe also discussed the private security company document, which was widely circulated in recent months among the media, members of Congress and Congressional staff even before the IC became aware of it. I emphasized that this document is not a U.S. Intelligence Community product and that I do not believe the leaks came from within the IC. The IC has not made any judgment that the information in this document is reliable, and we did not rely upon it in any way for our conclusions. However, part of our obligation is to ensure that policymakers are provided with the fullest possible picture of any matters that might affect national security.\n\nPresident-elect Trump again affirmed his appreciation for all the men and women serving in the Intelligence Community, and I assured him that the IC stands ready to serve his Administration and the American people.\n\nJames R.

  "latent_9768": "The veteran peace campaigner Brian Haw faces eviction from an area of grass in Parliament Square Gardens after losing an attempt to launch a legal challenge against a possession order granted to the mayor of London.\n\nHaw's longstanding presence on the pavement on the east side of Parliament Square is not, however, threatened by the order, which relates to his encroachment on to a small adjoining part of the gardens where he has pitched a tent. Haw has come under pressure to quit his decade-old protest just metres from Westminster Abbey as the royal wedding approaches.\n\nAfter the appeal attempt was lost, co-campaigner Barbara Tucker said she did not believe the eviction had anything to do with clearing the area for the royal wedding – \"it is about getting rid of our peace campaign\".\n\nLast month, the mayor, Boris Johnson, won a high court possession order to evict Haw and Tucker.\n\nRejecting the application at the court of appeal, the master of the rolls, Lord Neuberger, and Lady Justice Smith ruled there was \"no prospect\" of any appeal being successful. They said the mayor was entitled to his order for possession without any further delay as \"justice delayed is justice denied\".\n\nTucker interrupted Neuberger as he gave his judgment, saying: \"This is a cover-up. Are you finished now?\"\n\nShe and several supporters walked out of court as Smith announced that she agreed the application should be dismissed. Haw is being treated for lung cancer in Germany.\n\nMr Justice Wyn Williams last month granted an order for possession and an injunction against Haw, from Redditch, Worcestershire, and Tucker, but the orders were not to be put in place until after any appeal.\n\nAll Haw and Tucker have to do now, however, having lost the right to appeal, is to move their tents from the green, owned by the Greater London Authority, to the pavement, which is owned by Westminster council.\n\nThe prime minister, the home secretary and the mayor of London have all vowed to clear the pavement of protesters before Kate Middleton and Prince William marry on 29 April, but so far have found no legal power that allows them to do so.\n\nThe high court judge ruled: \"Parliament Square Gardens [PSG] is not a suitable location for prolonged camping; such camping is incompatible with the function, lawful use and character of PSG and it is also inconsistent with the proper management of the area as a whole.\"\n\nHe said the campaigners' tents and placards were occupying more space than was permitted.

You can also update it to the latest software - iOS 12.\n\nApple's iPhone 6S pitch was 'the only thing that's changed is everything', highlighting that it knows this is phone looks an awful lot like the previous model.\n\nIt makes sense that Apple would try its hardest to show that, despite the handset looking identical to the iPhone 6, there have been loads of changes under the hood that make this an attractive phone in its own right.\n\nThe chassis is stronger, the camera sharper – with a new Harry Potter-esque way of capturing your snaps – and there's even a completely new way of interacting with the screen. On paper, it's an impressive upgrade.\n\nOf course, it's also getting on a bit now. So much so that Apple itself no longer sells the iPhone 6S. By iPhone standards it can be considered a budget option - and that may suit you, especially as it's still a solid handset, as this review shows - but if you're more after the latest and greatest iPhone you might want to consider the iPhone XS or iPhone XS Max.\n\nOr split the difference and pick up the iPhone XR - a new handset but one which is lower end than the XS range (though still packing newer tech and features than the iPhone 6S.\n\nIf you do go for the iPhone 6S then you're looking at prices of around $370 / £300 / AU$630 for a 32GB model, which at the time of writing seems to be the most widely available model if you're hoping to buy new rather than refurbished. There are also 16GB, 64GB and 128GB versions though.\n\nThose prices mean the iPhone 6S sits in the lower mid-range now, but it's still quite pricey for a handset that came out in 2015, so if you're not set on Apple you might also want to consider some Android alternatives, such as the Honor 10, which offers a lot more power for not vastly more money.\n\nOf course, you miss out on iOS and Apple's App Store, among other things. You'll find our original review below, covering all the key features.\n\niPhone 6S specs Weight: 143g\n\nDimension: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm\n\nOS: iOS 9 (upgrades to iOS 12)\n\nScreen size: 4.7-inch\n\nResolution: 750 x 1334\n\nCPU: Apple A9\n\nRAM: 2GB\n\nStorage: 16/32/64/128GB\n\nBattery: 1715mAh\n\nRear camera: 12MP\n\nFront camera: 5MP\n\nRead our in-depth iPhone XS review\n\nDesign\n\nThe iPhone 6S is almost identical to the 6 in every way when it comes to the chassis. There are some very subtle differences, such as a slightly thicker frame and a little more heft, but it's so slight that I kept getting the two mixed up when doing side by side comparisons.\n\nAll cases fit both phones just fine too so, apart from a small S logo on the back of the phone, nobody is going to notice you've got the latest iPhone.\n\nBut there will be lots of you upgrading from the iPhone 5S, and in that case you'll need to be ready for a really big design change. The metallic chassis feels really nice in the hand, with a ceramic-like feeling on the outside (although if it's anything like the 6 then this can scuff over time if you keep it in a pocket with keys, so you'll need to think about the kind of case you'll want to keep it safe).\n\nIf you're not ready to take the leap to the new, bigger form factor, Apple has the new iPhone SE to satisfy your 4-inch cravings.\n\nOne of the things that Apple is touting is the fact the iPhone 6S is made of 7000 series aluminum, which is the strongest thing it's ever used in iPhone construction. The obvious connection people will make is with 'Bendgate', when some users claimed their new phone had developed a slight curve in their pocket without much pressure.\n\nThe common belief was that these phones began to twist when placed in a rear pocket and sat upon. While it was proven that other metal phones actually were worse when it came to bending Apple didn't come out of the controversy well.\n\nSo it's no surprise that, while the company won't admit the real reason, the new iPhone is strong and never going to bend with such pressure. However, I feel like that we shouldn't feel happy our phones no longer bend – this seems like one of the minimum expectations I'd have of a smartphone, not a compelling reason to buy it.\n\nThe front of the phone is now covered in a new level of strength, with a glass that's far less prone to shattering when dropped on the floor – now that's something I can get behind. We've not drop tested it - we'll leave that to some other, braver reviewer - if the screen is stronger the responsiveness hasn't dropped.\n\nIn the hand, the iPhone 6S still feels like a dream. Even with the extra 14g over the iPhone it feels lightweight, easy to manipulate and really warrants the price. Samsung's similarly old Galaxy S7 Edge invokes the same kind of feeling, and with it you don't mind spending the extra money over a more budget phone.\n\nIn terms of design, if you've seen the iPhone 6 then you've seen the 6S. The volume buttons, the power key, the silencer switch and the speaker are all in the same place as its predecessor, with the grille at the bottom very easy to cover when you're watching videos or playing games in landscape.\n\nIf you're using the 5S, this is leagues ahead. The construction is good, the materials solid and there's no wiggle in the buttons at all. While you probably never bent your 5S, the idea that the iPhone 6S is stronger will probably please you, however unnecessary the claim is.\n\nApple's not done anything great with the design of the iPhone 6S, but the iPhone 6 was such a well-created phone that using the same chassis isn't going to harm its chances of success.\n\nHowever, combined with the higher price and the continued presence of the iPhone 6, I wish we were at least seeing some retooling of the phone to make it seem more attractive.\n\nScreen\n\nThe screen on the iPhone 6S seems to be identical to the iPhone 6's: we're talking a 4.7-inch affair with 750p resolution, which keeps it firmly in the 'Retina' range that the firm debuted all the way back with the iPhone 4.\n\nIt's hard to rate the display, as while it fails on resolution (quite spectacularly actually - phones a seventh the cost of the iPhone 6S offer 1080p screens, Samsung's cheaper phone has four times the resolution of the 6S and Sony has, inexplicably, launched a 4K phone) it doesn't drop too badly on performance.\n\nThe iPhone 6S display is clear, bright, laminated to the glass and insanely colorful. The first time I saw it on the iPhone 6 I thought it was a fake picture stuck on top of a dummy unit, such was the clarity on offer.\n\nSo to use the same thing on the iPhone 6S makes sense - after all, the lower pixel count means it can be thinner and the battery can last longer, thanks to having fewer pixels to drive.\n\nBut there are some things missing: for instance, the contrast ratio (the difference between the brightest and darkest parts of the screen) is still poor, with the black areas looking a little grey. Samsung's Galaxy range predominantly uses OLED technology, which offers 'true' blacks and high brightness and packs a much better visual punch, and would have suited the iPhone down to the ground.\n\nThe sharpness in side by side tests is clearly lower too - the 326 pixels per inch is very low even compared the 401ppi of the iPhone 6S Plus - and most other models are over 500ppi to bring really, really clear displays.\n\nGiven OLED technology is used in the Apple Watch - and admittedly it looks brilliant - it's a shame the same thing couldn't have been done with the iPhone 6S.\n\nIt's important not to get too hung up on screen resolution in a phone - after all, if it's not serving a purpose (hey, Sony?) then it's just wasting battery. But the industry has moved on, and the higher pixel densities on offer are starting to really bring something to the table, with apps and general use looking pin sharp.",

Sign in or Sign up today!\n\nDETROIT (ChurchMilitant.com) - Father James Martin is saying that chastity is not required of homosexuals. In a video posted on YouTube on September 20, the Jesuit claims the Church's teaching on chastity is not binding on the consciences of the faithful because it has not been \"received\" by the people. It's a denial of the infallible teaching authority of the Catholic Church in matters of both faith and morals.\n\nHe also said in a post on Facebook, \"Things can always improve. And the Holy Spirit knows what She's doing\" (emphasis added).\n\n\"For a teaching to be really authoritative,\" he said, \"it is expected that it will be received by the people of God, by the faithful. So you look at something like say, the Assumption. So the Assumption is declared and people accept that. They go to the feast of the Assumption, they believe in the Assumption, it's received.\"\n\n\"The teaching that LGBT people must be celibate their entire lives,\" he continued, \"has not been received.\"\n\nIn other words, Martin is pushing the protestant notion that teaching only becomes magisterial if the people \"receive\" the teaching. Because the LGBT community has not \"received\" the requirement of chastity, therefore that teaching is not authoritative, and thus has no application to them.\n\nThe Code of Canon law in paragraph 750 reads:\n\nA person must believe with divine and Catholic faith all those things contained in the word of God, written or handed on, that is, in the one deposit of faith entrusted to the Church, and at the same time proposed as divinely revealed either by the solemn Magisterium of the Church or by its ordinary and universal Magisterium, which is manifested by the common adherence of the Christian faithful under the leadership of the sacred Magisterium; therefore all are bound to avoid any doctrines whatsoever contrary to them.\n\nSection 2 goes on to read:\n\nEach and every thing which is proposed definitively by the magisterium of the Church concerning the doctrine of faith and morals, that is, each and every thing which is required to safeguard reverently and to expound faithfully the same deposit of faith, is also to be firmly embraced and retained; therefore, one who rejects those propositions which are to be held definitively is opposed to the doctrine of the Catholic Church.\n\nVatican II teaches in Lumen Gentium that the definitions of the Catholic Church \"must be adhered to with the submission of faith.\" This teaching is referenced in the Catechism of the Catholic Church in paragraph 892.\n\nAt Vatican I, Bd. Pope Pius IX declared at Vatican I: \"Likewise I accept Sacred Scripture according to that sense which Holy mother Church held and holds, since it is her right to judge of the true sense and interpretation of the Holy Scriptures; nor will I ever receive and interpret them except according to the unanimous consent of the fathers.\"\n\nMartin has implied in past tweets that the Church doesn't teach authoritatively, placing the words \"Church teaching\" in scare quotes.\n\nAnd in a different video, the pro-gay priest has said going to a gay wedding is no worse than going to a Jewish wedding, referring to it as \"a different tradition,\" adding that refusing to attend a gay wedding is \"very surprising to me.\"\n\nThe Catholic Church teaches that a marriage outside the Church between non-baptized persons and without impediments of natural law is considered a natural marriage, and thus a lawful marriage in the eyes of God. No sin is committed in such a union. A so-called same-sex marriage involves both an impediment of natural law as well as mortal sin — in fact, among the four sins that cry out to Heaven for vengeance because of their gravity and deep offensiveness to God.\n\nFr. Martin to active gays about to be wed: 'Your love is beautiful.'\n\nFather Martin was speaking to a homosexual person who said he was planning his \"wedding\" and whose lifestyle had previously been opposed by his parents but who now plans on walking him down the aisle.\n\n\"God did give them the grace to come to see you, it's conversion, metanoia, conversion of mind and heart,\" he remarkked, \"so I think that's beautiful, it's a great story that they can celebrate with you. Your love is beautiful.\"\n\nFather Martin said of the parents' change of mind: \"How could Jesus not take joy in what you just told me?\"\n\nThese outbursts by Fr. Martin follow on a series of cancellations of speeches including at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. The priest published a string of tweets on September 15 blaming the cancellations on \"campaigns\" by Church Militant and other Catholic sites. Both secular and establishment Catholic media came to his defense, including The New York Times, which published an article with the headline \"Jesuit Priest Stands Up for Gay Catholics, Then Faces Backlash.\"\n\nThe Paulist Fathers published a letter on September 20 supporting Fr. Martin, saying that the CUA cancellation \"exposes the ugliness of homophobia and intolerance in our Church and society.\" The Mother Church of the Paulist Fathers, Saint Paul the Apostle in New York City, has a notorious gay ministry called Out at Saint Paul. Out at Saint Paul in June of 2016 posted a photo to their Facebook page featuring an outdoor Mass with a rainbow flag draped over the altar.\n\nOn September 18, pro-gay Bishop Robert McElroy of the Diocese of San Diego wrote an op-ed in America magazine, where Fr. Martin is editor-at-large, coming to the defense of the celebrity Jesuit. In the article Bp. McElroy called orthodox Catholics a \"cancer\" in the Church.\n\nAnd liberal Catholic outlet Commonweal published an article on September 19 titled \"The Real Scandal: What Attacks on James Martin Say about the U.S. Church,\" which referred to Church Militant as \"self-appointed guardians of orthodoxy.\"\n\nChurch Militant went over these developments on the September 18 episode of The Download.\n\nHave a news tip?

I commend the organization and its membership for drawing an interest in what I consider an invaluable aspect of the pipe band ensemble: the midsection ( Or 'bass section' if you will - I prefer to include all members of the section using the latter term.) . Interest in this field is far overdue, and with liberal progressive movements never being more predominant in the field, we are able to see the expanding function and importance of the midsection within the pipe band ensemble. The following article hopes to increase reader awareness as to how important the midsection is in the development of a band's ensemble in relation to these movements. I have been asked to discuss the aspect of tuning within the pipe band midsection. Prior to moving forward, we must first understand (as we know with our three droned friends at the front of the band) that in music tuning is simply a given. In other words, a player would not even attempt show up to a band or orchestra unless his instrument is in tune with itself. The problem has been that historically, the midsection did not have the same function it does today, and often tuning within the section was paradoxically simply a 'function of little function'. If we look at the role of the midsection historically as the primary timekeeper, we know that time is the foundation behind all rhythmic structures and variations found in the melody and the snare drum accompaniment. In a sense, the playing of time by the midsection was one means of 'bridging' the two sections together, by providing a solid rhythmic support (or foundation) to everything else overlying it. In today's pipe band ensemble this aspect of 'bridging' has taken on an additional dimension not only through the playing of a solid foundation of time, but through the playing of rhythmic structures that ideally highlight key areas within both the melody and snare drum accompaniment. In fact, the integration of the visual component (or flourishes) within the ensemble should ideally take on the same function by creating a visual representation of the melody and snare drum accompaniment. This function of adding 'rhythmic colour' to the ensemble is now done through the use of more than just the traditional bass and tenor voices - possibly through the addition of further voices including baritone, alto, and soprano drums. Prior to performing any aspect of 'rhythmic accentuation' it is essential to understand how to tune our instruments to allow the latter roles of the midsection to bring the gap that much closer together. As previously mentioned, tuning should be a given - I am personally as anal about having my drum in tune with itself and the rest of the ensemble, as a bagpiper is in relation to his section! The wonderful thing is that it is not rocket science - anyone is fully capable of tuning his or her drum in relation to the bagpipe, assuming that the proper resources are in place in order to achieve it. The following article intends to provide the introductory processes associated with getting the midsection 'in tune with itself' and then 'in tune with the entire ensemble' so that the rhythmic (and visual) colour provided by the midsection can be effective in the context of today's pipe band. Ok... now where do we begin? Let's begin by understanding that bass and tenor drums can be tuned in relationship to the bagpipe. We are actually able to achieve absolute pitches from our instruments by having them in tune with themselves. But what does this mean? I am indebted to the scientific studies performed by Greg Bassani of the Australian Pipe Band College (1990) who has provided objective evidence that bass and tenor drums are capable of producing identifiable notes. I will use the latter study as factual support to the methodology we use in the 78th Frasers. Tuning bass and tenor drums to clear, identifiable pitches (or notes) allows us to tune harmonically to the bagpipe using various diameters of drums, and therefore provides greater depth to the pipe band ensemble. Historically, pipe band bass and tenor drums were tuned simply as a means of adding colour to the overall ensemble; to tune for colour is to tune to no particular pitch, note or frequency . Conversely, when something is tuned in relationship to something else it is being tuned for function . Within a pipe band, functional tuning makes the most sense by allowing the drums to blend in relation to the bagpipe. Generally, when an object is in tune with everything else around it, it will be most beneficial to the depth of ensemble and therefore provide one step closer to bridging the gap between sections. Imagine having the midsection highlight a rhythmic pattern in the snare drumming while using voicing arrangements that create harmonics overtop of the melody - now that's ensemble! Drums in tune with themselves... what do you mean by that? In order for the drums to produce an identifiable note, the drums must first be in tune with themselves - or more simply have both heads of equal tension. This means that each zone (or the area where each bolt is tightened) is tuned the same. When each tuning rod on both top and bottom drumheads is at the same tension, the fundamental pitch or note of the drum becomes the strongest and therefore definable by any chromatic tuner and the human ear. Tuning each zone by ear can be a tedious task; therefore, a Timpanic Measuring Device (TMD) is highly recommended. The device can be easily purchased from a local drum or music shop. Brands include Hosbilt* TMD (CA), and Drum Dial* (US,UK). The latter devices are not only an accurate representation of the tension in each zone, but they are also many times more efficient than the traditional 'tap' and 'listen' method - assuming that there is not anything obstructing the level of deflection under the head (such as strips of felt/dampening, or uneven bearing edges). Be wary of devices that measure the torque in each zone - any unmatched lubricity in each of the threaded counterparts (or lugs) and head fibers will also provide an inaccurate representation of the tension in each zone. A TMD can readily match these zones of tension identically by measuring the drumhead deflection in each zone. The number read by the device means absolutely nothing - it is simply a measure of the tension in each region of the drum. The goal is simply to have them all the same. Once this is done on both heads, the drum is then in tune with itself and at this stage, it will create a definable pitch when struck. Almost any chromatic electronic tuner can read this pitch - I personally recommend the Korg* DT-3 as an affordable device that readily does the trick. If the tuner cannot pick up the note (in other words, numerous random or inconsistent notes appear on the screen of the tuner), chances are there is more than one note being created at the same time from the drum. Your drum is therefore not in tune with itself. It will then be necessary to re-check each zone for equal tension. Ok.our drum is now in tune with itself and therefore producing a note of some kind.now how do we get it in tune with the other drum voices.or more importantly.the bagpipe? First we must examine what key the bagpipe is in. At one time an 'A' on the bagpipe was an 'A' in concert pitch, or in layman's terms - the note you would hit on a piano; however, that is clearly not the case today. An 'A' on the bagpipe today is now closer to a 'Bb' (a note halfway to the note of 'B'). This therefore makes it almost impossible to define the bagpipe within any particular key - it is not a concert instrument like the piano, but it also isn't a perfect 'Bb' instrument like the trumpet. To simplify the content of this article as much as possible, let's assume that the bagpipe is a perfect Bb instrument - this makes our role as functional tuners in the midsection initially that much easier. A 'Bb' on the piano we will assume matches the 'A' on the bagpipe. Figure 1.1: Bagpipe to Concert Pitch Conversion Table Note on Bagpipe Note in Concert Pitch (ie. Piano) High A Bb C D E F Low A Bb Bass Drone\n\nTenor Drone Bb\n\nBb (octave above) When bagpipe tunes are said to be in a 'major' key, then they are usually based harmonically on the chord of A, C and E in bagpipe pitch. Since a large majority of the pipe band music is written in this key, it makes sense to use these three notes when tuning the tenor drums in relation to the bagpipe. We will use the latter three notes as the foundation behind our tuning process. They relate in concert pitch to 'Bb', 'D', and 'F' in concert pitch, which will be important to know later. These notes can also be classified as the root, 3rd and 5th respectively. Using basic musical knowledge, we know that these three notes when played both on their own, or together, sound wonderful. Anyone who knows the musical theme to Star Wars can appreciate the strong relationship between these notes - particularly the strong relationship between the root (Bb) and the 5th (F) in the first bar of the composition. We can already imagine the impact of having not only strong harmonics (notes that work well together) within the midsection, but harmonics that also relate to the bagpipe. We can therefore already envision the 'gap' between sections already becoming smaller!\n\nFigure 1.2: A Bb Chord (Bb, D, F)\n\nVoice of Drum in Midsection Note (concert pitch) Bass Drum (28'' or 26\") Bb (octave below bass drone) Baritone Drum (18'') Bb (octave of bass drone) Tenor Drum (18\" or 16\") D (3rd of the chord of the bass drone) Alto Drum (16\" or 15'') F (5th of the chord of the bass drone) Soprano Drum (16\" or 15\") Bb (octave above bass drone, octave of tenor drone) A standard 28\" bass drum is most easily tuned to the Bb (which just happens to be in the octave below the bass drone contrary to popular belief). Historically we have heard the pitch of the bass drum being tuned lower than this frequency - possibly to the G or F below (remember, historically tuning was a 'function of little function'). As a result, this recommended note may initially seem high to the human ear by traditional standards. The functional tuning of the baritone, tenor, and alto drums in concert pitch are 'Bb', 'D', and 'F' respectively, in the same octave as the bass drone. Figure 1.3 provides a list of the voice of the drum and the recommended shell diameter for each of the latter pitches. If you are looking for a soprano voice in the mid-section, it is recommend that you tune to the 'Bb' in the octave above the baritone drum (or the actual octave of the tenor drone). If you have a sound musical background you may question why the 7th ('G') of the chord is not used instead. In my experience, the 7th often sounds unfinished within the chord and does not work well with the scale of the bagpipe, and is therefore not recommended for our purpose.\n\nOk.my drum is now in tune with itself.now what? Now that you know what note the drum is tuned to, it is only a matter of equally decreasing or increasing the tension in each zone to change the pitch until the required note is obtained (a TMD is no longer required since all zones are already at an equal tension). By using a chromatic tuner and striking the drum in a location free of extraneous noise, you will be able to acquire a reading that will determine how close you are to achieving your desired note. I recommend a publication of the Australian Pipe Band College, which offers a series of helpful guidelines to follow when using a tuner on bass and tenor drums. I continually check my tuning as my band practices, and prior to marching on the field when I hear the pitch of the bagpipe rising. A word of caution - black heads look wonderful but are deadly if you are trying to keep your drum in tune with the ensemble. Black attracts the sun, which causes the heads to change rapidly and drastically - I know from my own experience in our 'northern climate'. I can only imagine the difficulty experienced in your New Zealand sun during the summer competition season. Well, we have just touched on the topic of tuning in the pipe band midsection. Please remember that the methods I have outlined for you in this article are solely a guide - there are many different styles of tuning that have wonderful value in today's pipe band. What is important is that there is a 'method to our madness'.

  "latent_10317": "Although young voters are overwhelmingly liberal on social issues like gay marriage and drug legalization, new research released on Thursday suggests the opposite is true when it comes to abortion.\n\nPolling and research conducted by the Institute for Pro-Life Advancement, a newly launched initiative by Students for Life of America, found a majority of millennials support increasing restrictions on abortion, even if many of them do not identify as “pro-life.”\n\nThe survey found 53 percent of millennials believe abortion should be illegal in all or most circumstances, with 17 percent of young people responding abortion should never be legal and 36 percent only in extreme cases, such as rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at risk.\n\nThat figure is up 9 points since a 2012 survey conducted by Students for Life, which found 44 percent of 18- to 24-year-olds tended to back pro-life policies and 44 percent pro-choice ones.\n\nIn the most recent poll, only 17 percent of the up-and-coming generation said abortion should be legal at any point throughout a pregnancy — the position held by presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton and espoused by Planned Parenthood.\n\nDespite their pro-life policy preferences, only 36 percent of millennials self-identify as “pro-life,” compared to 48 percent who said they were more likely to identify as “pro-choice.”\n\nKristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life, said the problem with the pro-life movement is not with its ideas, but with the way it’s branded in the public square.\n\n“Over the past 10 years, the image of the pro-life movement has trended younger and more mainstream, but the ‘pro-life’ brand still carries an image which many people don’t want to associate themselves, despite their views on abortion,” Ms. Hawkins said in a statement.\n\n“Planned Parenthood would have the nation believe that young women are fighting with them on their extreme abortion agenda but that’s not the case,” she said.\n\nBecause of the confusion around the “pro-life” moniker, Students for Life said it stopped using the term in its campus advocacy. Instead, the group began asking questions that cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter, such as where lines on abortion should be drawn and why.\n\nIn addition to the polling, the Institute for Pro-Life Advancement issued several white papers examining how to bring millennials further into the pro-life fold.\n\nFaced with a similar brand problem, the pro-choice movement has made inroads in recent years marketing itself as pro-women. But researchers at the Institute for Pro-Life Advancement said abortion-rights advocates don’t have a monopoly on that market.\n\nPointing to Students for Life’s #WomenBetrayed campaign, researchers said the pro-life movement can appeal to millennials and centrists by pointing to the harm inflicted on women by abortion and continuing to expose unsavory practices at Planned Parenthood.\n\nIn the wake of the Center for Medical Progress video series, which caught top Planned Parenthood officials on tape discussing the abortion giant’s alleged fetal body parts trafficking operation, millennials are much less supportive of funding for Planned Parenthood.\n\nA plurality, 47 percent, said Planned Parenthood should still receive at least some funding, compared to 36 percent who said it should be curtailed. But the number of millennials supportive of Planned Parenthood is down by 19 points since last year, when a Quinnipiac University poll found 66 percent of young people supported taxpayer funding for the abortion provider.\n\n“When Americans see what happens behind the closed doors of Planned Parenthood facilities across the country, their support drops dramatically as they realize Planned Parenthood’s modus operandi is incongruous with the image they project of being an advocate for women’s health,” one of the white papers concludes.\n\nThe Institute for Pro-Life Advancement poll surveyed 803 millennials from Feb. 2-10. It has a margin of error of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC. Click here for reprint permission.",

  "latent_10433": "In this I-Team report, Chicago's rising murder rate in a new context, how the numbers of shooting deaths compare to the city's most notorious crime era, the one that has tarnished Chicago's reputation around the world for a century.\n\nThe surprising stats show the city is worse off now in the category of murder than at the height of the era that has driven Chicago's reputation for almost a century, Capone's \"gangland\" Chicago.\n\nLet's compare two months: January 1929, leading up to the St. Valentine's Day Massacre, and last month, January 2013. Forty-two people were killed in Chicago last month, the most in January since 2002, and far worse than the city's most notorious crime era at the end of the Roaring Twenties.\n\nEven though the image of Chicago, perpetuated by Hollywood over the years, was that mobsters routinely mowed down people on the streets, the crime stats tell a different story. January 2013's bloodshed has caught the attention of Chicagoans, politicians, the White House and people around the world.\n\nIn January 1929 there were 26 killings. Forty-two people were killed in Chicago last month, the most in January since 2002, and far worse than the city's most notorious crime era at the end of the Roaring Twenties.\n\nEven though the image of Chicago, perpetuated by Hollywood over the years, was that mobsters routinely mowed down people on the streets, the crime stats tell a different story. The figures from January 2013 are significantly higher than the January of Al Capone's most famous year.\n\nWith Friday's fatal gunshot attack on a vehicle on a Lake Shore Drive, February is starting as January left off. But if the current murder rate continues, February 2013 will far exceed February 1929, when there were 26 killings, and that number includes the attack known around the world, the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. In that single slaughter, seven people were lined up against a warehouse wall on North Clark Street and gunned down. It was a bootlegging dispute between North and South Side mob gangs.\n\nThat hasn't changed between then and now, as police today cite street gangs and drugs for the rise in killings.\n\nThe 42 murders in January is nowhere near the most ever in a month, but even that figure is not from the rat-a-tat-tat years. It is from the early 90s, when police also said a mix of gangs and drugs fueled the tremendous number of killings.\n\nIn January 1992 there were 77 murders in Chicago. That is the January record. Most of the murders then and this year were with guns. That was also the case in 1929.\n\nThere was no real gun control back in Capone's day. The first national firearms act wasn't signed until 1934. It required approval of the local police chief, federally registered fingerprints, federal background check and a $200 tax.",
  "latent_10463": "Hargeisa, the capital of the unrecognized state of Somaliland, is built into a depression in the middle of a desert; from nearly every point in town, a visitor looks up at a lip of baked orange hills and a blank sky. If he has arrived directly from the Somali capital of Mogadishu—as I did, during a recent reporting trip—the lack of armored vehicles and the sudden scarcity of guns are striking and welcome. When traffic halts, as it often does along Hargeisa’s cattle-clogged and barely policed streets, you don’t feel sudden panic that plainclothes militiamen or terrorists are about to surround you. In fact, Hargeisa hasn’t seen a major terror attack since 2008; one aid worker characterized his weekly security updates as “nothing you wouldn’t expect to see in a fairly large town.” Mogadishu is a city of checkpoints and high walls, bombed-out buildings, and occasional signs of recovery dispersed through the ruined landscape. Hargeisa, which sits inside Somalia’s internationally recognized borders—though you wouldn’t necessarily realize this while waiting to get your passport stamped at the airport—is the polar opposite, beginning with the fact that it’s a safe enough place for people to want to visit.\n\nI arrived the day before the opening of the city’s sixth annual international book fair, which attracted Italian journalists, Kenyan editors, British poets, and Somali-speaking scholars and writers from Britain, New York, and across the Horn of Africa. The book fair exemplifies Somaliland’s progression, from the site of a devastating civil war in the late 1980s and early 1990s, to an emerging democracy eager for international acceptance. “Recovering from a war is a longtime process,” said Ayan Mohammad, one of the fair’s chief organizers. “We have to put culture and literature on the agenda. . . . That’s how you create narratives within a society. We want to talk about our challenges and create links with the region and to the West.”\n\nThe fair’s headliner was Mohammad Warsame, popularly called Hadraawi, the most beloved living poet in the Somali language. Like Ismail Kadare or Gabriel García Márquez, he is a literary figure whose life and work reflect his nation’s upheavals. The socialist military dictator Siad Barre imprisoned him for five years in the 1970s for his anti-regime activities. Hadraawi later lived in exile in the United Kingdom, and then returned to Somaliland and reinvented himself as a kind of conservative mystic—a bearded, white-robed elder who grounded his lyrics in traditional language and themes and wrote about reviving a single national destiny for the Somali people. During his reading at the fair’s opening session, the audience, packed into a sweltering meeting hall, hung on every syllable—on his fast, propulsive sentences, lines ending in shouts and guttural whispers, and rhymes that the poet barely restrained himself from singing. Hadraawi spoke in Somali, but the fair’s bestseller was the first English-language collection of his poetry, recently published by the Italy-based Poetry Translation Centre.\n\nIn a poem called “The Killing of the She-Camel,” included in his new edition of translated works, Hadraawi offers a powerful metaphor, rooted in Somalia’s rich pastoral tradition, for the tragedy of Somalia’s decades of autocracy, war, and social and political disintegration:\n\nHow they came rushing to that place\n\nwhere the carcass of the she-camel lay,\n\nand what a commotion there was\n\nas each caught at her flesh\n\npair by pair clawed off their share\n\nfrying it in the glare of the sun\n\nand cramming down dry\n\nits crisp skin, crunching the bones.\n\nYou’d bare your teeth too to see\n\ntheir scattered followers come,\n\nstill cramped with greed, ravenous. . . .\n\nLittle of the poem seemed to apply to Somaliland, at least not on the day of the book fair, where writers from four continents swapped copies of their work. Hargeisa makes such events both culturally and logistically possible. At the fair’s opening session, Somalia’s chronic dysfunction didn’t seem like a national-level phenomenon. There appears to be nothing in the famously byzantine Somali clan system or in the traditional nomadic economy and social structure that precludes a functional, democratic state. Somaliland already has one, along with peace, normalcy, and almost no foreign militants.\n\nYet Somaliland represents a political and even moral challenge. Official statehood for Somaliland could derail Somalia’s fragile rebuilding process. But denying recognition may jeopardize one of the most remarkable experiments in modern African history.\n\nSomaliland declared independence from Somalia after the collapse of Barre’s government in 1991. No country recognizes it as an independent state. But since 1991, it has built itself into a de facto independent state, with its own currency, passports, military, and government. “We have had 22 years of peace,” one Hargeisa-based civil society activist told me. “All institutions are functioning. But Somaliland still has to insist on its independence.”\n\nSomaliland’s current status is partly a legacy of the colonial era and partly the result of Somalia’s troubled recent history. The majority-Somali section of the Horn of Africa is among the most ethnically, religiously, and culturally homogenous regions on the continent. But colonialism turned Somalis into a transnational group and complicated efforts at uniting them under a single flag. Modern-day Djibouti became a French coaling station. Present-day Somalia was part of Italy’s empire in East Africa, while Ethiopia incorporated Somali Ogaden into its borders. Britain held on to the Somali areas of present-day Kenya as well as modern-day Somaliland. In 1960, British and Italian holdings (not counting the Somali areas of soon-to-be-independent Kenya) merged into an independent Somalia—but for five days, the former British Somaliland was recognized as an independent state before uniting with the former Italian Somalia. Those five days, as well as the voluntary nature of the merger, remain the territory’s most concrete legal claim to independence.\n\nControversies swirled early on over Mogadishu’s legal jurisdiction over the north, but the north-south political cleavage became something more than a legalistic matter in 1988, during the opening days of the civil war that would eventually unseat Barre’s socialist-military government. That year, Barre’s air force practically leveled Hargeisa—an atrocity still raw in the minds of city residents.\n\nAfter 1991, Somalia and Somaliland radically diverged. In Somalia, Barre’s government collapsed. Within a few years, so did the U.S. and UN peacekeeping missions tasked with delivering humanitarian aid and keeping the country together. They failed, thanks to the infamous Black Hawk Down incident and an inability to grasp the country’s increasingly Hobbesian politics. After it became clear that outside forces could not impose stability on a fractious country in the grip of warlordism and clan-based conflict, the international community tried another tactic: financing endless rounds of peace conferences in cities throughout Africa and the Middle East. This didn’t work, either. As BBC Africa editor Mary Harper writes in her book Getting Somalia Wrong?, the “fantastically expensive” conferences were mostly useful for assuaging the organizers’ guilt: “Foreign powers could be seen as ‘doing something’ about Somalia without the risk of much direct involvement.” Islamist radicals briefly took control of Mogadishu, until a 2006 Ethiopian military invasion drove them out. By 2009, al-Qaida affiliate al-Shabaab had seized much of the country before African Union peacekeepers retook it. A famine the next year killed more than a quarter of a million people.\n\nFor years, then, Somalia has been a collapsed state—one located along a globally vital shipping lane. So during the course of three presidential administrations, the United States’ chief goal in the country has been the establishment of a Mogadishu-based federal government, a worryingly reversible objective realized only in mid-2012. The continued survival of al-Shabaab, as well as events like the group’s deadly September 2013 attack on a Nairobi shopping mall, only highlighted the urgency of establishing a functional state.\n\nBy contrast, after declaring independence, Somaliland was left on its own. Its peace process was organic, uninfluenced by the resources, expectations, or military adventures of outsiders. “The peace-building came from us,” says Shukri Ismail, Somaliland’s minister of agriculture and the environment. “People contributed food, cash—the peace process came out of their own pockets. There was no support from the international community.”\n\nSomalilanders slowly constructed a political order that could accommodate the existing social organization. Ismail says that accountability to traditional family- and clan-based leadership structures proved crucial to success. This was something that the former Italian Somalia lacked, according to Ayan Mohammad. “The British never interfered with our customs,” she says. “In Somalia, Italian fascism destroyed the local social structure. After the civil war, there was nothing to fall back on.”\n\nTribalism in Somaliland has not produced violent divisions, as it has in southern Somalia or in Afghanistan and Iraq. An unelected House of Elders formalizes the involvement of the country’s clans in the political system. But most of Somaliland’s political power is located in its executive branch. Clannism is an informal balancing mechanism: clans constitute a base of power for certain political parties, and the necessities of the clan system provide a rough guide for apportioning ministerial jobs. Somaliland’s politics operate in a way that accommodates clannism while limiting its official influence. Traditionalism is not necessarily the enemy of democracy or of the formal political system. As one Hargeisa-based expert told me, Somalilanders “never openly institutionalized the clan system,” even if it serves as a medium of the country’s politics.\n\nSomaliland has held six democratic elections since 1992. The most recent one, in 2010, resulted in perhaps the first democratic transition of power in the Horn of Africa’s modern history. The uniforms are flimsy, and the insignia have a clip-art quality, but military, police, and customs services all exist. Political culture has moved past the embryonic stage. In Somalia, it’s unclear what form the state will take, or even what territory it will rule over—or whether Mogadishu’s devastated government quarter will ever be rebuilt. In Somaliland, there is talk of directly electing the upper house of parliament (the House of Elders, similar to the House of Lords) and of the need for women in government, and there are even signs that ideologically based political parties are emerging, a crucial development that could transform the political system. Opposition leader Faisal Ali, who finished third in the last presidential election, presides over a moderate leftist party that belongs to the Socialist International. He complained to me about parties whose “agenda was just to sit on the chair” and hold power.\n\nSomaliland’s economy is far from diversified. According to experts I spoke with, 80 percent of the territory’s population has some connection to pastoralism, while remittances and investment from the Somali diaspora represent nearly half of its economic activity. Contraband industries thrive, particularly a trade in charcoal that threatens to wipe out Somaliland’s remaining forests. But between livestock, remittances, and banking—the area has become the center of a globally powerful money-transfer industry, thanks chiefly to Dahabshiil, an Islamic bank founded by Somalilanders—Somaliland has enough of a private sector to justify the parliament’s passage of formal banking regulations this past year. Dahabshiil now issues debit cards accepted throughout Hargeisa. The bank even claims to pay taxes directly to Somaliland’s government.\n\nSomaliland’s ambiguous status denies it certain economic and political opportunities that come with recognized statehood. But it has also been spared some of the problems that independent statehood can present to developing countries. It receives little bilateral aid, forcing the government to spend over 50 percent of its budget on security alone. Yet that absence of foreign help means that the government is not dependent on outsiders’ generosity or strategic interests, as is the case in even the most prosperous countries in sub-Saharan Africa. Somaliland cannot get loans from international financial institutions, but it has also accumulated little official debt. Somaliland’s statelessness precludes any major foreign commercial investment, since it’s nearly impossible to insure projects in an unrecognized territory; but as a consequence, the economy is not captive to a single big industry or employer, which can sometimes distort the economic development of poor countries. The government is weak, but it’s debatable as to whether Dahabshiil would have been allowed to grow into a continent-wide behemoth if it were operating within a more typical political and regulatory context. One Western expert raised the possibility that the international community feels that “dangling recognition keeps Somaliland on its best behavior.”\n\nNearly every state in the Horn of Africa is challenged by potentially ruinous problems: Djibouti is a dictatorship, Ethiopia is an autocracy held together by a fragile ethnic truce, Eritrea is a hermit state under international sanctions, and Somalia remains a constellation of Islamist groups and clan militias. About 1,800 miles north of Hargeisa, the Islamic State (ISIS) is plunging the heart of the Arab Middle East into chaos, and assuming the same permanent, territorial character as al-Shabaab in Somalia. The al-Qaida splinter group’s rapid advance through Iraq and Syria is a reminder of how quickly a country’s dynamics can shift in the face of a jihadist threat that’s more determined and better organized than the state itself. But so far, Somaliland has avoided the worst of the broader region’s demons. It is the most democratic and stable territory in its neighborhood. Hargeisa has about as much dynamism as a poor and isolated desert city could hope for. Goats crowd into what little shade is available, even along the city’s main streets. The capital’s attractions include a camel market and a rusting, Barre-era Soviet MiG, perched atop a monument to the city’s near-destruction during the opening days of Somalia’s civil war. Pigeons crowd along its rusting wings, but after one visits Mogadishu, the MiG can seem like a bitter relic from a time when Somalia was even capable of sustaining an air force. For Somalilanders, the plane is a reminder of what that air force did to them: on the pedestal of the memorial are reliefs of soldiers and children with bleeding and empty arm sockets, standing before a burning city.\n\nBut the MiG sits between the new Somali Telecom building and Dahabshiil’s even newer Hargeisa headquarters—glass-and-steel prisms hulking over crammed, dust-clogged streets. On a tastefully landscaped compound sits the Man-Soor hotel, where aid workers, businessmen, and cabinet ministers spend their evenings over cups of milky Somali tea. In the Man-Soor, the general calm stands in stark contrast to the violence and turmoil often unfolding on the hotel lobby’s TV screens. Somaliland’s greatest achievement may be that, minute to minute, it is remarkably boring.\n\nWhen the topic of reunification with the south comes up, Somalilanders raise an obvious question: Why ruin what they have now? “Organizing Somaliland as an independent state is our top goal,” Ahmed Mohammed Deriye, a member of parliament, told me. “They’re our neighbors, our brothers—but it’s difficult to go back to where things were,” says Ismail about Somalia. “We have tasted and tested unity. And it didn’t work. Someone born 22 years ago doesn’t know about the south.”\n\nThe answer to why things might yet change lies partly in the international community’s long-standing investment in a unified, federated Somalia. The rest of the world doesn’t boycott Somaliland, as it would a rebel movement or terrorist group; Britain’s ambassador to Ethiopia appeared at the book fair, and Somaliland has diplomatic missions in London and Addis Ababa. Instead, it is treated as a better-organized version of Puntland or Jubbaland, semiautonomous regions within Somalia proper, with governments functionally independent of Mogadishu but still pledging fealty to the idea of a united country. The nascent and still barely functioning Mogadishu government cannot project power and legitimacy without the help of these local authorities as well as militia groups—hence the August 2013 agreement between Mogadishu and the Ras Kamboni militia, which helped bring the port of Kismayo under the government’s putative control. Somalia likely cannot survive as a coherent political or national unit without some kind of permanent arrangement between Mogadishu and these semiautonomous regions. Observers fear, not without reason, that chaos will follow if Somaliland is exempted from such a process.\n\nDaveed Gartenstein-Ross, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, warns that an independent Somaliland has the potential to weaken its southern neighbors greatly. “Southern Somalia would lose the chance to get revenue from resources within Somaliland, and you’d be breaking off the part of the country that is most successful and most stable,” he says, emphasizing that he takes no position on the recognition question. “At the end of the day, independence is 100 percent better for the people of Somaliland,” he says. “It would also clearly make it worse for everyone in southern Somalia.”\n\nOutright independence would doubtless inflame an existing border dispute between Puntland and Somaliland and create a permanent set of grievances between Somalia and Somaliland, with each disputing the other’s existence and legitimacy. Even more damagingly, it would preclude creative means of state-building that could raise Somalia out of its current morass. Why an independent Somaliland, for instance, instead of a Somali confederacy, with shared foreign policy and revenue collection but dual capital cities, separate budgets, and separate militaries? It’s not inconceivable that a union could be achieved that maintained both Somalia’s integrity and Somaliland’s relative autonomy.\n\nIt’s hard to see the urgency of any such change, however, when walking around Hargeisa’s pacified streets. Understandably, Somalilanders don’t want to weigh the benefits of a hypothetical agreement with the south against the relative tranquillity of their current situation. For them, it’s the lack of independent recognition that is threatening—a condition that forestalls aid and investment and chokes off potential economic growth at a time when Somaliland is stable and democratic enough to benefit from such outside engagement. As Faisal Ali puts it, “one way to destroy a state is not to recognize it.”\n\nA temporary solution to the Somaliland recognition problem, at least for the United States, might be to pass something akin to the 1979 Taiwan Relations Act, establishing the kind of bilateral relations that the U.S. would maintain with any sovereign state but without implying any official status. Yet this would only sidestep the deeper problem. For all its surprises, Somaliland remains a limb of Hadraawi’s rotting and dismembered she-camel, a healthy appendage attached to a moldering body.

Typically less bulky than a dive watch, more simple than a chronograph and more fitting for daily use than most dress watches, field watches have a lot to offer. While I’ll admit this is a simplification, when someone is asking for help picking a new watch and has no idea of the thousands of options at their disposal, such simplifications are quite handy. More to the point of this review, the Hamilton Khaki Field is a line I frequently recommend to friends who are looking for their first “good” watch. With strong legibility, classic styling and a range of case size and movement options, the Khaki Field has earned its place among the best entry-level Swiss watches. We even gave one away last month.\n\nThis specific Khaki Field may be familiar to those of you who have an eye for spotting watches in movies and television shows. This Khaki Field, the Titanium Auto (ref: H70575733), can be seen in Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, the latest in the Tom Clancy-inspired movie franchise. Worn by analyst-turned-field operative and all around good guy Jack Ryan, the Khaki Field Titanium Auto is a solid choice for this character and certainly looks the part next to the parade of tactical gear that is seen in the film.\n\nheight=\"411\" width=\"730\" allowfullscreen=\"\" frameborder=\"0\">\n\nThe Titanium Auto’s case is 42 mm wide and made, predictably, of lightweight titanium. Measuring 52 mm lug to lug and just 11.75 mm thick at the crest of its slightly-domed sapphire crystal, this Khaki Field iteration may be the most wearable in the line, weighing only 66g with the strap.\n\nTreated to a matte black PVD coating, the Titanium Auto has the look of a piece of military equipment and the finish is remarkable and better than most PVD treatments we commonly see. As a finishing touch, Hamilton has fitted the Titanium Auto with a matching black crown, a welcome addition that is not always seen on cheaper watches.\n\nThe dial design is typical field watch but with a few small flares that serve to remind you of why you spent a bit more on a Hamilton. The text is clean, crisp and super legible with the main arabic hour markers and hands offering a luminous treatment that is accented by luminous pips at every five minute increment on the outer minute scale. The hour markers sit in their own ring within the dial design, which has a slightly shinier finish than the rest of the dial. This adds a bit of visual flare to a dial design that is typically pretty simple.\n\nThe inner dial is host to the branding and model text, which is rendered in a well-proportioned font size and balances nicely with the rest of the dial. Also fitting for a field watch, the Khaki Field Titanium Auto has a 24 hour scale on the inner dial segment. While Hamilton regrettably does not offer a GMT version of this watch, the 24 hour scale aids the military appeal of the Titanium Auto.\n\nThe date display is my only problem with this otherwise excellent watch. It looks like a bit of an afterthought, fitted at three in a manner that cuts into the three marker, likely due to the width of the movement vs the width of the dial. Along with the somewhat awkward placement on the dial, the date display is black text on a white background and on an otherwise entirely black watch, I feel a white on black wheel might have been a more balanced choice.",
  "latent_10587": "Welcome back everyone. I make no apologies for the fact that Peaky Blinders is the garish, glorious show of my heart and this hugely confident opening episode, overflowing with swagger and coming across like the adrenaline-fuelled love child of Downton Abbey and Miller’s Crossing, only reaffirmed my adoration. This is a drama at that imperious stage where it’s hard to go wrong – confident in its storytelling, secure in its character development and trusting the audience to join them on what looks set to be another tumultuous journey through the back streets of Small Heath, Birmingham and the equally dangerous corridors of power.\n\nOur heroes\n\nIt’s almost 18 months since we last saw the Shelby clan. In that time, Peaky Blinders has gone from word-of-mouth hit to A-list-endorsed phenomenon. Fittingly, then, the Shelbys too have moved up in the world. It’s 1924 and Tommy has parlayed his success on the track into an enormous house in Warwickshire – I was particularly taken with the fact that he relegated the family portrait to the stairs and put the painting of himself and Grace’s Secret centre stage – and is now a father and soon-to-be-married man. Of course this is Peaky Blinders, so his wedding to the winsome Grace (whose husband, it transpired, awfully, had killed himself) swiftly descended into horse races, boxing matches, mayhem and murder. By the time Tommy was gazing out of the window of his mansion while Johnny Dogs and the Lees burned the body of a Russian agent, murdered by Arthur, on a pre-ordered pyre, there was little more to say than: welcome back boys! I’m glad the march to respectability hasn’t slowed you down.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A wedding that swiftly descends into boxing matches, mayhem and murder.\n\nTalking of respectability, I remain unsure about Grace. I can make a plausible case for why Tommy married her: she was pregnant with his child and family is everything; her husband killed himself – it’s not clear when exactly – which would have made walking away from her even harder; marrying Grace is less overwhelming than marrying May, who was true aristocracy as opposed to cavalry class and, crucially, ensures Tommy’s autonomy is intact; he does, despite everything, appear to love her. That final point, however, is where I always fall down. Grace has lied and spied and cheated for much of this show’s run, however much she plays the charity-dispensing lady of the house now. As Polly rightly remarked: “It’s only Thomas that’s forgotten what you are.”\n\nCillian Murphy: ‘Is this it, for the rest of my days?’ Read more\n\nAnd what of the rest of the gang? I continue to feel desperately sorry for poor Arthur. When the episode opened I thought the eldest Shelby brother might have turned a corner – the credits say he’s married to the god-fearing Linda and he was clearly trying to stay on the path of righteousness, albeit with mixed results. (“I’m having a couple now and then to remind myself of why I’m off it.”) Unfortunately his brother didn’t build a criminal empire by getting his hands dirty on his own wedding night, so yet again it was down to Arthur to dispatch the Soviet agent in a bloody scene that didn’t shy away from showing us the ugly side of the Shelby organisation. Nor was he the only one feeling the stresses of Shelby life, as Polly was visited by temptation in the form of suave portrait painter Reuben Oliver. The little reveal that she took a gun to the door was cleverly done, demonstrating that all this new wealth hasn’t brought the family security – if anything, the opposite is true.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Arthur, the eldest Shelby brother, is finding it impossible to stay on the path of righteousness.\n\nThe bad guys\n\nWe don’t yet have a clear lead on who this series’ main villain will be now that Sam Neill’s Inspector Campbell is dead. But we did learn the following: Churchill has called in his favour of two years before and it involves White Russians, tanks and is probably building up to the events of August 1924 which saw an uprising against the recently formed Soviet Union in Georgia (where the supposed Grand Duchess Tatiana Petrovna apparently came from). I imagine the series is also going to deal with the Zinoviev letter, which triggered the fall of the first Labour government in 1924, a plot point that will almost certainly pit Ada against her brothers (as well as give her more to do than roll her eyes at Tommy – hurrah). However, this is Tommy Shelby we’re talking about and, as he reminded us at the episode end, he’s a gambling man, which means Churchill’s shenanigans are not the only thing in play here. Instead, our man with the many plans appears to be on the verge of executing an enormous robbery. As to the who, where, what, when and why of that, we don’t yet know but it’s interesting that Grace is clearly as much in the dark as we are.\n\nNotes and observations\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A right royal Shelby wedding.\n\n• The episode was beautifully directed by Belgian director Tim Mielants. At certain points – the boxing fights, the horse race – the whole thing looked like a painting come to life.\n\n• I don’t trust the devious Michael and his bright future. He has backstabber written all over him.\n\n• I do, however, love John and his endless supply of cavalry jokes. Between those, Ada’s socialist small talk and Arthur’s stumbling wedding speech, I’m not sure I’d hire the Shelby clan as public speakers any time soon.\n\n• Polly’s would-be suitor Reuben Oliver is played by the wonderful Alexander Siddig. Here’s hoping he’s given more to do than on Game of Thrones.\n\n• I loved the many horse references – in particular, the fact that Tommy’s Godfather-esque desk for posing seriously behind had a row of little horse sculptures. I like to imagine that the rest of the clan give them to him as presents.\n\n• I’m not a huge fan of Annabelle Wallis’s performance but I do love the scenes between her and Helen McCrory’s Polly, which are always a barbed delight.\n\n• So Tommy is the one who gets out of bed when the baby cries? If it wasn’t for the whole gangland crook, trail of bodies thing, he’d be quite the early-20th century catch.\n\nAnachronistic but strangely right song of the week\n\nNice use of Nick Cave’s Breathless during the wedding vows, but I’m giving this to Radiohead’s You and Whose Army, which played out as Tommy impassively watched the body of the Soviet agent burn.\n\nQuote of the week\n\n“No cocaine, no sport, no telling fortunes, no racing, no fucking sucking petrol out of their fucking cars, and the main thing is – no fighting.” I’m fairly sure every single one of Tommy’s rules was broken by the end of his wedding day – most of them on his orders.\n\nSo what did you think? Are you happy to have the Shelby clan back? What exactly is Tommy planning? And will they all make it through the whole season intact? As ever, all speculation and no spoilers welcome below…",
  "latent_10589": "Not to be confused with Deseret Chemical Depot\n\nDeseret Test Center Logo features globe in aerosol cloud\n\nThe Deseret Test Center was a U.S. Army operated command in charge of testing chemical and biological weapons during the 1960s. Deseret was headquartered at Fort Douglas, Utah, a former U.S. Army base.\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nProgress toward standardizing new biological warfare agents was limited from 1961 to 1962 by the lack of adequate extra-continental test facilities in which toxic agent munitions combinations could be fully assayed without the legal and safety limitations that were necessary in less remote test areas within the Continental United States.[1]\n\nIn May 1962 the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the Deseret Test Center at Fort Douglas, Utah, a disused army base.[2]\n\nThe U.S. Army command at Deseret was established as a result of being tasked with conducting Project 112 and Project SHAD. The Deseret project required a joint task force to undertake overseas chemical and biological testing. In response, the Joint Chiefs of Staff established the Deseret Test Center under the auspices of the U.S. Army Chemical Corps.[3] A directive from May 28, 1962 outlined Deseret Test Center's mission:\n\n...[To] prepare and conduct extra continental tests to assess chemical and biological weapons and defense systems, both by providing support data for research and development and by establishing a basis for the operational and logistic concepts needed for the employment of these systems.[3]\n\nNo tests were actually conducted at Deseret Test Center however, the Deseret administration facility was supported by Dugway Proving Ground about 80 miles (130 km) away.[3][2] The Deseret center occupied Building 103 and 105 at Fort Douglas, where administrative and planning decisions were made. The headquarters at Fort Douglas was staffed by 200 individuals.[2] The U.S. Army closed Deseret Test Center in 1973.[4]\n\nProject Deseret (1961-1963) [ edit ]\n\nProject Deseret was developed to conduct a highly classified military research, development, and testing program which was aimed at both offensive and defensive human, animal, and plant reaction to biological, chemical, toxicological, entomological, and radiological warfare agents in various combinations of climate and terrain.[1][3][2]\n\nThe top secret research was conducted by the United States' Deseret Test Center with Britain, Canada, and Australia under the Quadripartite agreement.[5] During Project Deseret each agent needed to be tested at sea, in the arctic, desert, at sea, and in a tropical jungle environment. In the autumn of 1961 Project Deseret was divided into two main parts consisting of Project 112 and Project SHAD.\n\nProject Deseret was designated to assist not only the Army but the Navy, Marine Corps and the Air Force as well; thus, it was funded jointly by all branches of the U.S. military[3][2] and U.S. intelligence agencies, a euphemism for the Central Intelligence Agency's (CIA) Office of Technical Services.\n\nOn April 17, 1963, President Kennedy signed National Security Action Memorandum 235 (NSAM 235) authorizing:\n\nPolicy guides governing the conduct of large-scale scientific or technological experiments that might have significant or protracted effects on the physical or biological environment. Experiments which by their nature could result in domestic or foreign allegations that they might have such effects will be included in this category even though the sponsoring agency feels confident that such allegations would in fact prove to be unfounded.[6]\n\nThe deployments of Project 112 agents and field testing commenced immediately after the memorandum was signed.\n\nTests [ edit ]\n\nBetween its opening in 1962 and 1973 the Deseret Test Center was at the helm of Project 112,[7][8] a military operation aimed at evaluating chemical and biological weapons in differing environments.[8] The test began in the fall of 1962 and were considered \"ambitious\" by the Chemical Corps; the tests were conducted at sea, in Arctic environments and in tropical environments.[3] Tests were aimed at human, plant and animal reaction to the chemical and biological agents and were conducted in the United States, Liberia, Egypt, South Korea and Okinawa.[3] According to the Department of Defense, Deseret planned 134 chemical and biological weapons tests and of those 46 were carried out and 62 were canceled.[8]\n\nThe tests of Project 112, and the related seaborne Project SHAD, were kept secret until October 2002.[9] Many tests occurred on U.S. soil and released live biological agents, chemical agents or their simulants.[9] In total, according to the reporting of CBS News, more than 5,000 soldiers and sailors were involved in the secret tests, many of them unknowingly.[10] From 1963-1965 there were 18 tests involving biological simulants, usually Bacillus globigii (BG).[7] BG was used to simulate dangerous agents, such as anthrax; once thought harmless to humans, research in the intervening years has revealed some simulants can actually cause infection in those with weakened immune systems.[11] 14 separate tests were performed using VX, sarin, nerve agent simulants and tear gases.[7]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nCoordinates:",
  "latent_10649": "Gov. Steve Bullock speaks before signing the Flathead Water Compact during the 64th Montana Legislative Session in Helena on April 24, 2015. Greg Lindstrom | Flathead Beacon\n\nHELENA — Gov. Steve Bullock revived debate over mail-only voting on Friday when he used his veto power to rewrite a routine bill to allow counties to conduct the May 25 congressional election by mail.\n\nThe governor’s action caught Secretary of State Corey Stapleton off guard. His fellow Republicans in the House, who had killed the bill last month, were scrambling to see if there was a way to prevent the governor’s changes from being debated and getting a floor vote. They might be able to run down the clock — because they can choose to take up the matter any time during the remaining days of the session.\n\nThe 11th-hour political maneuver might be too late for some counties, who are already planning to print ballots, arrange polling sites and assemble thousands of poll workers.\n\nFewer than seven weeks remain before the special election to fill the state’s only congressional seat, which was left vacant when Ryan Zinke resigned to lead the U.S. Interior Department. Republican Greg Gianforte, Democrat Rob Quist and Libertarian Mark Wicks are contesting for the post.\n\n“At this point, many of us clerks can’t keep fighting the battle in Helena. Our focus has to be on the election at hand,” said Regina Plettenberg, the chief elections officer for Ravalli County. “At this point, we are planning on running this election at the polls.”\n\nUsing his veto pen, Bullock rewrote an election bill awaiting his signature. The original bill, sponsored by Democratic Rep. Bryce Bennett of Missoula, mostly addressed mundane election rules such as noticing requirements, clarifying deadlines for local elections.\n\n“I take seriously my responsibility to strengthen our democracy by helping make sure that more eligible citizens can participate in that democracy, not fewer,” the governor said in a press conference announcing his action. “And what is better for democracy than to put a ballot in the hands of every registered voter?”\n\nThe governor’s amendatory veto inserted an entirely new section into Bennett’s 22-page bill, specifying that “the 2017 special election to fill the vacancy in the office of the United States representative for Montana may be conducted by mail.”\n\nThe governor is allowed by state law to issue so-called “amendatory vetoes” to bills he generally supports but will only sign with his suggested changes.\n\nThe issue became a partisan one when the chair of the state’s Republican party, Rep. Jeff Essmann, warned earlier this year that conducting voting by mail could make it easier for Democratic voters to cast ballots and hurt his party’s chance of holding a congressional seat occupied by Republicans for two decades.\n\nHouse Republicans shot back at the governor saying that mail-only balloting is bad policy.\n\n“It’s unfortunate that he’s trying to use his power to shoehorn a completely different piece of legislation into a simple cleanup bill that has already moved through the process,” said Lindsey Singer, the spokeswoman for the leadership of the Republican-controlled House.\n\nThe Senate had already consented to the mail-only ballot, but House Republicans successfully blocked the measure from a floor debate. Most thought the effort had died last week when the House rejected a bid to revive the bill sponsored by Sen. Steve Fitzpatrick, a Republican from Great Falls.\n\nCountry elections officials have been pushing lawmakers to allow the election to be conducted by mail, arguing that it could save them as much as $750,000, as well as save them from the logistical nightmares of running an election on short notice.\n\nCounty clerks face a Monday deadline to present their election plans to the Secretary of State’s Office, but it’s unclear what kind of leeway exists in state election laws that would allow them to pursue a mail-only election beyond the current schedules already outlined. A spokeswoman for the secretary of state did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nWhile some counties have little choice but to move forward with in-person voting, some could quickly shift gears, according to Plettenberg, the Ravalli County clerk.\n\n“If by next week, by some miracle in Helena things get switched to a mail ballot,” she said, “then I can easily switch.”\n\nComments\n\ncomments",
  "latent_10659": "The eastern Chinese city of Nanjing, like many of the country's urban areas, suffers from intense smog.\n\nThe Air Quality Index, which uses a scale from 0 to 500 (with higher numbers indicating worse pollution), rates Nanjing's air quality as 132 – a level considered unhealthy for the public, especially those with respiratory disease.\n\nThe Italian design firm Stefano Boeri Architetti believes that building towers covered in plants could help the city reduce its pollution.\n\nThe company recently announced that it will build two skyscrapers that will hold a total of 1,100 trees and 2,500 cascading shrubs on their rooftops and balconies.\n\nConstruction on the buildings, called the Nanjing Green Towers, began in early 2017 and is set to wrap up next year.\n\nThe design will be similar to that of a two-tower complex that Boeri designed in Milan.

  "latent_10708": "One of the things we like most about motorcycles is that they let us experience the ride directly, rather than from inside a steel and glass cage. That’s why motorcycles and camping are a natural match. After all, why spend the day with the wind in your face only to spend the night in a motel with noisy plumbing? Moto-camping takes a lot of preparation and forethought, and the consequences of not having the right gear or skills are far worse than those of picking the wrong motel.\n\nMotorcycles and camping just go hand in hand, so we are here to help you set up camp. Illustration by Joe Baker\n\nSleeping Bags\n\nLike a motorcycle ride, a motorcycle camping trip is only as good as the equipment you bring along, and one of the most important pieces of camping gear is your sleeping bag. You can put up with a lot on a camping trip—bad roads, bad food, bad weather—as long as you get a good night’s sleep. Most bags are rated by their manufacturers according to how many pounds of insulation are in them, which, in turn, gives you a rough idea of the coldest temperature the bag is suited for. More is not necessarily better when it comes to choosing the right-weight bag. Goose down is a better insulator, pound for pound, than synthetic materials, but it’s more expensive and, when wet, loses its loft, which is the ability to fluff up and hold heat. Synthetics, on the other hand, are cheaper and work just as well for the conditions in which most motorcycle camping will be done. Some are water-resistant, and many are durable enough to withstand repeated washings. Shape is more a matter of personal preference. Mummy bags sleep warmer, because there’s less room inside them, but they constrict foot movement. If you’re a restless sleeper, consider a rectangular bag, which leaves more room for your feet. Sleeping pads add an extra measure of comfort and help insulate you from the cold ground. Many riders still rely on the old standby, a piece of closed-cell foam, but self-inflating pads like the Therm-A-Rest beat foam hands down for comfort and insulation. As light and compact as foam, these come in a variety of widths, lengths and thicknesses, but they tend to be more expensive. Tents\n\nSome moto-campers don’t use tents at all, preferring to drape a tarp over their campsite, anchored to the bike on one side and a picnic table or a tree on the other. A step up from that is the bivy bag, which is essentially a canopy just big enough to cover a sleeping bag. It’s small and light, and it’s quick and easy to set up if all you need is a place to grab a few winks before setting off again the next morning. Most campers prefer the security and privacy of a tent. The range of sizes and styles of camping tents is staggering, but a few general rules apply to all. Make sure the tent you choose is easy to set up. Try it in the store if you’re not sure—it beats trying it in the rain. Self-supporting tents—the most familiar of these are dome-shaped—can be picked up and moved, and even held over your head and shaken to clean out the inside. The best are made of ripstop nylon, which is very hard to tear and easy to patch. When you choose your spot and want to secure your tent, metal stakes are the only ones worth having—and don’t forget to bring something to drive them into the ground with. (The tools on your bike will not prove adequate, and you can’t always find a rock when you need one.) A rain fly does two things: It keeps water off the tent in bad weather, and it protects the tent from damaging UV rays in sunny times. It fits over the tent without touching it, allowing air to circulate and condensation (which naturally forms inside the tent as you sleep) to escape. Water can seep into your tent from below, too, so make sure the floor is waterproof. Even better is a “bathtub” floor, with waterproof material that extends several inches up the sides of the tent. And don’t forget to choose a tent big enough for you to sleep in and store all your gear in at the same time. As a rule of thumb, add one “person” to the tent’s advertised size. A two-person tent is usually just about right for a solo camper’s sleeping bag and riding gear. Ground Cloth\n\nEven if the tent has a waterproof bathtub floor, get a ground cloth to put under it. A simple waterproof plastic or PVC-coated nylon tarp will do. Not only will it add an extra layer of insulation from both cold and moisture, but it will protect your tent’s floor from rocks and rough ground, thus adding years to its useful life. Cooking Gear\n\nIf you plan to cook at your campsite, a cookstove is a must. Smaller is better, but the design you choose will depend to some extent on the kind of food you want to cook. To prepare freeze-dried food in plastic bags, all your stove has to do is heat water to boiling. More elaborate, multistage meals will require a more elaborate stove, or in some cases, two separate ones. Depending on the design of the stove, it can run on alcohol, propane, butane, white gas, kerosene or the unleaded gasoline in your bike’s tank. These fuels are available in lightweight, compact canisters. They can also be purchased in bulk and transported in readily available aluminum flasks. An important factor to keep in mind is that food, fuel, water and all other necessary items can be replenished without difficulty, so unless you’re heading for the farthest remotes of the Zimbabwe outback, it’s not necessary to transport more than a liter of water or fuel and several days’ worth of food at a time. You’ll need cookware, too, including cutlery and pots and pans. Get purpose-built backpacking cookware that “nests”—the pieces fit inside each other and take up no more room than the largest piece—for compact storage. Ditto for cutlery, and make sure it’s durable. Plastic cutlery isn’t much good for handling very hot food right out of the pot. And don’t forget biodegradable dishwashing soap for the cleanup. Other Stuff\n\nIn addition to whatever you’d pack if you were moteling it, add a knife or a hatchet with a saw blade, a first-aid kit, a flashlight and fresh batteries, snacks for quick meals, insect repellent, a container for water, waterproof matches, rope, shoelaces, trash bags and toilet paper. The more experienced a camper you become, the more items you’ll add to the list.\n\nYou have limited space on your motorcycle, so be sure to pack properly. Illustration by Joe Baker\n\nPacking\n\nNow that you know what to bring, you have to fit it all on the bike. Heavy items should be positioned as low as possible and in front of the rear axle. Lighter things can go up higher and farther to the rear. The idea is to keep the loaded bike’s center of gravity in about the same place as it would be if the bike were unloaded. You can save some space by using compression bags to compress your sleeping bag and tent, but remember that while this makes them smaller, it doesn’t make them lighter. Whatever you do, though, don’t strap your tent or sleeping bag onto the handlebar or front fork like you’ve seen Bronson do in late-night reruns. The weight will affect your bike’s handling, and that’s the last place you want heavy items in an emergency where you might have to steer yourself out of trouble. On the fork it also blocks cooling air from reaching your engine. Pack so the items you’ll need first when you check into your campsite are the easiest to get to. Your tent and ground cloth are the first things you’ll set up, so they should be the last things you pack. Savvy moto-campers also designate “wet” and “dry” saddlebags or duffels. The wet bag is for your soggy, just-unpitched tent and ground cloth, for example, while the dry bag is for your clean clothes and sleeping bag.\n\nWant more news like this?

Even if your bike has saddlebags, they won’t be big enough to carry everything. Unless you’re traveling two-up, however, you should be able to get most of your gear on the bike without making it look like a Conestoga wagon heading west. Put heavy items in a pair of throw-over saddlebags, and store heavy or bulky items in a duffel bag or seat bag on the passenger seat. If your bike has a sissy bar, consider something like the T-Bag, but don’t put heavy items in it unless you absolutely have to, and even then place them only in the bottom of the bag. Put small items that you want to get at quickly—sunscreen, sunglasses, maps, eyeglass repair kit—in a tank bag. Trial Run\n\nBefore you set off on your big trip, pack all your gear on the bike and ride it around for an hour or so. Make sure the load stays stable and doesn’t affect the bike’s handling. Next, spend the night in a nearby campground or in your backyard. That way if you forgot something important, or if some piece of equipment doesn’t work, you can pack up and go home. The trial run has the added advantage of letting you develop and practice your camping routine, so that when you arrive at the real campsite, everything will go a lot more smoothly. Choosing a Campsite\n\nOnce you arrive, it’s time to set up camp. Choose your campsite carefully, and avoid pitching camp in low areas where rain might collect or cold air and fog might settle at night. Make sure the prevailing winds don’t blow smoke from other campsites toward yours. Avoid sloping or rough, rocky ground. Open up your sleeping bag and lie down if you’re unsure if it’s level—in five minutes you’ll know. Look for hives that might house bees, grass (biting insects) and standing water (mosquitoes). Watch where the sun tracks and set up your tent for maximum shade or sunlight. Leave No Trace\n\nFew activities you do on a motorcycle are likely to bring you into such close contact with non-motorcyclists as camping. Even though you might be surrounded by enormous RVs, their generators chugging away and scaring off all wildlife within a five-mile radius, it’s you and your motorcycle everyone will be peeking out at from behind their curtained windows. Defy their expectations by setting up camp quietly, especially if you arrive at night. Don’t rev your engine to herald your arrival, and if your bike has loud pipes, consider asking for a space close to the campground entrance and pushing your bike to it. Be friendly with the other campers. Don’t wait for them to start conversations—go over and introduce yourself. Besides being a great way to show non-motorcyclists that there’s a genuine human being under your leathers, getting to know other people from other places is part of the fun of camping. When it’s finally time to break camp, clean your campsite thoroughly. Put yourself in the place of the people who will use your site next, and ask yourself how you’d like it to look when you set up camp. Drown the fire, pick up all your trash and leave as quietly as you arrived. Ideally, after you’re gone, no one will be able to tell you were ever there.\n\nNothing is better than having a nice warm meal cooked over the campfire, but what if there isn't enough room for a cooler on your motorcycle?

  "latent_10789": "The University of Miami’s new president, Julio Frenk, has taken a backseat in the hiring of a football coach. This is a complete U-turn from previous president Donna Shalala, who was in the middle of vetting candidates and overseeing decisions.\n\nFrenk wants the finalists – or perhaps the finalist – brought to him. So the question becomes who will be deciding on who that finalist is. The answer is it’s essentially a three-man committee involving athletic director Blake James and two Board of Trustee members with deep roots and deeper bank accounts, Paul DiMare and Stuart Miller.\n\nDon’t discount the Board members’ political weight (and financial backing) here. Miller and his family’s homebuilding company, the Lennar Corporation, gave more than $221 million toward the school’s medical school, according to the university and reports.\n\nDiMare’s latest donation to the school was $12.5 million, of which $6 million was to fund scholarships to the Leonard Miller Medical School. Leonard Miller founded Lennar. Stuart Miller is Leonard’s son.\n\nSee how this is all interconnected?\n\nDiMare also has given $3 million in recent years to the athletic department. That’s why the Paul J. DiMare Gallery of Champions in the athletic building that showcases national championship trophies. His son, Gino, a long-time Hurricane baseball assistant, will take over as coach when Jim Morris retires in 2018.\n\nIt’s clear these names know business. Do they know what make this football program tick? Many schools get a search firm. We'll see if Miami does as this moves forward.\n\nOne of the first names that was reached out to was Mike Shula, according to a source. (The Miami Herald's Barry Jackson reported this first.) Shula is a respected name and becoming a hot commodity as Carolina’s offensive coordinator. The loud whispers on him started last week. But he isn’t interested, it seems.\n\nThe larger question is whether he would have been right for the job. Does he have any connections with Miami high schools, which is the prime selling point for the job? Could he develop them quickly?\n\nIt says something more about the process that Shula was contacted last week and that whispers came from all over when he was. We’ll have to see where this goes. These are strong, influential and rich businessmen involved. They obviously love the university. They also were involved in the hiring of Al Golden during the previous coaching search (with then-AD Kirby Hocutt).\n\nThe question becomes: Do they get the right coach for the job this time?\n\n2. Ndamukong Suh had to apologize to his mother for his on-air curse getting caught on microphone last Sunday? How about the NFL apologizing to him. In successive plays: 1) he should have got a sack when he had Tyrod Taylor in his grasp and didn't throw him to the ground for fear of roughing penalty; 2) he was obviously held by right guard John Miller, allowing Taylor to complete a 44-yard touchdown to Miami.\n\n3. Before the season, Jeff Van Gundy said he wanted to see how Dwyane Wade and Goran Dragic play together considering their opposite games. Wade wants to slow the tempo, get the ball and find the mid-range shot. Dragic prefers to run, and, in the half-court offense, run a pick-and-roll that needs a spot-up outside shooter as an option to keep defenses from collapsing on him (which they've done). This remains a question through the first stretch of the season. The Heat is finding how it wants to play. But Dragic and Wade often aren't part of that.\n\n4. Don Shula is rooting for another team to have a Perfect Season - Carolina, where son Mike is the offensive coordinator, as I wrote in my column today.\n\n5.

He likes to play but he actually hits the ball very nicely.\"\n\nTrump has a history of praising the Clintons, and even defended Bill Clinton publicly in the aftermath of the Monica Lewinsky scandal.\n\nClinton still has a locker at Trump's golf course in Westchester County near the Clinton's upstate home.",
  "latent_10899": "You can’t make this stuff up. A photo of an Arlington, Texas man popped up on social media this week and left little to the imagination. The man, baring only a gold speedo style swimsuit, dosed himself in peanut butter and walked into the gated enclosure of a Deep Ellum dog park in the name of fantasy football.\n\nSteven Shrout had never played in a fantasy football league until this past year. He decided to join a 12-team league with his high school friends who have been playing since 2009. If you’ve never played, Fantasy Football is a mostly online game where you are the virtual owner of a professional football team. You draft the players you want, and how they do in the real game translates to how many points you receive. Some leagues even allow you to win cold, hard, cash for your picks. And some leagues, like the one Steven was in, ruled that the worst record holder either had to pay the winner additional cash or perform a humiliating stunt. Steven chose the latter.\n\nThe league decided that Steven would have to stand in the middle of a Dallas dog park for ten minutes while wearing a gold speedo and covered in creamy JIF peanut butter.\n\nThe Texas man said, “It wasn’t a big challenge” and covered himself in three jars of JIF as his friend’s watched and took some videos. “My strategy was to do it as fast as possible, and hope that not many people would see me,” Steven shared with WFAA. However, it’s hard to miss a nearly naked man walking around the dog park drenched in every dog’s favorite treat. “There was a couple who walked by me down the sidewalk, they both said ‘EWW’ and walked by so fast after that.”\n\nThe dog owners found themselves speechless, however, that’s nothing compared to the social media viral storm Steven set off. “I think my favorite comment was, ‘Lost bet equals “This is my kinky fetish,”‘ and I said, ‘Absolutely not.’ That made me laugh really hard.”\n\nA lot of people are asking if he’ll play fantasy football again. “I will, but probably not with the same guys,” Steven shares with a laugh.",
  "latent_11215": "A A\n\nMILTON, Wash. - A family in Milton held a suspected intoxicated intruder at gunpoint after they say he took off his pants and crawled into bed with their 12-year-old daughter.\n\nThe terrifying ordeal began when the intruder pushed through a locked front door and entered the home as the family was sound asleep.\n\n\"This is where we found his coat; his shoes were sitting right here on the floor,\" says Emily Kiely as she recounts the events of that night.\n\nBut she says the intruder didn't stop there. He then went into her 12-year-old daughter's room, taking off his pants and crawling into bed with her.\n\nKiely says her daughter was petrified when she realized what was happening.\n\n\"She didn't know if we were dead, and was wondering, 'Why is this guy in my room? Why is he in my house? And where are my parents?'\" says Kiely.\n\nThe girl held still until the intruder fell asleep, then bolted for her parents' room.\n\nEmily Kiely says, \"My husband flew up, grabbed his gun.\"\n\nShe says the intruder woke up and kept trying to reach for his pants.\n\n\"My husband said, 'If you move I'm going to shoot you. If you move I'm going to shoot you,\" she recounts.\n\nHer husband held the man until police arrived. Keily thinks the intruder may have been under the influence.\n\n\"He didn't make any sense; nothing he said made any sense,\" she says.\n\nBut she thinks even a confused drunk person wouldn't make that kind of mistake.\n\n\"They don't go into a 12-year-old's bedroom, take their pants off and get into bed with her,\" says Kiely.\n\n\"Thank God my husband didn't shoot him - otherwise that would have been a whole other story,\" says Kiely. \"But I'm glad we did have something to defend ourselves and glad my daughter is safe.\"\n\nNevertheless, it will be a while before anyone in the family sleeps easy again.",
  "latent_11405": "Ladies and gentlemen, we are facing an epidemic. Yes, bandwagonitis, an obscure but deadly disease that only appears in October, is sweeping the nation. You or someone you know may already have been infected. Symptoms include:\n\nwearing a Red Sox hat and a Rockies jersey because you “really like them both”\n\npurchasing baseball paraphernalia after October 1st, 2007\n\nrooting for the Colorado Rockies\n\nAs bandwagonitis is a seasonal affliction, its virulence in any given year is subject to environmental factors. The current strain is something of a “perfect storm” of treatment-resistant forms of the disease. In 2004 we first saw the rise of the “Reverse the Curse” strain of bandwagonitis which ripped through the country like wildfire, leaving a trail of pink Red Sox cap-wearing Midwestern girls and tearful parents in its wake. This year, that strain, though somewhat weakened since 2004, is meeting up with another form of the disease that seems to recur every four or five years: the Cinderella Story.\n\nIt should be emphasized that this is not a Cinderella Story strain to take lightly. Medical professionals will think back to the 1997 Florida Marlin Cinderella Story bandwagonitis and scoff. Yes, it is true that everyone expected a virulent form of the disease that year, and that fear proved to be unfounded, but remember the critical oversight: the citizens of Florida were too busy golfing and waiting to die to know that a World Series was being played, having only just recently left there New Jersey swingset installations for warmer pastures. We should not expect a similar reprieve from Colorado this year, as the early winter has driven innocent Coloradans into their living rooms and bars until ski season begins, putting them in grave danger of becoming victims.\n\nThe only real cure for bandwagonitis (a steady diet of baseball games on television, radio, or in person, at least 50 in a calendar year) is rarely undertaken and is seen by many victims as worse than the disease itself. Left untreated, the disease will fade into remission over time. As such, the CDC* has released the following set of guidelines for those afflicted with bandwagonitis to follow in order to reduce its harmful effects on Real Fans, who are always the hardest hit during these times:\n\nDo not try to call balls and strikes. You do not know what a strike is.\n\nIf you are watching a game with a Real Fan, be courteous. Offer to get them a beer whenever you get up, or to kneel on all fours and act as their footrest.\n\nDo not under any circumstances taunt a Real Fan of the six teams no longer in the playoffs** unless you know more about your “own” team than they do. Except Diamondbacks fans, of course, as no Real Fan has ever been confirmed among them.\n\nIf we all work together, I’m confident we can make it safely through October.\n\nSigned,\n\nDr. Bitter Yankees Fan, M.D.\n\n* The Center for Douchebag Control.\n\n** And Padres.\n\nThe Rules is a (mostly) weekly column by Ethan Todras-Whitehill setting forth the definitive truth on just about everything. It appears on Mondays.",

He is being held at the Macomb County Jail. He faces possible jail time of 10 years for discharging a weapon and an additional two years for the felony firearm charges.\n\nGullion of Ray Township was arrested early Thursday morning for allegedly firing five shots from a .40 caliber handgun after his wife was involved in a dispute with the homeowners, Macomb County Sheriff Anthony Wickersham said during a press conference. No one was injured.\n\nWickersham added it is not known if the handgun was department issued.\n\n\"It is extremely bizarre,\" Wickersham said of the crime. \"It sounded like someone's feelings got hurt. He took it upon himself that he was going to send a message to those individuals ... that being firing into the house.\n\nAccording to Wickersham, Gullion's wife provides in-home medical care to the 62-year-old female who lives with her 61-year-old husband in a house in the 16000 block of 29 Mile near Romeo Plank.\n\nThe sheriff said a third party told Gullion's wife the husband made disparaging remarks about her. When Gullion was told of the comments, he began texting and calling the older couple Wednesday evening.\n\nWickersham said they received a call about the shooting at 2:12 a.m. Thursday. After investigating, deputies went to the officer's home, where he agreed to go to the sheriff's office for an interview.\n\nThe officer indicated to deputies he was on a leave of absence from the Detroit Police Department.\n\nGullion was arrested after the interview.\n\nDetroit Police Chief James Craig said Gullion has been with the department since 2009 but has been on medical leave for several months. The officer most recently worked in the 9th precinct on the city's east side.\n\nThe Macomb County Sheriff's Office is handling a criminal investigation into the incident, Craig said. The Detroit Police Department will complete its own internal investigation.\n\nThe officer, Craig said, will be placed on unpaid suspension.\n\nWickersham said: \"I truly believe that in law enforcement we all should be held to a higher standard and we have to be able to control our emotions.\"\n\nGullion is scheduled to appear in 42-2 District Court on April 28.\n\nhfournier@detroitnews.com\n\n(313) 223-4616\n\n@HollyPFournier\n\nStaff Writer George Hunter contributed.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://detne.ws/1yym89t",

Many parents don't know the devices can also access the internet.\n\nOne Carlsbad couple is frantically searching for their missing daughter after police say she met a middle-aged man online using her gaming console.\n\nKaitlin and Danny Smith are so protective of their teenage daughter Christine. They don't even let her have a cell phone. Still, they thought it was safe to buy her a device to play video games.\n\n\"We got her a Nintendo DS for Christmas and we didn't realize that it had internet access on it, and that's how she was bale to get online without us knowing,\" Kaitlin Smith said.\n\nIt's true, many gaming and music devices like the Nintendo DS and the Apple iTouch now come with internet browsers to go online via a wifi connection. There's no cell phone service required.\n\n\"She's always been warned that people online are not what they appear to be. She's only 17 years old,\"\n\nPolice say Christine Jelinek may have used the wifi connection inside a Subway sandwich shop in San Marcos last week to chat with a stranger. A white male in his late 40s who showed up at the mall and sat down at a table with the girl inside Miriah's Westwind Restaurant.\n\n\"He sat here for 45 minutes or so, talking to the young lady,\" owner Michael Syodin said.\n\nAn employee of a nearby business saw Christine with the man and called her parents. By that time, the man had left, and Christine told her parents she had not met the man.\n\n\"The father and mother brought her in here and asked if she had been here, because she had told her parents she hadn't, and I did identify her, and said that it was her and she had been here.,\" Syodin said.\n\nNeighbors in the Carlsbad apartment complex where the family lives say Christine was put on restriction. But last Wednesday, she snuck out in the middle of the night and hasn't been seen since.\n\nNews 8 also discovered an open wifi connection at the complex where Christine lives, so she could have been chatting online with the man from her own home.\n\nTo prevent your child from going online using a Nintendo DS, you need to go into the settings menu and set up parental controls.

All I can do is go back to the people who care.”\n\nWhite, who spent seven years as president of the St. Paul Black Ministerial Alliance, said his 22-year-old church’s financial hurdles started in 2005 after he flew to Atlanta and cast a vote in support of same-sex marriage during the United Church of Christ’s national synod.\n\nA resolution in favor of gay marriage passed the synod, but after he explained his decision to his skeptical flock that Sunday, he saw attendance in the pews drop off immediately the next week.\n\nThe trickle of departures became a flood, and soon nearly three-fourths of the congregation had walked out the door and refused to return.\n\nThese days, his spirited sermons may draw 18 to 50 members, but White still has not stopped advocating for gay equality.\n\n“Things were going fine, and (then) he gave his opinion,” said Gregory Thomas, 54, of St. Paul, who has been attending Grace Community for seven months. His adult daughter has been a member for years.\n\nThey attributed the drop-off in membership squarely to White’s support of gay rights, and nothing else.\n\n“Me, personally, I just think that sometimes people are not open-minded. I’ll just leave it at that,” Thomas said.\n\nThe drop-off caused a steep financial toll, so White discussed the issue with his remaining church members, one of whom offered an aunt in Seattle as a broker.\n\nThrough her and a second broker, the church took out a $150,000 loan in April 2007 with Direct Lending, and has regretted it ever since.\n\nDirect Lending later sold the note, which initially carried a 13.5 percent interest rate, to Seattle-area property manager Fenn Shrader, according to court records.\n\nWhite maintains the interest rate has since ballooned to 23 percent.\n\nWhite said between brokers’ fees, appraisal fees and regular payments, Grace Community has put $90,000 toward the loan in the past six years, but the principal hasn’t gone down a penny. Instead, penalties for missed payments and interest fees increased the debt to $247,000, according to foreclosure documents filed in Ramsey County District Court.\n\nAbout two years into the loan, the church fell behind on payments. “We just didn’t have it,” White said. “We had a garage sale, and we raised about $5. We had fish fries … and we might raise $200.”\n\nLegal efforts to get Shrader to lower the debt or interest rate resulted in a stiff agreement a few months ago. On Wednesday, May 2, Shrader said he had another buyer lined up for the property, and the only way Grace Community could keep its church would be to buy out the loan by June.\n\n“They need to come up with $175,000 this month to buy back the loan, or ask for an extension,” said Shrader.\n\nJeff O’Brien, an attorney for Shrader, said the amount was “negotiated between the parties, and they had an attorney as well. The bottom line is there’s a settlement in place, and its substantially less than the outstanding balance.”\n\nThrough fundraising letters, White appealed to 40 congregations for help. In February, a predominantly gay congregation in Dallas, the Cathedral of Hope United Church of Christ, surprised White with a gift of $15,000.\n\nHe hoped it would be enough to keep Grace Community afloat while he secured a refinancing deal.\n\nHe’s grateful for the donation and the ensuing media coverage, but the contribution also has proved to be a mixed blessing.\n\n“We’ve had wonderful support that came from all over the country, literally. Actually, we’ve got some support from as far away as Australia and Canada. … The support was $25 here, $50 there,” White said.\n\nBankers have also noticed his story and pointed to Grace Community’s decline in membership as a reason to shut the door on his refinancing application.\n\nSaid White: “They’re all basically singing the same song: ‘You’ve got to have three to five years of financial stability.’ ”\n\nThere have been other repercussions. Not long after receiving the funds from the Dallas congregation — which bills itself as “the world’s largest gay church” — Grace Community lost one of its two tenants, a group of Seventh Day Adventists known as Righteousness by Faith Ministries.\n\n“They were there every Saturday,” White said. “(Their church leader) was there on the same day that the people from Dallas came in and gave us that check. He wants to be my friend, but he’s staunchly holding onto … that I am dead wrong with my advocacy, and I am headed for hell, and he’s going to heaven.”\n\nElder Donald Keith of Righteousness by Faith Ministries said homosexuality “is just not a lifestyle we felt the church could embrace.”\n\n“I like the man,” said Keith. “I like the congregation very much. I wrote to him, and I told him, we just did not feel we could support a movement that’s in opposition to the Scriptures. It isn’t that we don’t love people that have that persuasion or problem. God loves us all.”\n\nWhite spent two years as an aide and liaison to the black community under then-St. Paul Mayor Jim Scheibel in the early 1990s, but White’s ties to many of his peers in black religious circles have become equally strained.\n\nFor his stance, White sometimes receives threatening phone calls and abusive emails.\n\n“I’m afraid to go to my church at night sometimes,” he said.\n\nAbout a month ago, as he was leading a wedding ceremony, a car drove by and someone inside fired four shots out the window while yelling, “Die, faggots.”\n\nNo one was hurt, though about 10 wedding participants were standing outside.\n\nThomas, the parishioner, whose son was getting married to a woman from northwestern Wisconsin, said he found it embarrassing that her family’s first taste of the East Side ended in gunfire.\n\nRecently, White went to a cemetery to meditate.\n\nThere was no way he would renounce his support for gay marriage rights, he decided. Instead, he’s counting on the $1 donation campaign to save Grace Community.\n\nFrederick Melo can be reached at 651-228-2172. Follow him at twitter.com/FrederickMelo.",
  "latent_12025": "The Labour leader of Glasgow City Council told his fellow judges which design should win the competition to revamp the city's George Square at the outset of the judging process, two independent council sources have told the Sunday Herald.\n\nAnd when the judges instead picked a design that Gordon Matheson strongly disliked, he scrapped the project in what the sources described as \"a fit of pique\".\n\nAlthough the chairman of the judging panel was officially David Mackay, a partner in MBM Architects Barcelona, the Sunday Herald has been told by two sources that Matheson made it clear at the first meeting that he would be de facto chairman as he was council leader and the redesign was his brainchild, adding that public opposition would not affect the outcome.\n\nThe sources say Matheson then appeared to pre-empt the judging process by saying he thought Option 6, by architects Burns & Nice, should win. He also openly criticised Option 2, by John McAslan & Partners, sources said.\n\nHowever, when the results came in, on Thursday, January 17, they showed the McAslan design was the winner. Matheson's preferred option came fourth.\n\nMatheson \"had his head in his hands\", according to one council source.\n\nThere was then a break over the weekend, and when the judges reconvened last Monday, the McAslan design was formally signed off as the winner, resulting in jubilation at the practice.\n\nBut within moments, as the judges and council officials relaxed at the end of the process, Matheson informed them that his administration would not proceed with the redesign after all, and there would be a vague \"facelift\" to remove the old red tarmac instead.\n\n\"It was disappointing, frustrating and a lost opportunity,\" said one of those intimately involved in the design contest.\n\nAnother senior source called it \"a bombshell\".\n\nMatheson then issued a press release saying public opposition had driven the U-turn.\n\nHe stated: \"The people of Glasgow have made it clear that they do not want a radical redesign - I am proud that I am listening to them.\"\n\nBut well-placed council sources claim Matheson had, in fact, \"thrown his toys out the pram\" and \"pulled the plug in a fit of pique because he lost\".\n\nOne senior council source said: \"Cllr Matheson had an idea, included it in his manifesto, and then decided that it was his way or not at all. It's a flagrant waste of public money and of everyone else who was involved in the process. People should have been advising against this disregard of due process.\"\n\nAnother senior source said: \"It's been a farce.\"\n\nA Labour councillor described the design contest as \"a f***ing disaster\" for Glasgow, adding: \"It was all vanity stuff. Matheson probably wanted his name in George Square somewhere. It's like Carry On Council sometimes. You couldn't make it up.\"\n\nThe aborted exercise is expected to cost taxpayers up to £100,000, with all the firms who applied to revamp the square racking up about £250,000 costs.\n\nOpposition parties last night called for the spending watchdog Audit Scotland to investigate.\n\nMatheson's judgment is already in the spotlight after it emerged that police had reported him to prosecutors over an alleged public sex act with another man in a car near his home. No action was taken after prosecutors concluded there was \"insufficient evidence\" of a crime.\n\nMatheson said the alleged incident, in Glasgow's southside last month, had exposed \"an affair\" and apologised to his civil partner, Stephen Wallace.\n\nThere has been speculation that Matheson pulled the George Square project because he felt too weak politically after the news broke to cope with any level of public hostility to the plan.\n\nMatheson kick-started the George Square revamp process in April last year when he included a pledge in Labour's manifesto to upgrade the square as part of preparations for the 2014 Commonwealth Games.\n\nHowever, a £14,000 focus group exercise by pollsters Mori for the council in August found public appetite for a radical change was \"at best lukewarm\".\n\nAlthough people wanted the red tarmac removed, they were worried about costs, loss of statues, and the potential loss of grass and flowerbeds.\n\nDespite this, the council pressed ahead with an international competition in September, with the design brief discussing radical changes such as the removal of all the statues bar the Cenotaph, removal of flower beds, and a new water feature.\n\nAfter 35 entries came in from around the world, six were shortlisted in November, and Matheson praised their \"international experience\".\n\nOn January 9, when the six shortlisted designs went on display, Matheson insisted the public were behind the changes, despite a growing campaign to save the statues and abandon the overhaul.\n\nThe judging panel was: Matheson; David Mackay, a partner in MBM Architects Barcelona; Professor Andy McMillan, former head of the Mackintosh School of Architecture in Glasgow; David Harding, former head of environmental art at Glasgow School of Art; and Geoff Ellis, director of promoters DF Concerts.\n\nGraeme Hendry, leader of the SNP opposition in Glasgow, said: \"Cllr Matheson was obsessed with turning George Square into his own personal legacy and showed no regard for the public or taxpayers' money. It would now seem that once it became clear the panel didn't support him, he threw the whole project out in an act of petulance. Cllr Matheson's waste of over £100,000 is a matter I would expect to require further investigation.\"\n\nConservative councillor David Meikle said Matheson's \"childish behaviour\" had cost taxpayers dear.\n\n\"It's now proper that this is investigated and Audit Scotland may be the most appropriate body to look at it. We know it's a red square, but the council leader doesn't need to act like a tsar.\"\n\nA Glasgow City Council spokesman said: \"It became clear over the course of the process that there was no public support for a substantial redesign and whatever design had been picked would not be being implemented.\"",
  "latent_12178": "Editor’s Note: Pakistani education activist Malala Yousafzai has garnered support all over the world and earned a Nobel Peace Prize last year for her work advocating for girls’ education. Below, teacher Alison Walter explains how a student’s unexpected opinion of Malala gave her a new approach to global lessons.\n\n“Oh, Malala Yousafzai? Tsk. I hate that girl.”\n\nI stared at my student, my head filling with the panicky buzz that teachers get when a child says something socially unacceptable — What do I say now? Where is this attitude coming from? Thank goodness it’s after-school tutoring and the other kids aren’t in here …\n\nPart of my disbelief came from the fact that, until that point, I would have compared this girl to Malala — they were both Pakistani, both very conscientious students, both concerned with what was happening in the world around them and both living in different countries in order to get the education that they and their families wanted. So, since no good response came to mind, I asked, “Why do you hate Malala?”\n\nMy student launched into a very long, very well-thought-out critique of how foreign governments treated Malala as a martyr, giving her benefits like a house and money while women from her village were suffering attacks by the Taliban as retribution. [Editors’ note: According to Louis Belanger of the Malala Fund, the organization advocates for girls’ education in Pakistan and called on the U.S. and British governments to increase funding in the country. The Malala Fund is currently supporting several projects in Pakistan amounting to more than $1.3 million over the next three years. For more information on the Malala Fund, visit their website.]\n\n“How is she helping Pakistan? I want to go back and help my country; that’s why I am getting an education here. She is not helping them. Why does she not ask Britain and the U.S. to give money to the Pakistan government for education?” This outburst turned into a productive conversation about the troubled relationship that the United States has with Pakistan — and with that conversation, a realization that I had been doing something wrong.\n\nI teach Civics — the structure, purpose, and history of American government. In several of my class sections, more than half of my students were born outside of the United States, and a quarter of them speak little to no English. I had been so focused on trying to give them the background to understand American culture, politics and government that I had neglected to leave room for their own backgrounds and experiences.\n\nI teach American government in a global classroom. My students come from five of the seven continents, and a casual count brings me to around 20 different countries of birth. My students spend half of their day on their phones, on Instagram and Twitter. My students know exactly what is happening in the world, as long as it is relevant to their friends, their parents or their news feeds. Although I am required to discuss American politics, if I do not address what drove my students from their homes and what their families are still facing, I leave half of my class in the dust.\n\nWe are teaching and raising a generation that has the world in their pocket. Since my conversation about Malala, I have made two changes to open my classroom up to the world.\n\nFirst, I have stopped fighting the weird obsessions that my 8th graders bring into class with them — one day it’s the Illuminati, another day it’s an utter conviction that they will die from Ebola. Even though the standards and curriculum guidelines don’t seem to connect to global politics, I find a way to make it work. Which branch of government is in charge of health workers abroad during a global pandemic? Are conspiracy theories another tool that the media use to influence elections?\n\nSecond, I am much more careful with choice in my classroom. Frequently, I will give students a selection of three to five different reading options: newspaper articles, textbook excerpts, whatever medium I can use to get content across. Now, instead of focusing on generic high-interest topics like football or Justin Bieber, I think about what my students have brought up that week. Maybe my West African student wants to read about hyperinflation in Zimbabwe, since he was asking me why people can’t afford food in some countries. Then again, he might still choose the article about sports but if I never give him the option, I’ll never know.\n\nIn the crush of testing, standards and the pitfalls facing students in poverty, it is easy to lose sight of the incredible richness that our interconnected world can offer. So far, I have been able to find a few opportunities to pull the world into my classroom.\n\nWhat other ideas can you provide to me and to your colleagues? I’m always looking for more.\n\nAlison Walter is a middle school civics teacher in northern Virginia.",

It is a sweltering hot October afternoon. Outside, a distant Hollywood sign winks in the sun.\n\nLos Angeles is a paradise for pop queens — and those who make their beats.

Teez Tabor from Florida. A bunch of first round cornerbacks.\n\nWhat is happening?\n\nWe go through this every year, and it’s the problem with covering the whole NFL while pushing out some easy content. (I’m required to state all Falcoholic content is painstakingly researched, peer-reviewed, edited, vetted, and voted on by a majority of Congress.) Sometimes it’s easier to look at the Falcons in the Super Bowl and say, “they could probably use a corner.”\n\nThese mock drafts ignore a lot, and by a lot I really mean the roster. And no, this isn’t just, “they forget about Desmond Trufant.” But seriously, a lot of these guys forgot about Trufant. Atlanta has exercised their fifth-year option on Trufant, a player typically ranked somewhere near and among the best corners in the NFL. The Falcons, flush with cap space, said their biggest offseason priority is to extend Trufant’s contract.\n\nWe thought this could be Robert Alford’s last season in Atlanta. He started out as one of the league’s most penalized and burned corners. We also wondered if he was too small for Quinn’s scheme. Alford signed a long-term deal and took a major step forward after Trufant’s injury.\n\nSo the Falcons are using their first round pick on a guy who will only play on obvious passing downs behind those two starters? This rookie would have to outplay Jalen Collins, Dan Quinn’s hand-picked second round corner that looked like a playmaker late last season. He’s a lock for major playing time and should continue to develop.\n\nThen Atlanta is dropping a first on the fourth corner? They’d have to beat out impressive undrafted free agent Brian Poole and converted wide receiver C.J. Goodwin. Even Deji Olatoye and Akeem King looked like they had potential.\n\nWhy are people mocking a corner to the Falcons? The oldest corner on the roster is only 28. THIS IS ALL NONSENSE. I don’t even care about mock drafts but their laziness is making me frustrated. And some analysts go so far as to say their mocks aren’t what they would do, but “what the team is thinking.” 32 general managers gave some analyst their first round targets so they could post it for mock drafts to be seen by millions of people?

  "latent_12656": "Photo\n\nIs Google geekier than Microsoft?\n\nMy last Disruptions column explored Microsoft’s current predicament as it tries to transition from a company that prizes niche technical features in its products to one more like Apple, in which design and simplicity are paramount.\n\nMicrosoft’s current obsession with speeds and feeds led it to make the Microsoft Surface tablets, which came with too many options and were a head-scratcher to many consumers.\n\nBut some readers asked, isn’t Google just like Microsoft — or worse? Google is, after all, the company that has a secret laboratory, Google X, which builds things seemingly far removed from its core business — everything from cars that drive themselves to balloons that deliver the Internet to remote areas of the world. Not to mention the many people on Google’s campuses walking around with Google Glass.\n\nBut Google’s products don’t seem as convoluted and confusing as Microsoft’s products.\n\nRyan Block, a former editor at Engadget and a co-founder of Gdgt, a gadget Web site, believes that while Google products have their fair share of confusion, and while many of the people that work there are very tech-driven, the company seems to find a better balance between geek and design.\n\n“Google grew up post-Microsoft and post-Apple and had a frame of reference for taking the best of both of those cultures,” he said. “So the end result is a company that has a product-driven culture and an engineer-driven culture.”\n\nMicrosoft sees it differently. While I was interviewing Frank X. Shaw, Microsoft’s vice president for corporate communications, he pointed to how Google names its products as an example of consumer confusion.\n\n“We’re way better than Google: at least we don’t name our products jelly bean or coffee cake, where, from a consumer standpoint, that naming is completely opaque,” Mr. Shaw said, referring to the naming convention Google has used for its Android operating system. “When most people see Windows 8.1 and Windows 8, they know 8.1 has got to be newer.”\n\nMr. Shaw is right. Unless you’re an Android engineer, or a Google employee, it’s takes some digging to figure out what the latest Google operating system is called.\n\nGoogle’s tech culture does enable its employees to play more. In addition to the Google X labs, the company fosters the famous 20 Percent Time, which enables engineers to spend one day a week working on projects that aren’t in their job descriptions.\n\n“Google Now started as a 20 percent project with two folks on the Maps team, and since launching, has gone on to win several product design awards, including recognition from D&AD this year as well as winning Popular Science’s “Innovation of the Year” last year,” explained a Google spokesman said in an e-mail.\n\nBut these projects can have detriments on the company, too. Google takes the crown for most products killed within a single company: Google Buzz, the social network that preceded Google Plus; Google Reader, the RSS reader; Knol, which hoped to offer user-written articles on a range of topics; Dodgeball, the location-based service; and a very long list of other products. Google did not respond to a request for comment to this post.\n\nWhile Google offers a wide range of products, some of them named after desserts and many of them short-lived, the company’s products are usually free of clutter and often relatively easy to use. Which means Google is neither Microsoft or Apple. It is somewhere right in the middle.",

The former Georgian president and Putin foe who’s currently in the middle of an unlikely second act as a Ukrainian opposition leader and international fugitive had a dramatic standoff with the authorities after state security officers tried to arrest him at his apartment in Kiev. Saakashvili led them on a rooftop chase and at one point threatened to jump off his apartment building. After he was dragged away by the masked officers and put in a van, the vehicle was surrounded by his supporters who broke him out, despite attempts by the police to use teargas to disperse the crowd.\n\nSaakashvili then led his supporters to parliament where he gave a speech denouncing Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko as “the head of an organized crime gang.”\n\nWhat is this all about? Saakashvili first burst onto the world stage leading the pro-Western Rose Revolution in his native Georgia in 2003, after which he served as president of Georgia from 2004-2013. As president, he was lauded for liberal reforms but criticized for his increasingly autocratic governance. His fierce opposition to Putin culminated in the 2008 Russia-Georgia war, during which Georgia was invaded by Russian troops and lost territory. Saakashvili left office—and the country—in 2014, and is currently facing charges in Georgia that he says were trumped up by his political enemies.\n\nAfter a brief period hanging out in cafes in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, Saakashvili got a second act in politics in 2015 after Poroshenko, who took power after Ukraine’s pro-western uprising, made him governor of Odessa and granted him Ukrainian citizenship. But the two men fell out and Saakashvili quit last year, blaming Poroshenko for the slow pace of reform in Ukraine. Saakashvili was stripped of his Ukrainian citizenship in July, making him effectively stateless since he lost his Georgian citizenship when he took the Ukrainian one.\n\nIn September, he dramatically barged over the Poland-Ukrainian border back into Ukraine with a crowd of supporters. He now seems intent on leading a new color revolution, calling on Ukrainians to set up a protest camp in the capital unless Poroshenko is impeached. It’s not clear what crime he’s being charged with or if he would be tried in Ukraine or deported back to Georgia to face charges there, but today’s great escape will certainly help his revolutionary cred.",
  "latent_13031": "Passing away just over three years ago, the legendary Leslie Nielsen left us with a multitude of hilarious performances and perhaps aside from Airplane!, his most iconic character was that of Detective Frank Drebin in The Naked Gun franchise. While the film series itself was based on the ABC TV show Police Squad!, it’s about to get a modern update over at Paramount.\n\nAccording to Variety, the studio has set Ed Helms (who is also attached to a Vacation reboot) to step into the shots of Nielsen’s character, with Reno 911! duo Thomas Lennon and Robert Ben Garant writing the screenplay. There’s no other details on project, but this smells like a fairly useless cashgrab at first glance.\n\nHelms doesn’t seem like an ideal fit for the character, with a more comedic demeanor than Nielsen, who played the role with straight, hilarious conviction. If the studio perhaps got Zucker, Abrahams and Zucker involved we’d take notice, but as it stands now, it’s hard to get behind this remake. As we await more details, check out the original’s trailer below.\n\nDoes Helms make a good fit for a Naked Gun reboot?",
  "latent_13035": "I found Forks Over Knives online while looking for ways to naturally drop my “hereditary” high cholesterol, a diagnosis I received at age 25. My doctor told me that once I was done having kids, I needed to go on statin drugs. I had tried lots of diet changes, but nothing seemed to help. I had cut meat out of my diet, but I still ate fish and dairy—and my total cholesterol hit a high of 316! Finally after I had my second baby, I knew that I needed to either find something that worked or start taking cholesterol meds for the rest of my life.\n\nI went 100% plant-strong as a last-ditch effort—and my total cholesterol dropped 90 points in 8 months! My doctor was quite impressed and no longer recommended statins! My HDL number was fantastic, as well.\n\nNot only did going plant-strong have a huge impact on my cholesterol, it has helped me to finally drop extra baby weight effortlessly. In fact, I am now 20 pounds under my pre-pregnancy weight. I have always struggled with food addiction, binge eating, exercise and food obsession, and maintaining a healthy weight. Now I no longer obsess about food and exercising. I don’t feel deprived. I listen to my body and eat plant-strong until I am satiated. I have found many great blogs and recipe books to help make this a relatively easy (and tasty) transition for me. I am 5’3″ and now weigh 110 lbs., down from 148 lbs., which was a lot of weight on my petite frame!\n\nI am a 35-year-old single mom, and I run a business from home. In addition, I chase my kids (ages 1½ and 4½) from morning until night, manage my house and yard, and still have energy to run five miles whenever I get a kid-free hour. I have no doubt that being plant-strong helps me to have the energy to do everything I do.\n\nMy sister is another plant-strong success story. She changed her diet when she learned about my success, dropping her own “hereditary” high cholesterol by 80 points in four months.\n\nThank you to FOK for breaking through the noise of the traditional (non)solutions, like living on medications! I am so happy to be cholesterol-med-free and PLANT STRONG!",
  "latent_13079": "We look back at the cast members, characters and sketches that have sustained NBC’s gray lady of late night for more than three decades.\n\nWe look back at the cast members, characters and sketches that have sustained NBC’s gray lady of late night for more than three decades.\n\nIf there’s one show on television that makes expert critics of us all, it would be NBC’s “Saturday Night Live.” We’ve had so much practice — coming up on four decades — that it’s almost as if “SNL” exists mainly so viewers can dump on it.\n\nAlong the way, it has been “SNL’s” good fortune and bad luck to become an American institution saddled with obligations. I happen to enjoy “SNL” in a slump season because it feels like possibility; other viewers beat up on “SNL” for failing their expectations, which are surprisingly deep and complicated, given that it’s a comedy show.\n\nWe demand much — sometimes too much, I think — from “SNL.” A happy example would be how Facebook users demanded that Betty White host the show in 2010 and how executive producer-for-life Lorne Michaels gamely granted this wish.\n\nBut lately “SNL” has been faced with a more serious shortcoming, which also required public demand and swift remedy: Far too many seasons went by without a black woman in the cast, to the point where even the most dense viewer could notice the lack of diversity and missed opportunities for topical humor. Thus, auditions have been held and an as-yet-unnamed black woman reportedly will join the show in January, where she can participate in sketches that could elevate and illuminate the satire without playing down to stereotype or merely checking off a box. (Cross your fingers, girl.)\n\nAlthough we occasionally want “SNL” to reflect life back to us, most viewers still just want it to be funny. Or funny again, as some swear it used to be: Criticizing “SNL” almost always centers on a belief that the show was better two seasons ago, or four seasons ago, or back in 2004, in 1993, in 1987, and, most of all, in the mid- to late 1970s. It helps to have lived just long enough to remember for certain that “SNL” has never been fully brilliant in any year.\n\nAs proof, I predict the comments field below the online version of this review will soon fill up with complaints that “SNL” hasn’t been funny for (insert number of years here, often in direct proportion to when the commenter was in college) or that, in fact, it was never, ever funny. (For fun, I insist you read the online comments, as well as my review, in the voice of current cast member Taran Killam’s recently added “Weekend Update” character Jebidiah Atkinson, a mean-spirited 19th-century “speech critic” who ripped into Lincoln’s Gettysburg Address: “Four snores and seven yawns ago,” he sneered. “Let’s be honest, Abe, you dropped a real Lincoln log.”)\n\n“Saturday Night Live” was always a talent show and a train wreck at the same time, and even now, in one of its dreaded “rebuilding years” with a raft of new and newish cast members and featured players and a departing head writer (Seth Meyers, 39, off to host NBC’s “Late Night”), “SNL” manages to be funny — sometimes by luck, but just as often through skill.\n\nThe show is in many ways immune to criticisms about its wavering quality from era to era, mostly because its legend is built upon the art of improv, which understands that brilliance can be found in the pretty-good-try. The only way to truly enjoy “SNL” (in good years and bad) is to watch from a place of both habit and forgiving optimism; otherwise, all you’ll ever see — particularly this season so far — are the show’s consistent flaws.\n\nThese include innumerable sketches that peter out five seconds after they begin — a problem “SNL” has always grappled with, but is worse now. It’s also painful to watch attempts to launch new recurring characters in the void left by the recent departures of Bill Hader, Fred Armisen and Kristen Wiig.\n\nIt’s also tempting to resent the show’s sentimental habit of bringing “SNL” alums back for guest spots, as with Tina Fey hosting this season’s opener in September; or when Wiig showed up two weeks ago to reprise her magnificently goony “Dooneese” character as an oddball von Trapp child in a “Sound of Music Live!” spoof.\n\nIn one way you’re relieved to see them back; in another way it signals that the cycle is basically inert — as will probably be the case this Saturday, when alum and “Tonight Show” host-to-be Jimmy Fallon hosts with his overexposed buddy Justin Timberlake as musical guest. “Saturday Night Live” spends far too much of its time now being self-referential and nostalgic; sometimes it seems the only audience the cast members are playing to is themselves.\n\n“SNL” simply has too many friends asking for too many favors — evidenced by an endless stream of celebrity cameos that mainly serve to promote films starring alums or longtime friends of the show. When it’s like that, “SNL” reminds me of being part of a captive audience in a high school pep assembly, watching the popular kids act out their lame sketches.\n\nIn a weakened state, it’s also easier to notice “SNL’s” puzzling dependence on old premises, such as lampooning talk shows of the sort that no longer exist or only ever existed on “SNL” (“Girlfriends Talk Show”; “Lady Gaga’s [talk] Show”); or making very old hay out of the game-show genre (“New Cast Member or Arcade Fire?”; “Cartoon Catchphrase”). These set-ups no longer apply to “Saturday Night Live’s” original mission, which is to lampoon contemporary culture.\n\n* * *\n\nYet, despite the slump, “SNL” still offers the security of ritual — something of real value in a pop-culture era that worships disruption and upheaval. The show’s format is as inviolable as the Mass liturgy. (Mass, that is, if more than half the priests were Jewish.) It starts with the “cold open,” where “SNL” displays both its desire and its flailing inability to deliver relevant political satire, followed by monologue, sketches, a song, “Weekend Update,” more sketches, another song, and then, most delightfully, the back end of the show, which is an experimental playground for anyone still awake.\n\nWhat “SNL” has going for it — what it’s always had and remarkably retains — is its confidence in and surrender to youth, even though it is controlled by a 69-year-old man. Among the new (or relatively new) performers remains a sense of lark and pleasure in partaking in the show’s vaunted traditions. The women in the cast, especially, are harnessing a long-overdue interest in post-feminist comedy; they are beneficiaries of the work Fey, Wiig, Amy Poehler and Maya Rudolph (among others) did in the 2000s.\n\nKate McKinnon, 29, who came on as a featured player in 2012, proves her versatility in each episode, whether she’s playing a celebrity or a teacher or a politician (Kathleen Sebelius; Angela Merkel) or a dour foreigner (impoverished babushkas; Angela Merkel). She also excels at surreal, uncategorizable characters like Sheila Sovage, a barfly who throws herself at the last remaining customer at closing time.\n\nThe same praise applies to the superlative Vanessa Bayer, 32, who joined in 2010 and now finds herself capably shouldering sketches all through the show, the way Wiig used to, whether she’s playing Miley Cyrus or her greatest contribution to date, Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy, who comes onto “Weekend Update” and painfully, nervously sticks to a prepared text filled with Borscht Belt attempts to make his grown-up relatives laugh.\n\nCecily Strong, 29, will take over as “Weekend Update” anchor in January when Meyers departs; her co-anchoring this fall still feels a little flat and comes at a terrible price: So that she could play anchor, we’ve lost her best character, an “Update” commentator called the Girl You Wish You Hadn’t Started a Conversation With at a Party. (It’s a tragesty, Seth.)\n\nThe men are on less sturdy footing. Jay Pharoah, 26, patiently outlasted “SNL’s” ineptitude at utilizing its minority performers and now does a passable President Obama and a manically funny take on ESPN commentator Shannon Sharpe, among other characters. Killam, 31, can do anything, which means he has to do everything; it’s exhausting to watch him try to be Hader, Armisen and even Jason Sudeikis all at once. Bobby Moynihan, 36, is similarly good at filling gaps, but his characters — “Update” commentator Drunk Uncle among them — run too quickly into the ground. Kenan Thompson, who is only 35 but has been on the show for a decade, seems at long last bored with his own work — a feeling conveyed to the viewer.\n\nAnd though “SNL” was dinged for adding too many young white guys to its supporting cast this season (five of them), they’ve shown themselves to be funny and not entirely indistinguishable from one another if you pay attention, especially 29-year-old Beck Bennett (known to TV watchers as the stern businessman in the AT&T commercial who sits at a table and talks to kindergartners about cell phone coverage), who was very funny a couple of weeks ago as a chief executive who behaves like an 11-month-old baby.\n\n* * *\n\nThough their hearts (and theatrical training) belong to the live stage, today’s “SNL” performers tend to succeed most in the pre-recorded bits. Short film has been with the show since its earliest days (think Walter Williams’s “The Mr. Bill Show” all the way up through Robert Smigel’s dangerously funny and still missed “TV Funhouse” cartoon clips). The form took a huge and relevant leap forward when Andy Samberg and his collaborators delivered “SNL Digital Shorts,” and brought the show much-needed juice as a source of Internet fodder.\n\nThe millennial members of this cast and writing staff seem most naturally drawn to this genre, whether it’s in sustaining “SNL’s” tradition of pre-filmed commercial spoofs (“Autumn’s Eve pumpkin spice” feminine hygiene products; or a brutally spot-on fake ad for those tacky H&M clothing stores) or in weirder, one-off films. Bennett and another new featured player, Kyle Mooney, 29, seem most at home in this format, especially in a recent film in which two fraternity members explain their elaborate rules for beer pong.\n\nWhen you rewatch the first half of this current season (as I just did), the new style of humor seems plain as day: Eventually, it’s no longer going to be about over-the-top characters played again and again and again, the last of which may have gone away with Gen X-ers Wiig and Hader and Armisen — Dooneese the malformed sibling; Stefon the strung-out gay clubster; Garth and Kat, the singers who make up their songs as they go.\n\nWhat the new crop is very good at is playing awkward and comically pathetic people. They specialize in subtle, satirical portraiture (Jacob the Bar Mitzvah Boy; Girl You Wish You Hadn’t Started a Conversation With at a Party) that is more easily recognizable in the present era, in which any real-life situation can be turned into the day’s most unbelievable YouTube video courtesy of a witness and an iPhone. This is where today’s comedy is headed — not in celeb impressions and riffs off political news, but in smartly observed renditions of everyday people. I like “Saturday Night Live” best when it follows those instincts.\n\nWhere I don’t like the show anymore is when it is self-consciously meta, essentially becoming an episode of “Saturday Night Live” that is about doing an episode of “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nGoing meta is a bad habit, not just in “Saturday Night Live” but in nearly all forms of television now. Going meta is a way of girding yourself for the critics by pre-anticipating their complaints. When the show brought “Scandal” star Kerry Washington in as host last month, amid the growing shamefest about the lack of black women on “SNL’s” roster, the chief artistic theme was going meta: We’ll make fun of ourselves as a way of neutering an important and even institutional shortcoming. (The fact that Washington more or less aced the show was seen, by Monday morning, as a cultural victory and a proved point.)\n\nBut going meta is not just “SNL’s” crutch, it’s everyone’s crutch. I went meta near the top of this article — pre-swatting my critics before they even landed on my stinking pile. This is what it’s like to create anything in the digital age: You must apologize for your mediocrity in real time. As a result, we collectively regard the fourth wall the way prospective home buyers on HGTV treat the wall between dining rooms and kitchens — we tear that mother down completely.\n\n“Saturday Night Live” needs to do one last sketch about this — meta about meta about meta — and then get on with the necessary business of being “Saturday Night Live.”\n\nSaturday Night Live\n\n(90 minutes) hosted by Jimmy Fallon with musical guest Justin Timberlake, Saturday at 11:30 p.m. on NBC.",

  "latent_13342": "The Web Design Trends Series is brought to you by the Intel AppUp℠ Developer Program, which provides developers with everything they need to create and then sell their applications to millions of Intel Atom™ processor-based devices. Learn more here.\n\nThe world of web fonts and web typography is exploding. After years of struggle, we're finally at a point where using real fonts on the web is a viable option.\n\nFor web designers, this is huge news because it means a greater degree of control over how content is displayed. For end users, it means a richer web experience.\n\nThanks to web services like Typekit, Fonts.com Web Fonts, Webtype and others, the opportunities to integrate real fonts on the web is getting better all the time.\n\nLet's look at five of the biggest trends taking place with web font and web typography design.\n\n1. WOFF as a Standard\n\nThe Web Open Font Format, or WOFF, is edging ever closer to becoming the de facto standardized format for using fonts on the web.\n\nBacked by Mozilla, Opera and Microsoft, WOFF allows TrueType, OpenType or Open Font Format fonts to be embedded into web pages.\n\nRight now, WOFF support is built into Firefox 3.6 and above, Google Chrome version 5 and above, Internet Explorer 9, and will be supported in upcoming versions of Safari.\n\nJason Santa Maria and his Friends of Mighty built Lost World's Fairs as a way to showcase IE 9 and its support of WOFF. This fantastic piece of typographic web art really shows just how great type can be made to look on the web.\n\n2. Big Foundries Jump on Board\n\nWhen Adobe announced that they were partnering with Typekit back in August, it was a big move. Historically, the biggest font foundries have led the resistance against getting fonts on the web.\n\nAdobe's decision was followed recently by the new company, Webtype, a partnership of Ascender, Roger Black and Font Bureau. Similar to Typekit, Webtype offers a way for designers or end users to get high quality fonts for use in their own designs.\n\nLast week, Monotype Imaging formally launched Fonts.com Web Fonts and brought many of the most famous Monotype, Linotype and ITC font families to the web.\n\nAt this stage, nearly every major foundry is either offering fonts with web usage licenses or is considering making their fonts usable on the web. Eighteen months ago, that wouldn't have been a reality. Today it is.\n\n3. Better Letter Control with Lettering.js\n\nWhen creating the Lost World's Fairs project, Friends of Mighty realized they would need to have a way to better control individual letters and words to offer proper spacing and better kerning.\n\nThus, Lettering.js was born. Lettering.js is a JavaScript plugin that allows developers and designers to better control individual letters without having tons of messy markup.\n\nAs Dan Rubin recently remarked on Twitter, Lettering.js may just end up having a bigger impact on typography on the web than anyone is expecting.\n\n4. Mobile Support\n\nFonts.com Web Fonts service and Typekit both offer support for multiple mobile browsers. This continues to increase as more and more mobile browser makers support various aspects of @font-face and draft specifications like WOFF.\n\nIt's not just enough for fonts to look good on the desktop, as more and more web usage shifts to the smartphone, having readable, legible and properly spaced typography on mobile devices will be a bigger and bigger area of interest.\n\nAlready companies like Monotype and Typekit are working to make sure that fonts look their best on a number of different screen types and sizes.\n\n5. Font Support in Web Apps\n\nOne of the most interesting recent advancements in the web font world has been the ability to choose web fonts when customizing an aspect of a web app. Thanks to Typekit and Google's Web Font Directory, it's easy for developers to build these tools into their product.\n\nAlready many Tumblr themes are coming with Typekit support and new web services like About.me give users the option to customize their typefaces for various aspects of their profile.\n\nThis is a great use of typography on the web because it gives end-users direct interaction with fonts and lets them see directly how different fonts look together and at different sizes.\n\nWeb typography is on a tear and we're at the beginning of a new era of a more beautiful, more legible and more customizable web.\n\nSeries supported by Intel AppUp℠ Developer Program\n\nThe Web Design Trends Series is brought to you by the Intel AppUp℠ Developer Program, which provides developers with everything they need to create and then sell their applications to millions of Intel Atom™ processor-based devices.

  "latent_13386": "A clinical trial using genetically-modified white blood cells is now underway in China for lung cancer.\n\nThe trial, led by Dr. You Lu at the West China Hospital, enrols patients with advanced lung cancer, for whom chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and other treatments have failed.\n\nWhat has grabbed headlines around the world is the way the trial proposes to modify the white blood cells – by using what’s called “CRISPR”. You can think of CRISPR as very precise molecular scissors. It allows researchers to edit DNA by cutting out, or adding in, different sequences.\n\nIn this clinical trial, Dr. Lu and his team are using CRISPR to cut out the gene for “PD-1” in white blood cells (more specifically, a type of white blood cell called T-cells).\n\nPD-1 is present on the surface of T-cells to stop T-cells from attacking healthy cells in your body. While under normal circumstances this is very useful, cancer cells have taken advantage of this system to “escape” from being attacked by T-cells. So, if PD-1 is deleted from the T-cells, then the T-cells could recognize and defeat the cancer.\n\nSo what does this treatment involve? First, the researchers will take blood from the patients, and then collect the T-cells from the blood. Then, they will knockout the PD-1 gene from these cells using CRISPR. The researchers will then multiply the edited cells in the lab, and then inject the cells back into the patient’s bloodstream. These cells should home-in on the cancer cells, and subsequently kill them.\n\nTwo FDA-approved drugs, called Nivolumab (trade name: Opdivo) and Pembrolizumab (trade name: Keytruda), also target PD-1, but only by binding to it. This is not as extreme as deleting the gene for PD-1 altogether, which is what Dr. Lu is proposing in his trial using CRISPR. So hopefully, the CRISPR method would be even more effective in treating cancer than these drugs.\n\nAt this very early stage of clinical trials (“Phase 1”), the aim of the study is primarily to study the safety of the treatment, and to determine what doses can be tolerated by the patients. Only a small number of participants will be recruited (10-15 patients), and they will be followed for 6 months to see whether the treatment has any adverse side-effects.\n\nSome possible side-effects may be an excessive autoimmune response, where the T-cells start attacking healthy organs, given the role of PD-1. However, for all intents and purposes, cancer cells are technically “foreign” cells in the body, so the edited T-cells should attack them more than they do healthy ones. Hopefully with the right dose, the researchers can maximise the attack on the cancer cells, with minimal damage on healthy organs. At this early stage, this is merely speculation – no results from this trial have been reported so far.\n\nHere’s a link to the trial and the criteria for entry into the study, if you are interested in learning more.\n\nThis clinical trial marks the first use of CRISPR in humans. Many more developments of CRISPR in cancer therapy are on the horizon. Three clinical trials to knockout PD-1 using CRISPR to treat bladder, prostrate, and renal cancers has been proposed in China, currently pending approval. There has also been talks of a clinical trial starting in the US this year to knockout 3 different genes (one of which is also PD-1) using CRISPR, although the details of this are currently not available.\n\nArticle edited by Jack Simpson.\n\nFeature photo designed by Freepik",

  "latent_13803": "The idea of a transcontinental railroad had existed since the 1830s, but attempts in the 1840s to organize the construction of one failed due to funding and logistical problems. The California Gold Rush of 1849 lured thousands of men to the Pacific Coast, increasingly the need for a transcontinental line.In 1856, engineer Theodore Judah completed the first railroad line west of the Missouri River, the Sacramento Valley Line connecting the California capital to Folsom, Calif. But Judah has much larger plans for a transcontinental railroad, which he laid out in 1857 in “ A Practical Plan for Building the Pacific Railroad .”“It is the most magnificent project ever conceived,” he wrote. “It connects these two great oceans. It is an indissoluble bond of union between the populous States of the East, and the undeveloped regions of the fruitful West. It is a highway which leads to peace and future prosperity. An iron bond for the perpetuation of the Union and independence which we now enjoy.”In 1860 he discovered that the infamous Donner Pass was a suitable train route through the Sierra Nevada, which has been one of the great obstacles in building a western railroad. Judah and a group of five investors formed the Central Pacific Railroad Company and traveled to Washington to lobby Congress for funding.In 1862 President Abraham Lincoln signed the Pacific Railroad Act into law , granting appropriations and land to Central Pacific and the newly chartered Union Pacific Railroad Company. The act called for the Central Pacific to build a railroad from California to the east, while the Union Pacific worked from the Missouri River to the west. Each company would receive $48,000 in bonds per mile built and agree to connect the railways when they reached each other.Work began later that year; the Union Pacific relied heavily on labor from Irish, German and Italian immigrants, while the Central Pacific used primarily Chinese laborers . The Chinese represented 90 percent of CP’s final workforce, and were paid less than white workers until a 1867 strike earned them higher wages and better working conditions.The most difficult stage of construction was through the Sierra Nevada , where the Central Pacific laborers worked through the cold and heavy snow to build 13 tunnels. Tunnel No. 6, which was 1,659 feet long and stood more than 7,000 feet above sea level, had to be “hand-carved, without electricity and without steam-powered tools,” reports PBS.",
  "latent_13826": "[+]Enlarge Calculated optimized structures and energetic ordering of three detected IrO4 isomers; IrO4+ with iridium in the +9 oxidation state (left) is the most energetically favored isomer. Credit: Adapted from Nature\n\nThe oxidation state of an atom in a molecule is an important means of electron bookkeeping and determining structure and bonding, so the question of just how high oxidation states can go has long piqued chemists’ interest. That ceiling has now reached what was once believed to be an impossibly high level with the preparation of IrO 4 +, the first example of a molecule with an oxidation state of +9.\n\n“Wow. The discovery that chemical compounds in the +9 oxidation state may be stable enough to isolate is provocative, to say the least,” says Gregory S. Girolami, an inorganic chemist at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign. “If confirmed, the iridium compound would be a worthy member of the elite list of chemical species, such as noble-gas compounds, that exist despite once being thought permanently ‘nonexistable.’ ”\n\nThe highest observed oxidation state had been +8, which occurs in only a few tetroxide compounds—RuO 4 , OsO 4 , IrO 4 , and XeO 4 . These are molecules in which the central atom has plenty of valence electrons to give away and the high charge can be stabilized by small, highly electronegative ligands such as fluorine or oxygen. Among the +8 molecules, IrO 4 stands out because the central iridium atom still has one more 5d valence electron to give.\n\nResearchers led by Sebastian Riedel of Albert Ludwigs University, in Freiburg, Germany; Mingfei Zhou of Fudan University, in Shanghai; Jun Li of Tsinghua University, in Beijing; and Gary J. Schrobilgen of McMaster University, in Hamilton, Ontario, have now coaxed iridium to go all the way (Nature 2014, DOI: 10.1038/nature13795).\n\nTo make IrO 4 +, Zhou’s group blasted an iridium metal target with a pulsed laser in an argon atmosphere spiked with O 2 . The researchers studied the reaction products by mass spectrometry and infrared photodissociation spectroscopy. By coupling experimental work by Zhou’s group and computational modeling by Riedel’s and Li’s groups, the researchers determined that the most stable IrO 4 + isomer has tetrahedral geometry and four terminal Ir=O bonds.\n\nSchrobilgen’s group attempted to synthesize an isolable IrO 4 + salt by treating iridium oxides with strong oxidizing reagents such as O 2 SbF 6 and XeF 6 . The researchers haven’t found the right combination to make isolable IrO 4 + so far, but they haven’t given up trying.",

There are 104 of these reactors in the USA and 195 in Europe. Imagine what havoc it would wreak on our civilization and the planet’s ecosystems if we were to suddenly witness not just one or two nuclear melt-downs but 400 or more! How likely is it that our world might experience an event that could ultimately cause hundreds of reactors to fail and melt down at approximately the same time? I venture to say that, unless we take significant protective measures, this apocalyptic scenario is not only possible but probable.\n\nConsider the ongoing problems caused by three reactor core meltdowns, explosions, and breached containment vessels at Japan’s Fukushima Daiichi facility, and the subsequent health and environmental issues. Consider the millions of innocent victims that have already died or continue to suffer from horrific radiation-related health problems (“Chernobyl AIDS”, epidemic cancers, chronic fatigue, etc) resulting from the Chernobyl reactor explosions, fires, and fallout. If just two serious nuclear disasters, spaced 25 years apart, could cause such horrendous environmental catastrophes, it is hard to imagine how we could ever hope to recover from hundreds of similar nuclear incidents occurring simultaneously across the planet. Since more than one third of all Americans live within 50 miles of a nuclear power plant, this is a serious issue that should be given top priority![1]\n\nIn the past 152 years, Earth has been struck roughly 100 solar storms causing significant geomagnetic disturbances (GMD), two of which were powerful enough to rank as “extreme GMDs”. If an extreme GMD of such magnitude were to occur today, in all likelihood it would initiate a chain of events leading to catastrophic failures at the vast majority of our world’s nuclear reactors, quite similar to the disasters at both Chernobyl and Fukushima, but multiplied over 100 times. When massive solar flares launch a huge mass of highly charged plasma (a coronal mass ejection, or CME) directly towards Earth, colliding with our planet’s outer atmosphere and magnetosphere, the result is a significant geomagnetic disturbance.\n\nCoronal Mass Ejection (CME), SOHO image, June 9, 2002.\n\nSince an extreme GMD of such a potentially disruptive magnitude that it would collapse the grid across most of the US last occurred in May of 1921, long before the advent of modern electronics, widespread electric power grids, and nuclear power plants, we are for the most part blissfully unaware of this threat and totally unprepared for its consequences. The good news is that relatively affordable equipment and processes could be installed to protect critical components in the electric power grid and its nuclear reactors, thereby averting this “end-of-the-world-as-we-know-it” scenario. The bad news is that even though panels of scientists and engineers have studied the problem, and the bi-partisan congressional EMP commission has presented a list of specific recommendations to congress, our leaders have yet to approve and implement a single significant preventative measure!\n\nMost of us believe something like this could never happen, and if it could, certainly our “authorities” would do everything in their power to make sure they would prevent such an Apocalypse from ever taking place. Unfortunately, the opposite is true. “How could this happen?” you might ask. “Is this truly possible?” Read and weep, for you will soon know the answer.\n\nNuclear Power Plants and the Electric Power Grid\n\nOur global system of electrical power generation and distribution (“the grid”), upon which every facet of our modern life is utterly dependent, in its current form is extremely vulnerable to severe geomagnetic storms of a magnitude that tends to strike our planet on an average of approximately once every 70 to 100 years. We depend on this grid to maintain food production and distribution, telecommunications, Internet services, medical services, military defense, transportation, government, water treatment, sewage and garbage removal, refrigeration, oil refining and gas pumping, and to conduct all forms of commerce.\n\nUnfortunately, the world’s nuclear power plants, as they are currently designed, are critically dependent upon maintaining connection to a functioning electrical grid, for all but relatively short periods of electrical blackouts, in order to keep their reactor cores continuously cooled so as to avoid catastrophic reactor core meltdowns and spent fuel rod storage pond fires.\n\nIf an extreme GMD were to cause widespread grid collapse (which it most certainly will), in as little as one or two hours after each nuclear reactor facility’s backup generators either fail to start, or run out of fuel, the reactor cores will start to melt down. After a few days without electricity to run the cooling system pumps, the water bath covering the spent fuel rods stored in “spent fuel ponds” will boil away, allowing the stored fuel rods to melt down and burn [2]. Since the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) currently mandates that only one week’s supply of backup generator fuel needs to be stored at each reactor site, it is likely that after we witness the spectacular night-time celestial light show from the next extreme GMD we will have about one week in which to prepare ourselves for Armageddon.\n\nTo do nothing is to behave like ostriches with our heads in the sand, blindly believing that “everything will be okay,” as our world inexorably drifts towards the next naturally recurring, 100% inevitable, super solar storm and resultant extreme GMD. The result of which in short order will end the industrialized world as we know it, incurring almost incalculable suffering, death, and environmental destruction on a scale not seen since the extinction of the dinosaurs some 65 million years ago.\n\nThe End of “The Grid” As We Know It\n\nThere are records from the 1850s to today of roughly one hundred significant geomagnetic solar storms, two of which in the last 25 years were strong enough to cause millions of dollars worth of damage to key components that keep our modern grid powered. In March of 1989, a severe solar storm induced powerful electric currents in grid wiring that fried a main power transformer in the HydroQuebec system, causing a cascading grid failure that knocked out power to 6 million customers for nine hours while also damaging similar transformers in New Jersey and the United Kingdom. More recently, in 2003 a solar storm of lesser intensity, but longer duration, caused a blackout in Sweden and induced powerful currents in the South African grid that severely damaged or destroyed fourteen of their major power transformers, impairing commerce and comfort over major portions of that country as they were forced to resort to massive rolling blackouts that dragged on for many months[3].\n\nTransformer at the Salem Nuclear Plant, damaged by March 1989 solar storm[4].\n\nDuring the Great Geomagnetic Storm of May 14-15, 1921, brilliant aurora displays were reported in the Northern Hemisphere as far south as Mexico and Puerto Rico, and in the Southern Hemisphere as far north as Samoa[5]. This extreme GMD produced ground currents roughly ten times as strong as the 1989 Quebec incident. Just 62 years earlier, the great granddaddy of recorded GMDs, referred to as “The Carrington Event,” raged from August 28 to September 4, 1859. This extreme GMD induced currents so powerful that telegraph lines, towers, and stations caught on fire at a number of locations around the world. Best estimates are that the Carrington Event was approximately 50% stronger than the Great Geomagnetic Storm of 1921[6]. Since we are headed into an active solar period, much like the one preceding the Carrington Event, scientists are concerned that conditions could be ripe for the next extreme GMD[7].\n\nPrior to the advent of the microchip and modern extra-high-voltage (EHV) transformers (key grid components that were first introduced in the late 1960’s), most electrical systems were relatively robust and resistant to the effects of GMDs. Given the fact that a simple electrostatic spark can fry a microchip, and many thousands of miles of power lines act like giant antennas for capturing massive amounts of GMD spawned electromagnetic energy, the electrical systems of the modern world are far more vulnerable than their predecessors.\n\nThe federal government recently sponsored a detailed scientific study to more fully understand the extent to which critical components of our national electrical power grid might be effected by either a naturally occurring GMD or a man-made EMP. Under the auspices of the EMP Commission and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), and reviewed in depth by the Oakridge National Laboratory and the National Academy of Sciences, Metatech corporation undertook extensive modeling and analysis of the potential effects of extreme geomagnetic storms upon the U.S. electrical power grid. Based upon a storm of intensity equal to the Great Geomagnetic Storm of 1921, Metatech estimated that within the US induced voltage and current spikes, combined with harmonic anomalies, would severely damage or destroy over 350 EHV power transformers critical to the functioning of the U.S. grid, and possibly well over 2000 EHV transformers worldwide.[4]\n\nEHV transformers are custom designed for each installation and are made to order, weighing as much as 300 tons each, and costing well over US 1$ million each. Given the fact that there is currently a three year waiting list for a single EHV transformer (due to recent demand from China and India, the lead times have grown from one to three years), and that the total global manufacturing capacity is roughly 100 EHV transformers per year when the world’s manufacturing centers are functioning properly, you can begin to grasp the dire implications of this situation.\n\nGrowth of the US High Voltage Transmission Network and the Annual Electric Energy [4]\n\nThe loss of thousands of EHV transformers worldwide would cause a catastrophic collapse of the grid, stretching across much of the industrialized world. It will take years at best for the industrialized world to put itself back together after such an event, especially considering the fact that most of the manufacturing centers that make this equipment will also be grappling with widespread grid failure.\n\nOur Nuclear “Achilles Heel”\n\n“Five years ago I visited the still highly contaminated areas of Ukraine and the Belarus border where much of the radioactive plume from Chernobyl descended on 26 April 1986. I challenge chief scientist John Beddington and environmentalists like George Monbiot or any of the pundits now downplaying the risks of radiation to talk to the doctors, the scientists, the mothers, children and villagers who have been left with the consequences of a major nuclear accident. It was grim. We went from hospital to hospital and from one contaminated village to another. We found deformed and genetically mutated babies in the wards; pitifully sick children in the homes; adolescents with stunted growth and dwarf torsos; fetuses without thighs or fingers and villagers who told us every member of their family was sick. This was 20 years after the accident, but we heard of many unusual clusters of people with rare bone cancers…. Villages testified that ‘the Chernobyl necklace’—thyroid cancer—was so common as to be unremarkable.”\n\n— John Vidal, “Nuclear’s Green Cheerleaders Forget Chernobyl at Our Peril,” Guardian. co.uk, April 1, 2011[8]\n\nSo what do extended grid blackouts have to do with potential nuclear catastrophes? Nuclear power plants are designed to disconnect automatically from the grid in the event of a local power failure or major grid anomaly, and once disconnected they begin the process of shutting down the reactor’s core. In the event of the loss of coolant flow to an active nuclear reactor’s core, the reactor will start to melt down and fail catastrophically within a matter of a few hours at most. In an extreme GMD, nearly every reactor in the world could be affected.\n\nIt was a short-term cooling system failure that caused the partial reactor core melt-down in March 1979 at Three Mile Island, Pennsylvania. Similarly, according to Japanese authorities it was not direct damage from Japan’s 9.0 magnitude Tohoku Earthquake on March 11, 2011 that caused the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactor disaster, but the loss of electric power to the reactor’s cooling system pumps when the reactor’s backup batteries and diesel generators were wiped out by the ensuing tidal waves. In the hours and days after the tidal waves shuttered the cooling systems, the cores of reactors number 1, 2, and 3 were in full meltdown and released hydrogen gas, fueling explosions which breached several reactor containment vessels and blew the roof off the building housing the spent fuel storage pond of reactor number 4.\n\nOf even greater danger and concern than the reactor cores themselves are the spent fuel rods stored in on-site cooling ponds. Lacking a permanent spent nuclear fuel storage facility, so-called “temporary” nuclear fuel containment ponds are features common to nearly all nuclear reactor facilities. They typically contain the accumulated spent fuel from 10 or more decommissioned reactor cores. Due to lack of a permanent repository, most of these fuel containment ponds are greatly overloaded and tightly packed beyond original design. They are generally surrounded by common light industrial buildings, with concrete walls and corrugated steel roofs. Unlike the active reactor cores, which are encased inside massive “containment vessels” with thick walls of concrete and steel, the buildings surrounding spent fuel rod storage ponds would do practically nothing to contain radioactive contaminants in the event of prolonged cooling system failures.\n\nSince spent fuel ponds typically hold far greater quantities of highly radioactive material then the active nuclear reactors locked inside reinforced containment vessels, they clearly present far greater potential for the catastrophic spread of highly radioactive contaminants over huge swaths of land, polluting the environment for multiple generations spanning hundreds of years. A study by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) determined that the “boil down time” for spent fuel rod containment ponds runs from between 4 and 22 days after loss of cooling system power before degenerating into a Fukushima-like situation, depending upon the type of nuclear reactor and how recently its latest batch of fuel rods had been decommissioned[9].\n\nReactor fuel rods have a protective zirconium cladding, which if superheated while exposed to air will burn with intense self-generating heat, much like a magnesium fire, releasing highly radioactive aerosols and smoke. According to Arnie Gundersen, former Senior Vice President for Nuclear Engineering Services Corporation, now turned nuclear whistle-blower, once a zirconium fire has started, due to its extreme temperatures and high degree of reactivity, contact with water will result in the water dissociating into hydrogen and oxygen gases, which will almost certainly lead to violent explosions. Gundersen says that once a zirconium fuel rod fire has started, the worst thing you could do is to try to quench the fire with water streams, since this action will only make matters worse and lead to violent explosions. Gundersen believes the massive explosion that blew the roof off the spent fuel pond at Fukushima was caused by zirconium induced hydrogen dissociation[10].\n\nHad it not been for heroic efforts on the part of Japan’s nuclear workers to replenish waters in the spent fuel pool at Fukushima, those spent fuel rods would have melted down and ignited their zirconium cladding, which most likely would have released far more radioactive contamination than what came from the three reactor core melt-downs. Japanese officials have estimate that the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster has already released into the local environment just over half the total radioactive contamination as was released by Chernobyl, but other sources estimate it could be significantly more than was released by the accident at Chernobyl. In the event that an extreme GMD induced long-term grid collapse covering much of the globe, if just half of the world’s spent fuel ponds were to boil off their water and become radioactive zirconium fed infernos, the ensuing contamination could far exceed the cumulative effect of 400 Chernobyls.\n\nElectromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack\n\n“Many of the control systems we considered achieved optimal connectivity through Ethernet cabling. EMP coupling of electrical transients to the cables proved to be an important vulnerability during threat illumination…. The testing and analysis indicate that the electronics could be expected to see roughly 100 to 700 ampere current transients on typical Ethernet cables. Effects noted in EMP testing occurred at the lower end of this scale. The bottom line observation at the end of the testing was that every system failed when exposed to the simulated EMP environment.”\n\n— Report of the Commission to Asses the Threat to the United States from Electromagnetic Pulse (EMP) Attack[11]\n\nElectromagnetic pulses (EMPs) and solar super storms are two different, but related, categories of events that are often described as high-impact, low frequency (HILF) events. Events categorized as HILF don’t happen very often, but if and when they do they have the potential to severely affect the lives of many millions of people. Think of an EMP as a super-powerful radio wave capable of inducing damaging voltage spikes in electrical wires and electronic devices across vast geographical areas. (Note that the geomagnetic effects of solar storms are also described as “natural EMP”.)\n\nWhat is generally referred to as an EMP strike is the deliberate detonation of a nuclear device at a high altitude, roughly defined as somewhere between 24 and 240 miles (40 and 400 kilometers) above the surface of the earth. Nuclear detonations of this type have the potential to cause serious damage to electronics and electrical power grids along their line of sight, covering huge distances on the order of a circular area 1,500 miles (2,500 kilometers) in diameter, which would correspond to an area stretching roughly from Quebec City in Canada down to Dallas, Texas.\n\nIllustrative EMP effects—Fast Pulse E1 Effects. [11]\n\nThe concern is that some rogue state or terrorist organization might build their own nuclear device from scratch or buy one illegally, procure a Scud missile (or similar) on the black market and launch their nuclear device from a large fishing boat or freighter somewhere off the coast of the US, causing grid collapse and widespread damage to electronic devices across roughly 50% of America. Much like an extreme GMD, a powerful EMP attack would also cause widespread grid collapse, but it would be limited to a much smaller geographical area.\n\nA powerful EMP from a sub-orbital nuclear detonation would cause extreme electromagnetic effects, starting with an initial short duration “speed of light” pulse, referred to as an “E1” effect, followed by a middle duration pulse called an “E2” effect, which is followed by a longer duration disturbance known as an “E3” effect. The “E1” effect lasts on the order of a few nanoseconds, and is quite similar to massive discharges of electrostatic sparks, which are particularly damaging to digital microelectronic chips that are at the core of most modern electronic equipment.\n\nThe intermediate “E2” effects last a fraction of a second, and are similar to many thousands to millions of lightning strikes hitting over a widespread area at almost exactly the same time. In the case of a nuclear induced EMP, its E3 effect starts after about a half second and may continue for several minutes. The E3 effect can be thought of as a “long slow burn”, and electromagnetically it is quite similar to the effects from an extreme GMD, except that the latter may continue for a number of hours or days.\n\nA “successful” EMP attack launched against the US would most likely result in the immediate collapse of the grid across roughly 50% of the country, crash the stock market, and cause critical failures in many of the electronic systems in affected areas that control nuclear reactors, chemical plants, telecommunications systems and industrial processes. These systems include programmable logic controllers (PLC), digital control systems (DCS), and supervisory control and data acquisition systems (SCADA).\n\nThe only good news about EMP strike is that its effect will cover a much smaller area than an extreme GMD, so there will be a significant portion of the rest of the US, as well as the rest of the outside world, left intact and able to lend a hand towards rebuilding critical infrastructure in the affected areas. Imagine the near total loss of a functioning infrastructure across an area of about a million square miles (approximately 1.6 million square kilometers, roughly equivalent to 50 Hurricane Katrinas happening simultaneously) and you will have some idea of the potentially crippling effect of an EMP attack from a single medium sized sub-orbital nuclear detonation!\n\nPreventing Armageddon\n\nThe congressionally mandated EMP Commission has studied the threat of both EMP and extreme GMD events, and made recommendations to the US congress to implement protective devices and procedures to insure the survival of the grid and other critical infrastructures in either event. John Kappenman, author of the Metatech study, estimates that it would cost on the order of $1 billion to build special protective devices into the US grid to protect its EHV transformers from EMP or extreme GMD damage, and to build stores of critical replacement parts should some of these items be damaged or destroyed. Kappenman estimates that it would cost significantly less than $1 billion to store at least a year’s worth of diesel fuel for backup generators at each US nuclear facility and to store sets of critical spare parts, such as backup generators, inside EMP-hardened steel containers to be available for quick change-out in the event that any of these items were damaged by an EMP or GMD[12].\n\nFor the cost of a single B-2 bomber or a tiny fraction of the TARP bank bailout, we could invest in preventative measures to avert what might well become the end of our civilization and life as we know it! There is no way to protect against all possible effects from an extreme GMD or an EMP attack, but certainly we could implement measures to protect against the worst effects. Since 2008, Congress has narrowly failed to pass legislation that would implement at least some of the EMP Commission’s recommendations[13].\n\nWe have a long ways to go to make our world EMP and GMD safe. Every citizen can do their part to push for legislation to move towards this goal, and to work inside our homes and communities to develop local resilience and self reliance, so that in the event of a long term grid-down scenario, we might make the most of a bad situation. The same tools that are espoused by the “Transition Movement” for developing local self-reliance and resilience to help cope with the twin effects of climate change and peak oil could also serve communities well in the event of an EMP attack or extreme GMD. If our country were to implement safeguards to protect our grid and nuclear power plants from EMP, it would also eliminate the primary incentive for a terrorist to launch an EMP attack. The sooner we take these actions the less chance that an EMP attack will occur!\n\nFor more information, or to get involved, see http://empactamerica.org/, http://survive-emp.com/, and http://www.transitionnetwork.org/ or contact your congressman at http://www.contactingthecongress.org/.\n\nNOTE: a longer version of this article, with 50% more references and footnotes, may be found at http://whentechfails.com/node/1545 , and a similar article, as published in the Feb/Mar 2012 issue of Nexus magazine, may be found at http://www.matstein.com/wp-content/uploads/SteinArticleNexus19021.pdf .\n\nNOTES:\n\n[1] Bill Dedman, “Nuclear Neighbors: Population Rises Near Nuclear Reactors,” MSNBC.com.

Thanks to a little help from Topo Chico Instagram photos, it's not hard to find the 22 reasons people are so dedicated to this drink. Photo: SAEN Photo: SAEN Image 1 of / 30 Caption Close Texas favorite Topo Chico gets some national love 1 / 30 Back to Gallery\n\nThe New York Times this week took notice of Topo Chico, that Texas cult favorite mineral water that is said to be the most reliable hangover cure besides the actual hair of the dog.\n\nPairing a tall, cold bottle of the stuff and say, two barbacoa tacos, can cure you of whatever is ailing you -- a hangover, a breakup, a death in the family, losing a bidding war on eBay for a Lone Star Beer hat.\n\nIt can be like one of Willy Wonka's fizzy lifting drinks for your body, but without nearly being beheaded in a bubble-stack with your grandfather.\n\nRELATED: 13 things with a Mexican flavor you can buy at Fiesta\n\nIt's been bottled since 1895, coming from a spring at the foot of the Cerro del Topo Chico in Monterrey, Mexico.\n\nIt's been said that it aids in the digestive process but that's yet to be medically proven, just as there is no definitive proof that Whataburger is an antidepressant.\n\nRELATED: Texas cult favorite Topo Chico mineral water celebrates 120 years, this is why people love it\n\nKate Murphy with the New York Times took a long look at the cult of Topo Chico this week, with even Justin Yu, owner of Houston's award-winning restaurant Oxheart, chiming in with his love of the brand.\n\nThe product's American distributor, Interex, based in Fort Worth, told Murphy that it is available in about 29 states but only in limited quantities. That could change soon if Murphy's piece sparks enough interest.\n\n\"This super bubbly agua mineral, in retro green-tinted glass bottles, has developed a fervent following here in Texas,\" Murphy writes.\n\nThat's an understatement in some circles.\n\nRELATED: 25 Mexican products Houstonians can't live without\n\n\"Devotees stock entire refrigerators with the stuff and tattoo themselves with the brand's logo, an Aztec princess who legend has it was healed by drinking the water, which emanates from an inactive volcano in Monterrey,\" Murphy writes.\n\nWe're not looking forward to the Topo shortages to come.",
  "latent_14008": "Image caption The Falklands row has sparked protests in recent weeks in Argentina\n\nA group of Argentine intellectuals has challenged the government's ambition to take control of the Falkland Islands from the British.\n\nThe 17 writers urged the government to recognise the right of the islanders to decide their own future.\n\nThey also say Argentina's demand for negotiations with the UK contradicts its insistence on sovereignty.\n\nTension has been rising in the run-up to the 30th anniversary of the war the two countries fought over the islands.\n\nThe intellectuals issued a joint statement titled An Alternative Vision of the Malvinas (Falklands).\n\nAmong the signatories are the journalist Jorge Lanata, historians Luis Alberto Romero and Hilda Sabato, cultural critic Beatriz Sarlo, and constitutional law expert Daniel Sabsay.\n\n'Nationalist agitation'\n\nThey argued that the government's actions were out of proportion to the importance of the issue, and had little relation to the \"major political, social and economic problems\" the country faces.\n\n\"A climate of nationalist agitation driven once again by both governments seems to be affecting a great number of our leaders from both the government and opposition,\" the document said.\n\nIt argued that Argentine society had still not faced up to its responsibility for the invasion of the Falklands in 1982, and should recognise that the use of force was \"unjustifiable\".\n\nIt pointed out that Argentina's demand for bilateral negotiations with the UK including the issue of sovereignty contradicted the insistence - enshrined in the national constitution - that Argentina's claim to sovereignty was \"non-negotiable\".\n\nThe statement urged genuine dialogue with the UK and the Falkland Islanders, and a recognition that the islanders have the right to self-determination.\n\n\"Respecting their way of life means giving up the intention to impose on them a sovereignty, citizenship and government they don't want,\" it said.\n\n'Traitors'\n\nMany Argentine web users have reacted negatively to the statement.\n\nReaders posting comments on the website of the newspaper La Nacion rejected the arguments, with some labelling the authors \"traitors\" and \"sell-outs\".\n\nArgentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's government has stepped up its diplomatic campaign to assert sovereignty over the islands in recent months, rallying regional support and accusing the UK of \"militarising\" the South Atlantic.\n\nBritain, which has controlled the islands since 1833, has said there can be no negotiations on sovereignty as long as the Falkland Islanders wish to remain British.\n\nOn 2 April, both nations will mark the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War, which began with an Argentine invasion of the islands and ended in victory for a British task force sent to recover them.",
  "latent_14040": "Knight Frank Global House Price Index (annual % growth)\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nGlobal house price inflation continues to slow, with annual growth standing at 4.8% during Q2 2008, down from 6.1% in the previous quarter\n\nLithuania, Denmark and New Zealand have joined the group of countries where house prices are now falling quickly\n\nPrices in Latvia continue to plummet, with values now 24.1% below the same time last year, the steepest drop in the index\n\nFor the fourth consecutive quarter Bulgaria tops the index, with growth of 32.2% over the year\n\nSlovakia, Russia, the Czech Republic and Hong Kong all recorded strong annual growth of over 25%\n\nAnnual residential property price inflation fell to 4.8% during the second quarter of 2008, down from 6.1% in the first quarter of the year. Prices are now falling in almost half the markets listed in the Knight Frank Global House Price Index, although growth rates in double figures are still being recorded in eight markets – Bulgaria, Slovakia, Russia, the Czech Republic, Hong Kong, Singapore, Cyprus and Colombia. Nevertheless, this presents a considerable contrast to a year ago, when double-figure house price inflation was seen in over a third of the markets covered. The economies of central and south-eastern Europe appear to be the strongest performers, while northern Europe (including the Baltic States), together with the United States, are suffering the most.\n\nNick Barnes, head of international research, Knight Frank, commented:“The Knight Frank Global House Price Index shows that global house price inflation is continuing to fall back, with much of continental Europe now seeing low or negative growth. Nevertheless, performance is very varied, with prices still rising rapidly in several locations in Asia and Eastern Europe.\n\n“Bulgaria is at the head of this list, where values have grown at 32.3% over the past year, and have now risen by 68% over the past two years. Admittedly this occurred from a low base, but demand from international investors and domestic economic growth remain strong, although there are fears of oversupply, particularly in the resort locations. Strong performance in Slovakia and the Czech Republic is also driven by robust economic growth.\n\n“The rapidly depreciating housing markets of the Baltic States – led by Latvia, where prices fell by 24.1% over the past year, demonstrate that rising inflation and mortgage costs are real risks for the emerging economies of Europe, particularly those that have seen high levels of investment activity over recent years. However, housing markets in countries such as Spain, Denmark, the UK and Ireland are all being severely challenged by the global credit squeeze.”\n\nThe country by country summary that follows provides an insight to the shifts currently taking place in house prices across the world:\n\nEurope:\n\nSince Q2 2007, foreign direct investment and a growing manufacturing base have combined with its appeal as a holiday home location to make Bulgaria the best performing location in the Knight Frank Global House Price Index. Its current annual growth of 32.2% is only slightly lower than the 33.7% recorded in the first quarter.\n\nA booming economy – GDP rose by 10.4% in 2007 alone – is the major factor behind the performance of Slovakia, where prices have grown by 25.4% over the past year. The highest rates of growth were seen in Košice (58.6%), Nitra (58.1%) and Prešov (54.8%), while the Bratislava region showed an increase of 27.2%. Flats (34.2%) have gone up in value far faster than houses (18.5%) and villas (3.2%). Economic growth in the neighbouring Czech Republic was more modest at 6.6%, but property prices have still grown at 25.4% over the past year. However, the Czech economy is likely to slow over the next few years, and there are already signs of a downturn in the housing market.\n\nPrice growth in Russia has picked up speed over the past quarter and now stands at 26.5%, compared to 21.7% during the first quarter of the year. Growth was highest in the Republic of Khaksiya (88.2%), whereas prices fell by 8.2% in the Chechen Republic. Growth in St Petersburg (41.5%) and Moscow (18.2%) was also strong, driven, as elsewhere, by rising wages and the increasing importance of the country's natural resources.\n\nRising tourist and second home demand continues to push prices upwards in both Croatia (5.8%) and Cyprus (12.9%). There are signs that the latter market is beginning to plateau, but locations such as Limassol are still attracting buyers and seeing steep price rises.\n\nLatvia continues to report the highest house price falls in the Knight Frank Global House Price Index, with values now 24.1% lower than a year ago. However, along with Estonia (-16%), the rate of decline is beginning to moderate. Both countries are experiencing high inflation and mortgage rates combined with a slowing economy and pessimism over the outlook for property prices. Prices in nearby Lithuania are now showing negative growth of 9.9%, and its situation is rapidly becoming comparable to its neighbours.\n\nDenmark appears to be suffering most of all the Western European economies, with annual price falls now amounting to 9.6%, according to the Knight Frank Global House Price Index. The Danish market peaked in the third quarter of 2006, and the slowdown began earlier here than elsewhere. The root causes are a slowing economy and increasing problems with interest rates and mortgage finance – a crisis highlighted by the high-profile rescue of Roskilde Bank earlier this year in the wake of £1bn of losses from bad debt, concentrated in the housing sector. Two thirds of Danish Banks are on a ‘watch list' composed by the Danish Financial Oversight Institute. The downturn in Ireland, which also began earlier than most, is continuing with prices now 8.1% below last year's level. Prices in Norway are flat but there are signs that the economy is slowing and inflation is rising, which could leave the market vulnerable to price falls.\n\nThe slowdown in the United Kingdom market is continuing. Although prices at the end of Q2 were only 3.9% lower than at the same point in the previous year, sales volumes are at the lowest level seen since the 1990s, with mortgage finance still very difficult to obtain. The prospects for the UK economy over 2009 are not optimistic, and it is unlikely that prices will recover until 2010. However, employment remains high and there are few forced sellers.\n\nPrices in Germany show an annual fall of 2.5%, down from 4.4% at the same time last year, and the rate of price falls is declining on a quarterly basis. There is less demand for owner-occupied property in Germany than in many other European countries and there is no shortage of supply. The economy is also slowing. Industrial orders have fallen for six months in the row, the worst run since the early\n\n1990s. The German Chamber of Industry and Commerce has warned of up to 200,000 job losses in coming months.\n\nThe well-publicised problems in Spain have not yet fed into house price statistics, and the Knight Frank Global House Price index reports a rise of 2.4%. So far, price falls have been concentrated in the coastal resorts and among new developments in the larger cities, and the changing climate here has not yet influenced the figure listed in the index. Spain looks likely to fall into recession later this year, and house sales fell steeply during June. The number of sales dropped by 34.3% in May and 29.6% in June, suggesting that wider price falls could be imminent.\n\nAsia Pacific:\n\nPrices in Singapore fell by 2.0% during a quarter in which its economy shrank by 6.6%, bringing annual growth to 16.3%, down from 29.9% three months ago. Rising inflation will further reduce purchasing power, and could lead to further price falls. Hong Kong is now the most rapidly appreciating property market in the region, with annual growth amounting to 25.1%. Economic growth remains strong but is expected to ease over the next year.\n\nIn China, property prices rose by 1.1% during the quarter, meaning that annual growth in the country is now 9.2%, compared to 7.1% at the same point last year. The rate of increase has slowed slightly, which can be attributed to the government clamping down on mortgage lending, in an attempt to prevent overinvestment and excessive construction activity. Despite increasing concerns, export and GDP growth remains strong in the country. New house price growth remains high in north-western Urumqi (20.2%), southern Haikou (18.1%), eastern Ningbo (14.7%), Hangzhou (13.3%) and Beijing (14.3%).\n\nIndonesia is experiencing a cooling housing market, with prices rising by just 0.9% over the quarter. Annual house price inflation is now 4.4%. There are concerns that the market is oversupplied as a result of the construction boom of recent years.\n\nAustralia has experienced a downturn in house price growth over the past quarter, with values dropping by 0.8%. Annual growth has now dropped to 9.0%, from 13.8% during the first quarter of the year. The Reserve Bank of Australia has increased its target cash rate to 7.25%, the highest level since 1994 (reduced it to 7%, Tues, Sept 02, 2008 - Finfacts) . In combination with a general tightening of lending rates and criteria among domestic banks, this has dampened activity throughout the market. Rates should decrease towards the end of the year, but it will be some time before this has any effect. Prices in New Zealand are sliding slowly, having fallen by 2.2% during the quarter. House prices are high compared to income and the country is pessimistic about the prospects for further price growth.\n\nThe Americas:\n\nPrices continue to fall in the United States. Values fell by 3.3% during the second quarter of 2008, contributing to an annual decline of 16.8%, the second largest fall in the Knight Frank Global House Price Index. However, prices are still rising in some states, including Oklahoma (4.9%). States such as California and Florida have witnessed falls of more than 12%. There are signs of recovery in cities such as Denver, Boston, Charlotte and Dallas, although according to some measures prices fell by over a quarter over the last year in Las Vegas, Miami, Phoenix and Los Angeles. Continuing problems with accessing finance and the ongoing crisis in the ‘sub-prime' sector continue to haunt the market.\n\nAccording to the Knight Frank Global House Price Index, Canada saw prices grow by 1.8% during the second quarter of 2008. Prices are now 4.8% higher than a year ago. There are signs, however, that the market is beginning to weaken. Prices in Calgary and Edmonton dropped by 8% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile, sales have dropped by over 10% over the past year and the number of new listings has increased by over 11%.\n\nAfrica:\n\nAccording to the Knight Frank Global House Price Index, prices in South Africa rose by 3.8% over the past year, the lowest rate since the third quarter of 1999. In real terms, prices have been falling since the beginning of the year: growth during the past quarter was just 0.1%. Double-digit inflation has forced a 5 percentage point rise in the base rate, which has severely dented affordability. South African consumers are highly indebted and it seems likely that prices will fall slightly in the near future.",

  "latent_14267": "AnastisiaOver the past several months, the thrice-weekly Russian newspaper Novaya Gazeta has featured five photo stories about children in the war zone of eastern Ukraine. There are three more reports to come, said the series creator, Yan Shenkman, a journalist in Moscow and a contributor to Novaya Gazeta, in an email.\n\n“The idea of our project is quite simple – we take pictures of children affected by the conflict in Ukraine, and tell their stories. No analysis, no political showdown, only their stories. Monologues, for the most part,” Shenkman told Truthout.\n\n“The idea came from a friend, a writer and political activist Maxim Gromov. He had already worked on a similar project – ‘The Children of Prisoners,'” Shenkman added.\n\n“The aim of the project is to show that because of the conflict, the most vulnerable parts of the population suffer.”\n\n“The second participant in our project is well-known St. Petersburg photographer Vladimir Telegin. I offered the idea to the editor-in-chief of Novaya Gazeta, Dmitry Muratov. That’s how ‘The Children of War’ became a special project of the Novaya Gazeta. We have published five reports so far. There will be three more.”\n\n“After that,” Shenkman continued, “I created a Facebook group to post the articles, photos and notes which were not included in the published reports in Novaya Gazeta. Soon, the group began to receive photos and notes from people who are doing similar things as well as posts of volunteers who work with children. I block any attempts at hate speech or aggressive expression in the Facebook group.”\n\n“We made three trips for the project – to the Rostov region of Russia, where we visited the refugee camps; to Donetsk city and the surrounding area; and thirdly to Slavyansk, Melitopol and Kharkiv which also have refugee camps. Volunteers from both sides helped us a great lot. If not for them, the whole thing wouldn’t have worked.”\n\nShenkman explained: “The aim of the project is to show that because of the conflict, the most vulnerable parts of the population suffer. And people are suffering on both sides. Children and their parents often don’t even realize who and why is fighting and who is shooting at them.”\n\n“We were struck by the evident contrasts. In city centers of the war zones, there are cafes, shops, well-dressed people, expensive cars. But just half an hour’s drive away, there are frightened children and elderly people living often without electricity, without food or proper clothing,” he added.\n\n“I don’t believe that anyone behind this war would truly come to their senses while looking at these photos and reading the stories. But at least they won’t be able to say they were not aware.”\n\n“To help them is very simple, but for some reason, nobody or almost nobody seems to care. This is what we observed in all three trips: in the town of Shakhty [Rostov region of Russia], in Donetsk (which, additionally, had been severely bombed) and in Kharkiv. Everything is very much alike on both sides of the frontline.”\n\n“I don’t believe that anyone behind this war would truly come to their senses while looking at these photos and reading the stories. But at least they won’t be able to say they were not aware.”\n\n“In my opinion, at present, regardless of who started the war and who is to blame, both sides of the conflict have their arms in blood up to their elbows. In this war, there is no right side or wrong side. There are criminals and there are victims. We talk with victims and speak about them. It is useless to talk to the criminals.”\n\n“There is yet another reason why we are doing this. Russian society (I can’t talk about Ukrainian society, since I don’t live there) is in a deep moral decay. Whatever you are doing – politics, business, even art – everything is upside down and has a bad smell. Assistance to victims is one of the few good and right things to be doing now. I won’t comment about numerous other things that people are doing. The only moral act right now is to see that killing people is a bad thing, whoever commits it and for whatever aims. Meanwhile, helping people is clearly a good thing. We work to remind people about this moral rule.”\n\nMeet the Children of War-Torn Donbas\n\nHere is a selection of the photos and stories of children from the Novaya Gazeta “Children of War” series and the Facebook group of the same name. The stories have been translated from the original Russian by NewColdWar.org. Photos are reproduced with permission.\n\nAlonya* Alyona, 13 years old\n\nAlyona and her family lived in the village of Peski, close to a military factory. The site was among the first to be bombed. The family fled to the city of Donetsk, where they live in a shelter for displaced families.\n\n“Once after the bombing, I had a nightmare. I dreamed that my mother was drafted to the levy as a nurse and I was left alone. It’s very frightening without my mother. I can’t be without her.”\n\nWhen asked what she wants to do when she grows up, Alyona said, “In my childhood, I wanted to become a veterinarian. But now I’m afraid of blood, very afraid. With this war, I do not know who I can become at all.”\n\nAlyona was asked if her family thought of moving to Russia. “Yes, we did. We were going to leave, but then the ferocious shelling started and we decided to wait. We waited and waited, and ended up staying. Mom said, ‘Who needs us in that country? What would we do there?’ It’s true. Here, at least, I know some people.”\n\n* Nikita, 7 years old\n\nNikitaNikita’s 7th birthday party took place in the refugee shelter where he lives. He received a present that was put aside beforehand from a humanitarian aid package – a toy car. The party was a lot of fun. A group of Roma who are also hiding in this shelter sang songs for Nikita and danced a little. Three languages were spoken at this birthday party – Russian, Ukrainian and Romani.\n\n“Then we ate cake,” Nikita said. “It wasn’t a real cake, though – mum put jam over bread and said that this is a cake for the celebration.” And celebrate they did.\n\n* Anastasia, 11 years old\n\n“My girlfriend Sasha was killed; she was my best friend. They were traveling by car. A diversionary group came running out of bushes; they started shooting, and Sasha got shot in the head. She was covering her younger brother, who was 2 months old at that time.”\n\n“When they told me about it, I asked, ‘How could this happen?’ It happened, and that is it. Sasha was operated on; she fell into a coma, which lasted all night. She died at dawn.”\n\n“When they bombed us, there was no shelter around, only a basement, where I stayed for 24 hours. Mice and rats [were] everywhere; it was cold.”\n\n“Housing blocs in our neighborhood are four stories. All I could think of throughout this time was that they are going to hit the building and the whole thing will collapse on me. I was afraid to sleep. I didn’t want to be buried under the debris. But finally I got so exhausted that I fell asleep.”\n\n* Lisa, 8 years old\n\nLisaThe conversation takes place in a student residence of Donetsk University. “Here we are, sitting with you, while over there, they are bombing my grandma,” Lisa said.\n\n“Over there” is in Shakhtyorsk [a сity and district center on the territory of the Donetsk People’s Republic, population of approximately 50,000)]. Lisa spent all summer in basements, hiding from the bombs. Her house was destroyed in an airstrike. She doesn’t have a home anymore. Her only remaining family is her grandmother who bluntly refused to leave her apartment.\n\nLisa, do you have a dream? “Yes. I want this war to end.” What did you dream of before the war? “I dreamt that my mom bought me a tablet.” Did she buy it? “Yes, she did. Now I dream that they stop shooting, and everything will be OK.”\n\nDuring the siege of the town of Ilovaisk, the town of Mospino was caught between the militia forces of Donetsk and the Ukrainian National Guard. Mospino has undergone a bombardment so massive that even three months later, the town is unable to recover. School 152 was lucky – it was untouched. Only the walls in some places are broken. You enter a classroom and it looks like the ceiling has dropped down.\n\n“We tried to teach a ‘lesson of peace’ to the schoolchildren there,” said the creators of the “Children of War” project. “What they have experienced are lessons of war, of hatred and fear, which hasn’t ended even now when the shelling has stopped.”\n\nAndrey, 15 years old\n\nAndrey had been away from the town for the whole summer. In early June, he passed his exams and then took up arms, joining the Donbass militia along with his father. He came back to classes in October when school reopened. It was not a romantic impulse to join the militia. It was a decision he took deliberately. Moreover, it was discussed at a family council. His mother and father thought about it and said it is better than him hanging out behind garages with vodka and cigarettes.\n\n“They didn’t assign me to military actions. We were at the front and we provided soldiers with their necessary equipment. During bombardments, we would jump out of the car, hide in trenches or ditches and then drive on. When it happened that there was no one to take over command of the training squadron, they appointed me because I performed well. Before the war, I never thought about what I would do. Now many are telling me that when I finish school I should go to Russia and train for a military profession.”\n\nDo you like to fight? Did you want to do this in life?\n\n“That’s not the point. I can manage it; that’s all. It wasn’t on purpose. I was watching TV and saw the May 2 events in Odessa. I decided, that’s wrong; I don’t want that to happen here; we have to resist.\n\n“Although . . . on the other hand, they are also trapped in this situation. They shoot us; we shoot them. What else can we do?”\n\nVladislav, 13 years old\n\n“I lost my father and grandfather. They drove into our yard and then two shells fell. A shock wave hit the car, killing both of them instantly. I know the date exactly: August 14, 5:30 pm.”\n\n“I don’t understand politics. I only know that just recently, we all went together to the sea, swam and rode on a boat. Now all this will never happen again. Ever.”",
  "latent_14328": "The day I have been dreading for a long time is almost here. This upcoming Saturday is 14 December, a year since that dark day when evil visited my town killing 20 children and 6 educators at the Sandy Hook School, that wonderful community school down the road from me.\n\nI feared that we would be hurled back to that awful period following 12/14 when the media overran the Connecticut town no one had heard of, a time when we could not sleep, we spent our days pretending to be strong for our children, and we quietly escaped into the bathroom to cry. But now that the \"day\" is so near, my trepidation has subsided. At the six-month \"anniversary\" Newtown Reverend Matt Crebbin ended the interfaith service he led by blaring Bob Marley through the Church's sound system: \"One Love! One Heart! Let's get together and feel all right.\" He was right. Newtown got America together and began building a partnership among communities from coast to coast, all united to reduce gun violence, and, it feels all right – or, at least, a little lighter.\n\nOn the cusp of the anniversary, I have HOPE, hope that because of this new coalition of Americans, \"change is gonna come\". Newtown is no longer just a place, but a movement.\n\nThat movement will be on full display this week as Americans from very different communities lock arms and honor the memories of the more than 30,000 victims of gun violence since 12/14 by performing acts of kindness. We will honor those lost with action.\n\nThe week of action kicks off at the New Britain, Connecticut YWCA today. Newtown's Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty, together with Connecticut Senator Richard Blumenthal, will be joined by members of the Newtown Action Alliance and Newtown Foundation to read to children. It is fitting that these leaders will be kicking off the week, as they along with Senator Chris Murphy, have been so supportive of Newtown, going well above the call of duty. In addition to speaking on behalf of the Newtown groups, I will be delivering these comments from another incredible leader, Newtown's First Selectman Patricia Llodra:\n\nIn Newtown, we believe that there is no greater gift of love than to perform acts of kindness in honor of those who lives were taken on December 14, 2012, in the Sandy Hook School shooting. We believe, too, that there is power sufficient to move the world – when so many think and act the same good thoughts and deeds. We cannot undo the awful happenings on that tragic day in Sandy Hook, nor can we turn back the clock against the many other senseless acts of violence that have hurt so many. But we can choose how we respond to those acts. In Newtown and Sandy Hook, we choose love. We invite you to join us in that choice in confidence that together we can make a better and safer world for all persons.\n\nJoining us in New Britain will be Tyrek Marquez, a young hero who has joined the Newtown movement. Five years ago, Tyrek, then just 7, was shot in the head at the West Indian Parade in Hartford. Today, he suffers from partial paralysis on the left side of his body, and has a limp and limited use his left arm. That did not stop Tyrek and his mother from riding the bus to Washington with the Newtown Action Alliance to join forces with families of gun violence from Chardon, Aurora, Hartford, Chicago, Tucson, and Virginia Tech and to talk to lawmakers about ways to reduce gun violence. Tyrek will be on the bus again from Newtown to Washington this Wednesday as we head back to the nation's capitol, this time to perform acts of kindness and for Thursday's National Vigil for Gun Violence Victims at the Washington National Cathedral.\n\nOther riders on the bus to Washington include Rev Henry Brown and Rev Sam Saylor from Hartford. The streets of Hartford are Rev Brown's church. Families of victims are his congregants. Last March, Rev Brown and his group, Mothers United Against Violence, held a march and rally. I was scheduled to speak immediately after Rev Saylor, whose son Shane, age 20, was gunned down last October. I welled up as I listened to this man:\n\nI'm sick and tired of Newtown. I'm sick and tired of hearing about Newtown. Newtown this, Newtown that, I don't want to hear about that. I want you to know about Shane, the beauty of Shane. … We were with Vice President Biden a month and a half ago, and he understood our rage because we are an appendage, a footnote in this discussion around the world. We matter! Violence did not happen in Newtown; it did not start in Newtown. It happened in the streets like Hartford and Bridgeport and New Haven. And I realized something, sitting next to a father from Newtown in Danbury when Vice President Biden came. When I was sitting next to him, he was crying. He cried like I cried. His tears were wet like my tears. They were full of pain like my tears were full of pain. He had rage like I raged. If he could have his child back, he would have his child back now. You can have Newtown. They didn't ask for this. And I'll be darned if I let publicity – over-publicity – about Newtown separate me from that father and his tears. I realized that I am Newtown. We are all Newtown.\n\nIt was my turn to take the podium, and it hit me. We are all Newtown and we are all Hartford. And Baltimore, Chicago, Detroit, Aurora, Tucson, Virginia Tech, and Columbine. We all stand united in our quest to end the parade of pain. We all seek peace. PEACE.\n\nThis Thursday, my new friend, Sam Saylor, will be offering a prayer of remembrance at the National Vigil. My old friend Matt Crebbin will be offering words of gratitude. Victims of gun violence from all over the country will be participating in litany groups. Carole King will sing \"In the Name of Love\". Sitting in the cathedral will be Tyrek and Newtown teens who are part of the Jr Newtown Action Alliance, led by Sarah Clements, whose mother, a teacher at the Sandy Hook School, saved children.\n\nTom Sullivan and Sandy Phillips, who lost their children at the theater in Aurora, and are dedicated to making our nation safer, are coming. So is Omar Samaha, whose sister Reema was killed during French class at Virginia Tech. Omar joined Team 26 on the last leg of our bicycle ride from Sandy Hook to Washington, and is now a full-fledged member of Team 26. Team 26's jerseys bear the words and symbols placed on it by Chris McDonnell for his daughter Grace: \"Peace, Hope, Love\". Shundra Robinson will also be in the cathedral. Her son, Deno, was murdered three years ago sitting on a porch in Chicago. She too was in Washington with the Newtown Action Alliance in September. When she spoke, there wasn't a dry eye in the room.\n\nThe cathedral will be filled with these heroes and other family members from these communities and others including Oak Creek and a group from Oakland, California. The Newtown Foundation put together a slideshow of their loved ones and the many others lost to gun violence at www.rally.org/vigil. The photos keep coming in, and the slideshow gets longer and longer.\n\nWhile we cannot bring back our 20 children and 6 educators in Newtown, or the more than 30,000 other victims of gun violence, and we certainly cannot fathom the pain of all of the families, we can honor them with action. Before the vigil, the broad coalition of Americans descending on Washington will be working in shelters and delivering Ben's Bells made the day before at a boy's school in Washington. We are asking you to perform an act of kindness in your community. These are days Newtown should be proud of. Newtown has opened its doors to the entire nation and has given a voice to those who did not have one. Newtown has shown the world that from the darkest depths, humanity can rise above, and good can prevail over evil. We are Newtown. We are all Newtown. We choose love. LOVE. Get on the \"bus\" and join the Newtown movement. Honor with action.",

  "latent_14392": "This article is about the storytelling style. For music produced from within a fictional world, see Diegetic music\n\nDiegesis (; from the Greek διήγησις from διηγεῖσθαι, \"to narrate\") is a style of fiction storytelling that presents an interior view of a world in which:\n\nDetails about the world itself and the experiences of its characters are revealed explicitly through narrative. The story is told or recounted, as opposed to shown or enacted.[1] There is a presumed detachment from the story of both the speaker and the audience.\n\nIn diegesis, the narrator tells the story. The narrator presents the actions (and sometimes thoughts) of the characters to the readers or audience. Diegetic elements are part of the fictional world (\"part of the story\"), as opposed to non-diegetic elements which are stylistic elements of how the narrator tells the story (\"part of the storytelling\").\n\nIn contrast to mimesis [ edit ]\n\nDiegesis (Greek διήγησις \"narration\") and mimesis (Greek μίμησις \"imitation\") have been contrasted since Plato's and Aristotle's times. Mimesis shows rather than tells, by means of action that is enacted. Diegesis is the telling of a story by a narrator. The narrator may speak as a particular character, or may be the invisible narrator, or even the all-knowing narrator who speaks from \"outside\" in the form of commenting on the action or the characters.\n\nIn Book III of his Republic (c. 373 BC), Plato examines the \"style\" of \"poetry\" (the term includes comedy, tragedy, epic and lyric poetry):[2] All types narrate events, he argues, but by differing means. He distinguishes between narration or report (diegesis) and imitation or representation (mimesis). Tragedy and comedy, he goes on to explain, are wholly imitative types; the dithyramb is wholly narrative; and their combination is found in epic poetry. When reporting or narrating, \"the poet is speaking in his own person; he never leads us to suppose that he is any one else\"; when imitating, the poet produces an \"assimilation of himself to another, either by the use of voice or gesture\".[3] In dramatic texts, the poet never speaks directly; in narrative texts, the poet speaks as him or herself.[4]\n\nIn his Poetics, the ancient Greek philosopher Aristotle argues that kinds of \"poetry\" (the term includes drama, flute music, and lyre music for Aristotle) may be differentiated in three ways: according to their medium, according to their objects, and according to their mode or \"manner\" (section I); \"For the medium being the same, and the objects the same, the poet may imitate by narration—in which case he can either take another personality as Homer does, or speak in his own person, unchanged—or he may present all his characters as living and moving before us\" (section III).\n\nDefinition [ edit ]\n\nIn filmmaking the term is used to name the story depicted on screen, as opposed to the story in real time that the screen narrative is about. Diegesis may concern elements, such as characters, events, and things within the main or primary narrative. However, the author may include elements that are not intended for the primary narrative, such as stories within stories. Characters and events may be referred to elsewhere or in historical contexts and are therefore outside the main story; thus, they are presented in an extradiegetic situation.\n\nIn literature [ edit ]\n\nFor narratologists all parts of narratives—characters, narrators, existents, actors—are characterized in terms of diegesis. For definitions of diegesis, one should consult Aristotle's Poetics; Gerard Genette's Narrative Discourse: An Essay in Method (Cornell University Press, 1980); or (for a readable introduction) H. Porter Abbott's The Cambridge Introduction to Narrative (Cambridge University Press 2002). In literature, discussions of diegesis tend to concern discourse/sjužet (in Russian Formalism) (vs. story/fabula).\n\nDiegesis is multi-levelled in narrative fiction. Genette distinguishes between three \"diegetic levels\". The extradiegetic level (the level of the narrative's telling) is, according to Prince, \"external to (not part of) any diegesis.\" One might think of this as what we commonly understand to be the narrator's level, the level at which exists a narrator who is not part of the story being told. The diegetic level or intradiegetic level is understood as the level of the characters, their thoughts and actions. The metadiegetic level or hypodiegetic level is that part of a diegesis that is embedded in another one and is often understood as a story within a story, as when a diegetic narrator himself/herself tells a story.\n\nIn film [ edit ]\n\nThe classical distinction between the diegetic mode and the mimetic mode relate to the difference between the epos (or epic poetry) and drama.[5] The \"epos\" relates stories by telling them through narration, while drama enacts stories through direct embodiment (showing). In terms of classical poetics, the cinema is an epic form that utilizes dramatic elements; this is determined by the technologies of the camera and editing. Even in a spatially and temporally continuous scene (mimicking the theatrical situation, as it were), the camera chooses where to look for us. In a similar way, editing causes us to jump from one place (and/or time) to another, whether it be elsewhere in the room, or across town. This jump is a form of narration; it is as if a narrator whispers to us: \"meanwhile, on the other side of the forest\". It is for this reason that the \"story-world\" in cinema is referred to as \"diegetic\"; elements that belong to the film's narrative world are diegetic elements. This is why, in the cinema, we may refer to the film's diegetic world.\n\n\"Diegetic\", in the cinema, typically refers to the internal world created by the story that the characters themselves experience and encounter: the narrative \"space\" that includes all the parts of the story, both those that are and those that are not actually shown on the screen (such as events that have led up to the present action; people who are being talked about; or events that are presumed to have happened elsewhere or at a different time).\n\nThus, elements of a film can be \"diegetic\" or \"non-diegetic\". These terms are most commonly used in reference to sound in a film, but can apply to other elements. For example, an insert shot that depicts something that is neither taking place in the world of the film, nor is seen, imagined, or thought by a character, is a non-diegetic insert. Titles, subtitles, and voice-over narration (with some exceptions) are also non-diegetic.\n\nIn video games [ edit ]\n\nIn video games \"diegesis\" comprises the narrative game world, its characters, objects and actions which can be classified as \"intra-diegetic\", by both being part of the narration and not breaking the fourth wall.[6] Status icons, menu bars and other UI which are not part of the game world itself can be considered as \"extra-diegetic\"; a game character does not know about them even though for the player they may present crucial information. A noted example of a diegetic interface in video games is that of the Dead Space series, in which the player-character is equipped with an advanced survival suit that projects holographic images to the character within the game's rendering engine that also serve as the game's user-interface to the player to show weapon selection, inventory management, and special actions that can be taken.[7]\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nBibliography [ edit ]\n\nAristotle. 1974. \"Poetics\".

  "latent_14432": "Ben Stansall / AFP / Getty Images The change to the Act of Succession will affect the children of Prince William and his wife Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge\n\nWhen it comes to change, the British monarchy is like an errant lover  it does the minimum required to keep its lady, fair Albion, from booting it out. And so, in an overdue nod to modernity, the rules of royal primogeniture have been altered to allow a first-born female to succeed the throne. This means if Kate and Wills (and any future monarchical couples) produce a daughter first, she will be Queen, no matter how many little brothers toddle along after her.\n\nThe leaders of Britain's band of ex-colonies, known as the Commonwealth, approved the change on Friday, along with an amendment to the Act of Succession that allows a future monarch to marry a Roman Catholic. Before now, falling for a Catholic meant giving up your right to the throne. (The amendment doesn't, however, allow the crown to be worn by a Catholic  Protestants only, please.) (See a brief history of Guy Fawkes.)\n\nThe decision upends over 300 years of constitutional tradition beginning with the 1688 Bill of Rights, which declared that it was dangerous to the \"welfaire of this protestant kingdome\" for a King or Queen to marry \"a papist.\" It may seem like a 17th century version of the red scare. However, against the background of the English civil war, the reign of the Catholic \"Bloody Mary,\" and the Gunpowder Plot  a failed attempt by Catholics to blow up the House of Lords and assassinate King James I in 1605  such rules may have once been more than just McCarthyism.\n\nBy contrast, boys inheriting the crown before girls was not a political decision. It's just the age-old Norman practice of male primogeniture, enshrined in English common law. Members of Parliament have tried to change the succession laws 11 times over the past few years  the latest being an attempt by Labour MP Keith Vaz, who tabled a bill in the House of Commons in January of 2011 that has yet to be passed. He noted that all six of England's Queens have been \"fantastic\" but that now it's \"all about the children of William and Kate Middleton. We have a biological deadline.\"\n\nThe changes (which still have to be ratified by Parliament) were announced at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Perth, Australia, where the Queen has been on tour, listening to didgeridoos and sampling kangaroo stew. Her Majesty doesn't have a hand in the decision, but court officials say she strongly supports the change. British Prime Minister David Cameron, meanwhile, heralded the new rule. \"The idea that a younger son should become monarch instead of an elder daughter simply because he is a man, or that a future monarch can marry someone of any faith except a Catholic  this way of thinking is at odds with the modern countries that we have become,\" he said at the meeting. (See a TIME video with David Cameron.)\n\nSome say the change feels like wiping your finger across the top of the corner cabinet  you don't realize how dusty it is until you've touched it. \"These are concessions so overdue that already they feel trivial,\" writes the left-leaning Guardian newspaper in an editorial, which nonetheless welcomed \"a zephyr of egalitarian zeal\" in court circles.\n\nOthers say the idea of an egalitarian monarchy is a contradiction in terms. \"It is crass to suggest that any tinkering with the monarchy is an issue of equality  it makes a laughing stock of Britain,\" said the campaign manager for antimonarchy group Republic, Graham Smith, in a statement Friday. \"The monarchy is founded on discrimination and elitism. It has no place in a debate over equality of opportunity.\"\n\nWhile the commentariat squabbles over the import  or irrelevance  of the change, historians say the move is part of a royal survival tactic that emerged during the reign of George V after the destruction of the European monarchies in 1917-18. King George (who delivered the first royal radio address in 1932) recognized that the British monarchy might not last unless it evolved, says historian Roger Lockyer, a retired professor of history at Royal Holloway, University of London. \"He turned the monarchy into a 'caring' monarchy, into a monarchy that patronized charities. And so the monarchy of remoteness has deliberately been replaced by a monarchy of access.\" The monarchy of access continued throughout the 20th century  from Queen Elizabeth II's first Christmas television broadcast in 1957 to the opening of Buckingham Palace to the public in 1993  and lives on today in Duchess Kate's $50 Zara frocks. (See pictures of Kate Middleton's sense of fashion.)\n\nWhile the monarchy modernizes, the English aristocracy has shown no signs of changing its laws of primogeniture that put young lords before ladies. Lockyer says it is typical of the royals to strike out in a different direction from the English peerage. \"One of the monarchy's weak sides in the modern world has been its links to the aristocracy  to the old world,\" he says. With Friday's decision, the royals continue to amend the traditions of title. It's what they must do, it seems, to keep their own.\n\nSee TIME's Royal Wedding special.",

The man inhales deeply and blows the smoke across the public footpath, and his buzz begins.\n\nThis is Grey St, Hamilton East, on the eve of Christmas 2013.\n\nThe sheer number of users coming and going from the shop is a result of the law that took synthetic cannabis out of dairies and put them into licensed premises where anyone over 18 years old can buy as much dope as they want.\n\nU njoY's interior resembles a white-washed prison cell.\n\nThe drugs are displayed behind security glass that falls to an inch above the counter.\n\nThe barrier is there, presumably, to keep the products, cash and staff safe if someone walks in with a weapon.\n\nThe door opens at 7am on weekdays and there is a sign in the window telling people not to mill about waiting on the pavement outside.\n\nOnce trade begins, there's a steady flow of business - $10, $20, $100.\n\nHomeless man Steven Henry has hundreds of dollars worth of \"Karma\" in his pockets.\n\nHe is easy to pick out among the people that now hang around Steele Park because he wears a white dress shirt, a tie, suit pants and shoes.\n\nAt 8.45am, he is standing still as a statue on the footpath in a stupor.\n\nOnce roused, he says he is 47 and on a benefit.

I'm a motivational smoker - I smoke and go and do a lot of work and tend to my children.\"\n\nAlcohol and tobacco are bigger problems for society than synthetic cannabis, he says.\n\nYet Henare admits it can be hazardous to people's health.\n\n\"Legalise cannabis in New Zealand so we don't have to have shops like these with chemicals in them that can hurt people.\"\n\nThe Waikato Times was unable to contact U njoY R18+ owner Kinnari Mihir Patel.\n\nThe legal high store is located at 371 Grey St and property title records show it is owned by two people.\n\nOne of the owners did not want to be named because his family were threatened when identified in a previous story.\n\nBut he told the Times he was only the joint landlord and derived no profit from the sale of legal highs.\n\nHe said his tenant, Mr Patel, was running a lawful business which had been subject to numerous random inspections by police.\n\nThe joint owner was aware of some public opposition to the Grey St puff shop when it first opened but thought matters had \"quietened down\".\n\nAsked if he had a responsibility to ensure the businesses operating from his premises were not negatively affecting the community, he would only say Mr Patel was running a \"lawful and ethical business\".\n\nThe joint owner was unaware of growing anti-social behaviour in Hamilton East and was not convinced such behaviour could be attributed to the Mr Patel's shop.\n\nThere would have to be \"very strong evidence\" before he was satisfied the surge in anti-social behaviour was linked to Mr Patel's business.\n\nAsked if there were any circumstances in which he would cancel the tenancy agreement, he declined to comment.\n\nHe said he would make his own inquiries before reaching any conclusion.\n\nWaikato Hospital emergency department clinical director John Bonning has criticised sythetic drugs in the past for clogging up his department.\n\nAt the worst end of the scale medical staff reported people having seizures and being in highly agitated, violent states.\n\nOther effects included persistent vomiting, visual and auditory hallucinations, and severe paranoia.\n\nMother of two Cassie Latemore, 27, would agree.\n\nShe was walking past U njoY with Krystal Weaver, 24, at 8.55am.\n\nMs Latemore said a friend of hers smoked Karma last Tuesday and had \"a full seizure\" that lasted about four minutes.

  "latent_14577": "NEWARK -- A Pennsylvania man who allegedly schemed with former officials at Caldwell University was charged Thursday with plotting to defraud a program that funded the education of veterans who served in the armed forces following the Sept. 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.\n\nAccording to a criminal complaint, the fraud involved tricking veterans into thinking they had enrolled in accredited university classes when they actually were taking courses developed and taught by an online correspondence school.\n\nDavid Alvey, of Harrisburg, Pa., appeared before U.S. Magistrate Judge Stephanie A. Gallagher in the Baltimore Division of the Maryland District Court Thursday afternoon, according to the office of U.S. Attorney Paul J. Fishman.\n\nAlvey, 49, is charged with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud, Fishman's office said.\n\nAlvey is the first individual to be charged in the alleged scheme, Fishman's office said, adding that the investigation is ongoing.\n\nCaldwell is the unnamed university referenced in the criminal complaint, said its attorney, Henry E. Klingeman.\n\nThe university, he said, has been cooperating in the investigation.\n\n\"Caldwell University was made aware today of the charges against ED4MIL's former President and owner,\" he said in a statement. \"More than five years ago, Caldwell began a contractual relationship with ED4MIL, a relationship Caldwell ended in 2013. Neither Caldwell University nor its current administration or staff is accused of wrongdoing.\"\n\nHe said the university would not issue any further statement \"out of respect for the ongoing criminal process.\"\n\nAccording to the criminal complaint, this is how the alleged scheme worked:\n\nAlvey is the founder and president of ED4MIL, a Lewisberry, Pa. for-profit firm that marketed and sold educational materials to members of the military.\n\nFeds use fake college in visa fraud sting\n\nAlvey, the complaint said, pitched the idea to university employees, who are identified as unnamed co-conspirators in the complaint, to partner with the university as a money-making plan for the school beginning in 2007.\n\nIn 2009, Alvey proposed to the co-conspirators an online non-credit \"GI Bill Program\" that would be offered through the university, but taught and administered by the correspondence school and other private entities contracted by Alvey, the complaint said.\n\nThe cost of the courses would be paid through the Post 9/11 GI Bill.\n\nAn unnamed co-conspirator, identified as an associate dean no longer with the university, worked with Alvey to sell the plan to the school. That person, the complaint says, left the university to work for ED4MIL.\n\nA second university employee, also identified as a co-conspirator, signed off on the program, knowing that Caldwell would not be providing the education, the complaint says.\n\nDuring the application to participate in the tuition benefit program, administered by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Alvey and co-conspirators did not disclose the involvement of ED4MIL or the correspondence school to the VA.\n\nOn Feb. 4, 2011, the university submitted an application falsely stating that the classes were primarily taught by university faculty who teach on campus, and that courses \"are the same as those courses offered on campus with the same learning outcomes,\" the complaint says.\n\nThe application was approved Feb. 24, 2011, it said.\n\nSalesmen then went to military bases throughout the U.S. and pitched the classes, wearing t-shirts and handing out pens emblazoned with the university's name.\n\nThose who enrolled had their information sent to a third alleged university co-conspirator who nominally enrolled the veterans in the university, but simultaneously enrolled them in the correspondence school, the complaint said.\n\nThe complaint says the university charged the VA prices that were 10 to 30 times higher than equivalent correspondence courses. It says, for example, that most of the correspondence school's classes cost between $600-$1,000, but the university billed for courses costing $5,000 to $26,000 per course.\n\nBy December, 2011, veterans were complaining, with one individual complaining that the VA was being charged $8,000 for a course that normally cost $749, the complaint said.\n\nFrom 2011 through August 2013, the VA paid out about $35 million in tuition and other benefits for thousands of veterans, it said.\n\nIt did not specify how or if the university made any money in the alleged scheme.\n\n\"The allegations of fraud committed by David Alvey are extremely serious because not only did his scheme potentially harm the Department of Veterans Affairs, it also victimized our nation's deserving veterans and their families,\" said Jeffrey G. Hughes, special agent in charge of the VA's Office of Inspector General's Northeast Field Office.\n\nThe wire fraud conspiracy count carries a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison and a fine, Fishman's office said.\n\nFishman credited special agents of the VA's Northeast field office, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Education, Office of Inspector General, with the investigation leading to the arrest.\n\nTim Darragh may be reached at tdarragh@njadvancemedia.com .

  "latent_14609": "On December 15, 2005, Major League Soccer and AEG (Anschutz Entertainment Group) announced that the San Jose Earthquakes would be moving to Houston for the 2006 season. The club was unable to find a permanent stadium solution in California and Oliver Luck, at the time a member of the Houston Sports Authority, led the charge to lure the franchise to Texas.\n\nThat would ultimately mean moving a highly successful team coming off a 2005 Supporters' Shield victory (and two previous MLS Cups), leaving their accomplishments behind, and starting fresh in an unproven and uncertain market. That team, the Houston Dynamo, would go on to record its own achievements and results that rivaled any other expansion team in MLS history.\n\nTen years later, the Dynamo are equipped with their own stadium, training facilities, multiple MLS Cup Final appearances, and a long, exciting tale to tell. As the historic tenth season gets underway,this is the oral history of the Houston Dynamo franchise, from it's checkered past in San Jose to the new \"3.0 era\" it currently embarks on. This is a story told by many of those who experienced it and still live it today.\n\nEddie Robinson, Defender (2006-2011): \"When I got drafted [in 2001], the roster size was 18. I remember going into San Jose and that's when [head coach Frank Yallop] and Dom did a complete re-tool of the team. We went through preseason and about halfway through, I start showing up in the locker room in the morning and I see guys cleaning out their locker. Guys that I think are better players than me, that I think have more experience than me... Slowly but surely, the season approached and they gave me a contract for $24,000. Which, in San Jose, California, was really a joke but screw that. I'm not going to turn that down. Are you kidding me?\"\n\nPat Onstad, Goalkeeper (2006-2010): \"Frankie [Yallop] and I had a history. We played together with the national team for years and we actually roomed together... I was pretty lucky because in '03 when they were trying to bring me to San Jose, [A-League team Rochester Rhinos] had nixed the deal and wanted a significant transfer fee. And it didn't look like it was going to happen and, of all things, the goalkeeper got hurt in San Jose and that changed everything. They paid the transfer fee and then off I went.\"\n\nRicardo Clark, Midfielder (2006-2009, 2012-current): \"For starters, [2005] was my first year in San Jose. I had just gotten traded to there from New York. It was new beginnings for me, moving from East to the West coast and just being a part of a new team. It was a lot of excitement that year for me.\"\n\n\"That's the best team I've ever played for and I would put that team up against any in the history of Major League Soccer.\" - Eddie Robinson\n\nWade Barrett, Defender (2006-2009): \"[2005] was one of the most rewarding seasons that I had in MLS... The team that was assembled that year was just very good from the first roster spot all the way through the last. It was very typical of the kind of teams that Dom put together that were very hard-working. They work for each other and it was a good team that got on a really good run and got into the habit of winning.\"\n\nBrian Ching, Forward (2006-2013): \"Seeing what that team accomplished and being a part of it was pretty special. We had a good group of guys. I think we just worked hard as a team. Defensively, we made it difficult for other teams to play.\"\n\nClark: \"I think [the 2005 Earthquakes] was probably one of the best group of guys that I'd played with in a long time. I think we had a really good understanding of each other on the field and there was a lot of chemistry that year from the coaching staff all the way down to the players... We clicked on the field. It was really something special. A special team to be a part of.\"\n\nRobinson: \"It was a team that, yes, our owner owns LA Galaxy. They have this really nice place down in LA and we have this double-wide. We literally had two double-wide trailers backed up against each other that had eight showerheads - two of them weren't hot. We just felt like we were the red-headed step-children and we played with a chip on our shoulder.\"\n\nRumors\n\nChing: \"When I got to the team in 2003, the guys had been talking about moving even before I got there. The three years that I was there, you kinda always heard a rumor here and there about the team moving. At that point, I think the rumor kind of loses its luster.\"\n\nBarrett: \"Dom did a great job of just keeping [move rumors] completely separate. It wasn't anything we thought about. That was something Dominic instilled in us was not thinking about anything except that particular day. We thought about that day in training, then we thought about the next day, then we focused on the game on the weekend and we didn't really look too far ahead.\"\n\nOnstad: \"I think San Antonio seemed to be the frontrunner if I remember correctly and then I believe there was an election there that changed everything... Then in the '05 season, there was rumblings but not until about midway through and, at that stage, you a had a terrible start to the season... and we were just focused on what we were doing.\"\n\nClark: \"I remember there was a lot of debate. We knew it was potentially going to happen. One week you'd hear the move was gonna happen then you hear it wasn't going to happen.\"\n\nOliver Luck, President (2006-2010): \"[As a member of Houston Sports Authority], we were discussing stadium issues, rodeo, football. Soccer came up. There was no MLS team but it came up in the context of, 'Should we be developing venues for soccer? Can soccer play in a football stadium?' Soccer came up but it wasn't a driving force... [Houston Texans owner] Bob McNair had expressed a real strong interest in a potential franchise out at what was called Reliant Park. Actually, if I remember correctly, in some of the original documents, McNair had an option to buy an MLS team to play out at Reliant Park.\n\nWe put a little group together that started to talk to the league, to look at a couple of the franchises in the league that were struggling... I think Kansas City was having a difficult time, Columbus were struggling a little bit, San Jose was obviously struggling.\n\nEventually, it sort of pointed towards San Jose and I remember going out there and visiting with Alexi Lalas, the president and GM of the club up there. They were really struggling with their relationship with San Jose State University and Spartan Stadium.\"\n\nI remember saying to Don Garber, 'San Jose is a great marketplace, a phenomenal town, a really cool place in the Bay Area but Don, you're never going to get them a building. You know that. Everybody knows that.' - Oliver Luck\n\nOnstad: \"We had a pretty good idea when the season ended but then it kind of went quiet. I remember after the season and going with my family to Hawaii and having a vacation. When I came back, I think it was actually the day I arrived back at the house, there was a voicemail and I called Dominic Kinnear and the next day we went down to the office.\"\n\nRobinson: \"We had a meeting. I think we had a meeting in our double-wide or double-double-wide. The quad-wide.\"\n\nChing: \"I remember we got a call in the middle of December that year saying that the team was moving... which was, I would say, kind of a shock to all of us because you hear all these rumors for so long, you don't put any stock into it. Then, all of a sudden, you're up and moving.\"\n\nClark: \"I was kinda excited for the move just to be somewhere different. Obviously, it was a little bit stressful especially with guys with families at the time. That was an obstacle we had to overcome.\"\n\nRobinson: \"I wasn't upset. At that point in my career, I had gotten to the point where I was old enough and wise enough to have a little bit of perspective... to know that, 'Okay, that's fine we're moving but I'm still going to get to do what I love doing. I'm still going to get to play soccer for a living. Who am I to complain about where it's done?\"\n\nBarrett: \"For us, it was an exciting time. Also a little bit of an uncertain time. There was just a little bit of uncertainty about how that was going to go and what it was going to be like when we made the move. You didn't have a whole lot of time to be nervous about it. You had to get very focused very quickly on just the logistics of how you were going to move your family.\"\n\nTransition\n\nOnstad: \"Myself, Wade Barrett, and Dominic hopped on a plane and flew to Houston for a press conference [the next day]. It was pretty surreal, too. I've never been on a private jet like that but Mr. Anschutz flew us all out on a private jet, which was pretty impressive, and then we were introduced to what was a pretty fantastic group of people as we certainly found out later in Houston. It was a pretty nice welcoming and certainly a sign of things to come.\"\n\nLuck: \"The announcement was made. I was the first employee of the Dynamo. We had a game to play in two and a half, three months, which is absurd when you think about it. We had no name, no colors, working on a stadium lease so the players can practice, they haven't found a place to live, haven't sold one ticket, didn't have a sponsor. You had to do all that stuff in a very short time period.\"\n\nChing: \"I had to be in LA the beginning of January [for USMNT camp]... I had one day to look around while I was [in Houston] and then found a place in the Galleria that day. Turned around and ended up buying it. I saw the place, put an offer in, and ended up buying a house in a day and not knowing much about the city of Houston at all.\"\n\nBarrett: \"The one thing that was a little different in this move typical from other MLS moves - because everybody in the league understands that you might have to move during your career - but there was no support structure in place in Houston. It wasn't as if there was a full team there that had been there for awhile and you were just one person moving into that new environment.\"\n\nRobinson: \"When we left San Jose and we were told by Major League Soccer that 'all of your accomplishments - the two MLS Cups, the Supporters Shield, the Conference Championships - you don't get to take those with you. They're going to stay here.' I was offended. I'm still offended to this day. Completely and utterly disgusted that there was eventually going to come another group of guys that got to wear those stars, who got to have a history they didn't earn... It really pissed me off. It really upset me. There wasn't a lot of respect.\"\n\nOnstad: \"Fortunate thing for us is that Mr. Anschutz did a great job of looking after the guys out there. He wasn't obligated to do that in the CBA we had at the time. He stuck his neck out for the guys. He knew he was putting the guys in a bad spot that no one had before.\"\n\nRobinson: \"At the time, I think that Major League Soccer only was responsible for about $5,000 in relocation fees. AEG took every single cent of it. Players that had homes and guys that had 10, 15, 20,000 dollars in relocation fees - AEG paid every single cent and I put that on Phil Anschutz... I have more respect for him than pretty much anyone that I've come in contact with that had anything to do with Major League Soccer.\"\n\nBarrett: \"The one thing that it did was it brought our group of players and the families closer together. Just the shared experience of going through that together... I think really helped the team in our first year. It brought us all together a little bit, probably a little bit closer than what we had been.\"\n\nUnveiling\n\nChris Canetti, President (2010-current): \"For the Dynamo or any MLS team, I think you want a year and a half, two years of runway to build up to your grand opening.\"\n\nLuck: \"[Houston 1836] was one of maybe four or five names that we looked at and MLS looked at. We didn't really have time to focus group... Once we announced that name, it became pretty clear pretty quickly it wasn't acceptable within the Mexican-American community... We quickly realized, 'This isn't going away... It's definitely going to get worse. A lousy way to launch ourselves. We should change it. If we have to apologize, we apologize, we make some statement.' We did it very quickly.\n\nIt was a very good cultural experience and it did teach us a number of things. One of which was, as Anglos, we often just say, 'There's the Latino community. The Latino community speaks with one voice.' But it really doesn't. The Latino community is as diverse as the Asian community or the European community. There was some really good lessons for all of us in there.\"\n\nRobinson: \"The first appearance I ever did was at a small indoor soccer complex. There were maybe thirty people there. Somebody brought some Chik-fil-a chicken nugget trays. We signed autographs and took pictures and it was still probably just as much or more than anything we ever done in San Jose. Again, we weren't very popular in San Jose. Nobody cared that we were in San Jose until we were leaving San Jose and it was too little, too late.\"\n\nChing: \"To be honest, I didn't know what to expect. I didn't really get a feel for what anything was going to be like until, really, that first game.\"\n\nOnstad: \"We knew we had a good team. The year before, we had won the Supporters Shield. We really hadn't made any changes. If anything, we felt a year stronger and a little bit more hungry because we had blown it in the playoffs the year before. We didn't want to have that feeling again. We knew coming into Houston in '06, we had a great shot of winning the thing.\"\n\nClark: \"I remember the first game was awesome. There was a lot of energy, a good crowd. All of us didn't really know what to expect coming in and I remember we had a great game that day.\"\n\nChing: \"I heard stories of Phil Anschutz out collecting tickets to get people in because we weren't prepared for the amount of people.\"\n\nOnstad: \"I think we knew there was a pretty big buzz in the city but... you knew as we walked down the tunnel that there was something special right off the bat. For us, it gave us a little extra lift and Brian scoring [four goals] and then the goal of the game was Alejandro Moreno's bicycle kick. There was some great moments in that game and I think everyone had played a part in that game. I think everybody either made a big tackle or a big pass or got an assist or a goal.\"\n\nChing: \"For that kind of statement to be made right from the beginning, it really went a long way and that, I guess endeared us to Houston and the fans and kickstarted a great relationship.\"\n\nRobinson: \"People can say what they want about the Galaxy teams but you put this current LA Galaxy team - even with Robbie Keane, Landon Donovan, and Omar Gonzalez - against our '03 - '06 teams, we would've done to them like we did to everyone else. We would've bashed them in their mouths and we would've scored goals along the way.\"\n\nIn the next part, we'll retrace the steps of the back-to-back MLS Cup Champions through their first two seasons.\n\nPart 2, Part 3, Part 4\n\n(Photo Credits: Jonathan Daniel/Getty Images; Harry How/Getty Images; Victor Decolongon/Getty Images)",
  "latent_14628": "The house rebuilding project is going well. We’ve finished all the framing, and the higher ceilings and more open floorplan are hinting at a level of awesomeness that surprises even me. A picture from just this morning:\n\nWhile I’ve destroyed and rebuilt quite a few houses for other people, this is the first one I have been fortunate enough to create from nearly scratch for my own family, so I am treating it as a bit of a science experiment. I want to build neat energy-saving features into it, but they need to be cost-effective and homegrown whenever possible.\n\nAny old rich guy can hire the top architect and boutique builder to make him the latest LEED-Platinum superhouse to show off in Dwell magazine… at $1000 per square foot. But with energy cheap and skilled labor and high-end home materials expensive, it takes more thought and experimentation to save energy AND money at the same time. And one of these experimental projects is to build my own radiant under-floor heating system.\n\nIf you have never heard about this, you’ll want to tune in. The dominant heating method in the US right now is the forced air furnace – a big box in your basement that blows air (and dust) through a huge network of bulky air tubes so it can reach all parts of your house through floor vents. It works, but it is not elegant: they make noise, waste a surprising amount of interior space with ducts and chases, and are a hassle to install or upgrade.\n\nWhen my small construction company was building some houses from the ground up a few years ago, the architect highly recommended that we use hydronic (radiant) heat instead of forced air. “It is a world of difference”, he said, “To have that silent warmth radiating at you through the floor instead of just blowing around some hot air.”\n\nUnfortunately, when I got quotes from some plumbers for this type of heating system, the cost was astronomical: $35,000 or more, when a full conventional heating system was only $10,000 installed. Since these homes were being built to sell, on a tight budget to compete with other houses in the forced-air price range, I reluctantly decided to skip the luxury option. Plus, the passive solar design in our architecture would ensure that the furnace was used only lightly anyway.\n\nNow, the picture has changed. I have learned to do my own plumbing, and new technologies have come down in price that make radiant heat much more affordable. After quite a few long nights of research and online training videos, I have bought all the necessary parts and we are about to put this sucker in.\n\nWhat is Hydronic Radiant Heating?\n\nHave you ever walked past a large brick building long after the sun goes down, and felt warmth all over your body even without touching the wall? How about feeling the heat from a hot bed of campfire coals even when sitting some distance away? This is radiant heat in action: a warm surface shines out infrared light (also known as heat), which directly warms your skin. With a hot campfire on a still mountain night, you can feel completely warm even when the air temperature around you is below freezing.\n\nThis same concept applies nicely to warming a house with hydronic radiant heat: warm water circulates in tubes under your floor, causing the floor to warm up and shine heat at you from all directions. There are no ducts and no blowing dust, and the system operates silently. And because the system is warming your skin directly at the same time it warms the air of your house, you feel warmer at a lower temperature setting, which allows you to keep the house cooler, saving energy. But the best part may be that you have constantly warm feet, wherever you go in your house.\n\nSo how do we build one of these systems? In a nutshell, you need something to heat the water (sometimes called a boiler), a network of tubing under your floor, and a pump to circulate that water through all that tubing:\n\nWhile the concept is simple, my summary leaves out a lot of detail. When you look at the typical “boiler room” in a luxury house, there are all sorts of valves and sensors, and miles of meticulously soldered copper from the $35,000 plumber. I mean, shit, does this look like an easy do-it-yourself project to you?\n\nOn top of that, hydronic heating is an art and science unto itself, with things like ΔT, GPM, BTU/hr, and R-value calculations involved. If you can get through all that, you’re faced with boilers that start at $2000, a complicated selection of parts that nobody except the experts really understands (you won’t be getting advice at Home Depot on building one of these systems), and all sorts of other hurdles.\n\nHowever, after digging through all this rubble, I found a few simplifications that bring the cost and complexity of radiant heat way down, to make it a DIY-compatible project for the average handy Mustachian. The tricks I’m applying for my system:\n\nUsing drinking-water-safe components allows an “open loop” system which requires fewer valves and allows item 2: Using a single tankless water heater for both hot water and house heating cuts out the $2000-$4000 boiler cost. I chose this extremely efficient Rheem Tankless unit that runs only about $1200. A single variable speed circulator pump eliminates most of the loss and loop size calculations by sensing the water temperature and adjusting its speed automatically (this also saves energy). Using a pre-made manifold from Rifeng allows easy multi-zone control and adjustment, without the need to ever mess with the tubing after you install it. And of course, everything is done in PEX, to eliminate the cost, slow installation, and boiler-room heat loss of copper pipes.\n\nDisclaimer: Like all of my experiments, and indeed my whole lifestyle, there is some unproven stuff in here. I am using myself as a guinea pig, and there may be some trial and error, and even risk involved. Enjoy and learn, but don’t dive in as a beginner just to follow me (another beginner) blindly!\n\nBoiling it all down, the system I ended up with is relatively simple, and I drew it out for you in this picture:\n\nSo far, this is a work in progress. I have already run this by a system designer and received his nod of approval, and completed some of the installation, so I am sure we can get this to work. But there are surely improvements to be made.\n\nThe great thing about this blog is that there are many people reading right now (including professional plumbers) who have already done this, so if you have any suggestions on how to improve or simplify it further, it would be much appreciated and I will update the article as new information is received. I will also publish a second post when everything is done, to show a few of the steps in progress and the finished pictures.\n\nReader corrections so far:\n\nAdd the expansion tank before the pump, not after it as currently shown\n\nWatch out for Legionella bacteria growth in an open-loop system like this. While rare , the bacteria is dangerous. Exactly the same risk exists if you have a tank-type water heater and keep the water under about 120F. Solution: make sure my tankless unit is hot (legionella dies above 122F, so perhaps 130 or higher), to exterminate bacteria. Also, drain or flush the heating loops during the offseason so the water does not sit stagnant for months.\n\n, the bacteria is dangerous. Exactly the same risk exists if you have a tank-type water heater and keep the water under about 120F. Solution: make sure my tankless unit is hot (legionella dies above 122F, so perhaps 130 or higher), to exterminate bacteria. Also, drain or flush the heating loops during the offseason so the water does not sit stagnant for months. OR, create two-loop system with a heat exchanger in between the two loops, so the heating water never touches the hot tap water. This requires oxygen-barrier PEX and an air eliminator. You can also buy tankless heaters with two independent loops: one for heating, one for potable water.\n\nAdd a check valve on the 3/4″ return line so cold water cannot sneak back into the manifold instead of going to the Rheem (I guess this could happen when the pump is off)\n\nActually, add a check valve on every loop, just to make sure there are no flow surprises and water goes the direction you want it to. Otherwise, cold water can be drawn through loops unexpectedly.\n\nMany tankless heaters (including the Rheem I recommend above) are not warrantied for use in heating systems. This is fine for me, as I find warranties are generally useless anyway. But it is good to note.\n\nFurther criticism about this experiment showed up here on the forum of the useful site called heatinghelp.com. While the thread almost convinced me that I am an idiot, the thing is that a similar discussion forms somewhere on the internet about every single article that ever appears on this blog. Many plumbers spend their days cursing this site just because I recommend doing some of your own plumbing with PEX, for example. The problem is that my fellow tradesmen tend to use anecdotes rather than statistics to make these safety decisions. The experiment will go on undeterred, but I will make a point of doing some tests with my friend who works at the city’s drinking water treatment/analysis lab.\n\nWhat About Cooling?\n\nEvery house should be designed to suit its own climate. Here in Colorado, we have intense sun nearly every day but much cooler nights due to our elevation 5000 feet above sea level. So the house has loads of South-facing windows to capture heat and more loads of thermal mass to smooth out day and night temperature swings.\n\nIn the summer, this picture flips around: the Earth tilts so the sun is nearly overhead (and the large overhangs I built onto the house shade the windows from the rest of it). You keep the windows closed during the 90F days and the interior stays cool. On summer nights, the temperatures drop below 60F, so you run a large fan blowing out the day’s heat to cool everything down and begin the cycle anew.\n\nI find this strategy (along with not being a Giant A/C Wussy) allows us to live happily without turning on our A/C in Colorado. But there’s always a backup: most modern houses without ducts use a ductless mini-split air conditioning system for cooling. These can be more efficient than central A/C systems, because you only cool the rooms where heat is building up. I will add a system like this if necessary, but we will be sure to test out a summer without air conditioning first, since the place is likely to be even more comfortable than our current house, even without cooling.\n\nAs the final cheat sheet, here is my shopping cart from PexSupply, my preferred supplier of plumbing stuff. There are a few extra things in my shopping cart for building out the bathrooms, but in general this is a complete system for a 1500 square foot house: about $1100, with free shipping and no sales tax. Add in the water heater and you have a complete heat and hot water system that costs less than a single low-efficiency furnace.\n\nAn efficiency upgrade to this system: I also purchased two boxes of aluminum heat reflector plates from Amazon which should improve heat transfer and efficiency slightly. Cost was $2.45 per 4-foot plate ($245 for each box of 100).\n\nUpdate: After building the system with these, I feel it was highly worthwhile as it makes installation faster and cleaner, and improving heat transfer is a worthwhile goal with wood floors – while they work well, you do need all the heat you can get.\n\nUpdate: One Year Later\n\nThis system is now up and running and you can read the results in the update article here:\n\nThe Radiant Heat Experiment – Did it Work?",

She had the dangerous task of supplying fuel and ammunition to ships in and near, combat areas in both the Atlantic Ocean and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nSS Esso Columbia II was built at Chester, Pennsylvania, by the Sun Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Co. for the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey; launched on 7 September 1942; sponsored by Mrs. Harold G. McAvenia; renamed by the Navy Atascosa and designated AO-66 on 16 September 1942; purchased by the Navy on 12 October 1942: and commissioned on 9 November 1942, Lt. Comdr. Melvin H. Bassett in command.\n\nWorld War II North Atlantic operations [ edit ]\n\nFollowing her commissioning at Baltimore, Maryland, the oiler sailed to Hampton Roads, Virginia, where she arrived on 19 November. At the conclusion of a month of trials, she got underway on 19 December for Port Arthur, Texas, where she took on a cargo of fuel oil and gasoline and then returned to Norfolk, Virginia, on 3 January 1943.\n\nAfter a two-day respite, Atascosa left the U.S. East Coast, bound for Bermuda. She spent one week there before sailing back into Norfolk on 16 January. Atascosa made another run to Port Arthur for more oil and discharged that cargo at Norfolk before entering a drydock at the Norfolk Navy Yard for a brief period of repairs. When the oiler was refloated, she began preparations for a deployment to the Pacific.\n\nTransfer to the Pacific Fleet [ edit ]\n\nAtascosa left Norfolk on 19 March and, after stops at Galveston, Texas, and Baytown, Texas, transited the Panama Canal on 4 April. Her ultimate destination was Noumea, New Caledonia, which she reached on 28 April. The oiler discharged her cargo and then loaded more fuel oil and aviation gasoline to be taken to Samoa. She arrived at Pago Pago on 4 May, but left the next day, bound for the United States, and reached San Pedro, California, on 28 May. There, she took on a cargo of petroleum and aircraft for transportation to Suva, Fiji Islands, and Nouméa, New Caledonia. More shuttling between the U.S. West Coast and these ports and the west coast occupied June, July, and August. In early September, Atascosa left Noumea and set course for Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. She arrived there on 9 September and began her duties fueling various ships of the fleet. In October, the oiler added Tulagi and Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands to her fueling stops. She broke this routine somewhat by a trip to Nandi Bay in the Fiji Islands, where she arrived on Christmas Eve 1943. After delivering fuel and supplies, she again got underway on 11 January 1944 to return to Espiritu Santo.\n\nSearching for survivors in the water [ edit ]\n\nAtascosa put to sea on 15 February to rendezvous with Rear Admiral Merrill's Task Force (TF) 39. She fueled three cruisers and four destroyers at sea before returning to Purvis Bay. A second fueling rendezvous with TF 39 took place on 6 March. The oiler stopped briefly at Purvis Bay, then went to Espiritu Santo on 15 March to begin preparations to rendezvous with a part of TF 58. The meeting occurred at sea on 26 March. Shortly after midnight on the morning of 28 March, Atascosa was informed that a Liberator bomber had gone down in the vicinity of the fueling group, and she began a search for its crew. Observers on the oiler spotted a life raft, but it proved to be unoccupied, and Atascosa soon terminated her rescue efforts.\n\nApproached by a Japanese aircraft [ edit ]\n\nOn 29 March, she was servicing units of Destroyer Divisions 93 and 94 when a Japanese plane closed the group. After Atascosa fired two rounds at the intruder, the plane quickly departed. The rest of her mission passed without incident, and Atascosa retired to Espiritu Santo on 5 April.\n\nStateside overhaul [ edit ]\n\nOn 21 May, Atascosa left New Caledonia, bound for the west coast. She arrived at Terminal Island, California, on 7 June to undergo a routine overhaul and repairs. The yard work was completed on 22 July, and the ship got underway to return to her wartime duties. She touched briefly at Pearl Harbor before finally arriving at Eniwetok on 11 August. There, she unloaded her deck cargo and serviced a number of destroyers. Standing out to sea on the 17th, the ship fueled battleships Iowa (BB-61), Indiana (BB-58), and Alabama (BB-60). At a rendezvous with the fast carrier task force between Rota and Guam on 4 September, Atascosa serviced several destroyers and aircraft carrier Enterprise (CV-6).\n\nFueling during adverse weather [ edit ]\n\nAir alerts interrupted the oiler's routine at Saipan between the 5th and the 9th, before she steamed to Guam. During September Atascosa fueled many units of task force TF 38. She made stops at Saipan and Eniwetok before arriving at Ulithi on 13 October. She got underway again on 21 October to rendezvous with TG 30.8 in an area east of Luzon. The oiler was fueling task force TF 38.3 in early November when she encountered high, seas and increasingly strong winds. During the operation, hose lines between ships were carried away several times. On 7 November, while fueling Langley (CVL-27), the steel manifold on the after port 6-inch connection was carried away, forcing the suspension of operations. Six members of Atascosa's crew were injured while making and tending gasoline connections. The weather abated on 9 November, allowing the oiler's crew to make temporary repairs so that fueling could be resumed. Atascosa put into port at Ulithi on 17 November. She sailed on 10 December to meet fast carrier forces off Cape Engaño and again encountered heavy seas. This soon developed into a typhoon; and, by 18 December, visibility was reduced to zero. The next day, the weather had improved enough to allow fueling to resume. Atascosa returned to Ulithi on 23 December for the Christmas holidays.\n\nFueling the fleet at Okinawa [ edit ]\n\nDuring January and February 1945, Atascosa supported the operations of TG 30.8 and made several meetings with TF 58. She dropped anchor at Ulithi on 3 March for repair work. The ships of TF 58 left Ulithi several days before Atascosa departed on 19 March to support their attacks on the Japanese homeland. Her next assignment was to fuel the ships of TG 50.8, which were anchored off Okinawa. Atascosa returned to Ulithi on 1 May to undergo repairs and to replenish supplies. In mid-June, Atascosa set her course for Okinawa, where she remained for a month. After a brief supply stop at Ulithi, the oiler put to sea on 8 August to rendezvous with TF 38 off southern Honshū. While engaged in this mission, she received word of Japan's capitulation.\n\nEnd-of-war activity [ edit ]\n\nAtascosa returned to Ulithi on 31 August. However, her service in the Pacific had not yet ended, as she left on 8 September to steam to Tokyo Bay. She remained in Japan until 24 September, then sailed to San Pedro, California. The oiler arrived back in the United States on 8 October.\n\nPost-war decommissioning [ edit ]\n\nAtascosa was decommissioned on 21 January 1946 at Mare Island, California; her name was struck from the Navy list on 7 February; and she was transferred to the Maritime Commission on 1 July 1946.\n\nSold to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey in 1947 and renamed SS Esso Syracuse, she transferred to Panamanian registry in 1950 but continued serving as SS Esso Syracuse until scrapped at Genoa 1960. 329-foot (100 m) forward part grafted to 274-foot (84 m) after part of SS Esso Buffalo which became bulk carrier SS Spitfire and was scrapped 1973.\n\nMilitary honors and awards [ edit ]\n\nAtascosa was authorized the following campaign medals:\n\nAmerican Campaign Medal\n\nAsiatic-Pacific Campaign Medal (1)\n\nWorld War II Victory Medal\n\nNavy Occupation Service Medal (with Asia clasp)\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nThis article incorporates text from the public domain Dictionary of American Naval Fighting Ships.",
  "latent_15003": "The Maple Leafs will have a lot of new faces around the rink this year. The Leafs have done an overhaul of their bottom six forwards and have also changed several defenders. All of the new players will be looking to make an impact this season in their own ways. The newly signed players who are hoping to make the team this season are: David Booth, Matt Frattin, Leo Komarov, Petri Kontiola, Roman Polak, Stephane Robidas, Mike Santorelli and Daniel Winnik. This is a summary of what each player brings to the table.\n\nFormer Vancouver Canucks teammates Mike Santorelli #32 and David Booth #7 may be used on the same line because of their experience playing together. (Getty Images – Andre Ringuette/NHLI via Getty Images\n\nDavid Booth: 29yrs/6’1″/212lbs\n\nLast season-Vancouver Canucks/66 gp/19 pts/+1\n\nBooth is a player trying to find his game. The one time 30 goal scorer has never been able to truly get his game back after Mike Richards gave him a severe concussion on a very questionable hit. At his best Booth used his speed and size to put himself into quality scoring positions but ever since the Richards hit he just seems to have lost a step. Booth played with Santorelli in Vancouver, the Leafs may try and use this to their advantage and use them on the same line. At 1.1 million dollars for one year, this is a low-risk signing for a player who could potentially find himself on the second line. Although, players who falter like Booth has rarely ever fully recover. Booth will be looking to be the exception so that he can drive up his asking price next summer and more importantly extend his career past next offseason.\n\nMatt Frattin: 26yrs/6’/205lb\n\nLast season- LA Kings, Columbus Blue Jackets/44 gp/7pts/-4\n\nLike Booth, Frattin will be looking to have a better season this year. After his first stint with the Leafs, Frattin played in LA and Columbus and was re-acquired this offseason. At 26, Frattin is still young enough to improve. He seems to have all of the tools to be a great player; a hard accurate shoot, great speed, he finishes his checks and also back checks hard. This year will be an important test for Frattin, will he finally be able to put it all together? The Leafs may be looking to use Frattin on the 3rd or 4th line to start the season, however if he plays well they may look to rekindle his chemistry with Kadri and place him on the 2nd line at some point during the season.\n\nLeo Komarov: 27yrs/ 5’10″/189lbs\n\nLast season- Moscow Dynamo (KHL)/52 gp/34 pts/+16\n\nKomarov is a Finnish player who plays a very “Canadian” style of hockey. Komarov finishes virtually every check, he also agitates his opponents and is good defensively. The Leafs may be looking to use him in a checking roll because his strengths could allow him to get the opposing teams top players off of their game. Komarov self-admittedly, will be looking to be better offensively this time around in Toronto to earn his new contract of 2.95 million per year for the next 4 years. He has shown in the KHL and AHL that he can be an offensive threat but success outside of the NHL does not always translate. The Leafs may utilize Komarov on a line with his countryman and friend Kontiola, who he has played with several times in the past.\n\nLeo Komarov finishes his check on Russia’s team captain Alex Ovechkin at the Sochi Olympics. (Getty Images – Bruce Bennett via Getty Images)\n\nPetri Kontiola: 29yrs/6’/197lb\n\nLast season- Chelyabinsk Traktor (KHL)/53 gp/37 pts/-11\n\nPossibly most famous for this interview (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HM5YUE4B7Xc) (“I don’t know” interview). Kontiola has shown that he can be successful both Internationally and in the KHL. He was originally drafted by Chicago and only played 12 games for them before leaving. Kontiola can play all of the forward positions, on the powerplay and the penalty kill as well. Although he is not an overly physical player like his countryman Komarov, he still is feisty. What he lacks in massive hits he makes up with his offense and could possibly have a decent season in that respect.\n\nRoman Polak: 28 yrs/6’1″/227lbs\n\nLast season- St. Louis Blues/72 gp/13 pts/+3\n\nPolak was a third pairing defenseman in St. Louis who was acquired at this years draft in a trade in exchange for Carl Gunnarsson. Polak put up solid and reliable defensive minutes for a team that is very good defensively. Polak is a defense first type of player who will not allow opposing players to take liberties with the goalies. If Toronto does not overuse Polak by giving him top pairing responsibilities, he has a good chance to be successful for the Leafs. The Leafs may pair him with Gardiner or Rielly so he can cover for their defensive lapses.\n\nStephane Robidas: 37 yrs/5’11″/190lbs\n\nLast season- Dallas Stars,Anaheim Ducks/38 gp/10 pts/+10\n\nRobidas is a veteran shutdown defender. Robidas is looking to remain healthy this season after broken legs on two separate occasions caused him to miss large portion of last season. One of those broken legs he has still not been medically cleared from, and so his health going in to this season is in question. If he is able to overcome the career threatening injuries from last season, he will look to return to the reliable tough-nosed defender that he has been throughout his career. The Leafs may look to use Robidas in the same role as Polak; a defensively responsible mentor for Rielly or Gardiner.\n\nMike Santorelli: 28yrs/6’/190lbs\n\nLast season- Vancouver Canucks/49 gp/28 pts/+9\n\nSantorelli is a player looking to build upon his success from last season. Again, he is a player who can play all of the different forward positions. The Leafs may choose to use him as a 3rd or 4th line center. Santorelli is a fast, creative player with a high hockey IQ. He may be poised to have a career year and at 1.5 million for one year he is another low-risk player who could yield high reward.\n\nDaniel Winnik: 29 yrs/6’2″/210lbs\n\nLast season- Anaheim Ducks/76 gp/30 pts/+6\n\nWinnik is yet another versatile forward. Winnik can play in almost any situation and at any forward position. In Anaheim he played on their pk and 3rd or 4th line and put up reliable, defensively responsible minutes. He does use his size to his advantage but don’t expect any bone crushing hits from him. His success will rely on his ability to kill penalties for the Leafs and his ability to check the top lines of other teams. Winnik is another low-risk, high-reward type player because of his 1.3 million dollar contract for one year.\n\nDaniel Winnik contemplates whether or not he left the stove on while sitting on the Anaheim bench last season. (Getty Images – Andy Devlin/NHLI via Getty Images)\n\nThe Leafs look to have learned from last year, where during a stretch their top 3 centers were injured and they were stuck with Trevor Smith, Jerred Smithson and Jay McClement. This year almost all of the new forwards can play multiple forward positions and most of them can also play center. This versatility could be a huge factor if the Leafs find themselves with multiple center injuries again, or injuries to any other forward position for that matter. They also seem to be interested in signing players who have something to prove to relatively low money deals which could be a huge factor in the new players performance. Additionally, most of the newly signed players are in what can be considered their prime as they are between the ages of 25 and 29. Therefore they may be able to help the Leafs more this year than some of the Leafs younger prospects who have very little NHL experience and may not be ready. The new defenders Polak and Robidas are two stay at home defensemen who are looking to bring some defensively sound hockey to a club that lacked it last season. There is a lot of new players with something to prove, but only time will tell if this seasons reinforcements will make a difference.\n\nIf you liked this article, I wrote an article previewing the Leafs’ 2014-15 season!\n\nCover Photo Credit: Getty Images – Abelimages via Getty Images",

  "latent_15080": "AMD president and CEO, Dr. Lisa Su, announced the company’s Q4 results, with revenue for the quarter coming in at $1.24 billion, with a gross margin of 29%. Earnings per share based on GAAP results was a loss of $0.47 per share. Compared to Q3, revenue dropped 13%, and year-over-year the drop was 22%. Operating income dropped $393 million from Q3 (623% decrease) and is well down from the Q4 2013 value of $135 million with a posted operating loss this quarter of $330 million. Net income fell from $17 million last quarter and $89 million last year to a $364 million loss, which is a pretty substantial change.\n\nAMD Q4 2014 Financial Results (GAAP) Q4'2014 Q3'2014 Q4'2013 Revenue $1.24B $1.43B $1.59B Operating Income -$330M $63M $135M Net Income -$364M $17M $89M Gross Margin 29% 35% 35% Earnings Per Share -$0.47 $0.02 $0.12\n\nAMD had three large reasons for the loss this quarter which hit their GAAP numbers pretty hard. First, they had yet another write down of their SeaMicro and ATI acquisitions, which they attribute to a decline in their stock prices. This cost them $233 million this quarter. Second, they have had to perform a write down for their second generation APU products, which they have listed higher on their balance sheets than they can sell them for now, however they do expect to sell through their inventory. This contributed to a $58 million non-cash charge. Finally, restructuring charges based on layoffs and the departure of their CEO, as well as real estate restructuring charges cost an additional $71 million. As these are all one time charges, AMD has also released Non-GAAP results which exclude these write downs.\n\nOn a Non-GAAP basis, operating income was $36 million, which is down 45% from last quarter’s $66 million value, and down year-over-year from the $91 million operating income from Q4 2013. Net income equates to $2 million, down from $20 million last quarter and $45 million last year, and Non-GAAP earnings per share is $0.00, which can also be spelled as zero, which missed analyst’s expectations of $0.01 per share. The core business is getting to the break-even point, and AMD has said that they have had six consecutive quarters of Non-GAAP profitability, but even that is on a razor’s edge with this quarter’s numbers.\n\nAMD Q4 2014 Financial Results (Non-GAAP) Q4'2014 Q3'2014 Q4'2013 Revenue $1.24B $1.43B $1.59B Operating Income $36M $66M $91M Net Income $2M $20M $45M Gross Margin 34% 35% 35% Earnings Per Share $0.00 $0.03 $0.06\n\nFull numbers for the year had revenue of $5.51 billion, up from $5.30 billion in 2013, and the GAAP operating loss was $155 million for 2014, down from the $103 million operating income for 2013. GAAP net income for 2014 was down as well, to a $403 million loss, exceeding 2013’s loss of $83 million. Non-GAAP values for 2014 were slightly better, with a $235 million operating income and a small profit of $51 million for the fiscal year. Once again, the core business is breaking even, but the heavy write downs are hurting the bottom line.\n\nLooking at individual business lines, the Computing and Graphics segment had a net revenue for Q4 of $662 million, down 15% from Q3 and down 16% from Q4 2013. Lower desktop processor and GPU sales are the blame over last quarter, and desktop processors and chipset sales are called out as the decrease over last year’s numbers. Operating loss for the segment was $56 million, as compared to $17 million in Q3 and $15 million in Q4 2013. Lower channel sales were partially offset by lower operating expenses. Average selling price actually increased both sequentially and year-over-year for processors and chipsets, but GPU selling price decreased year-over-year. This is a soft spot for AMD, and they are diversifying their business outside of the traditional PC space in an attempt to keep one weak line from hurting the company so much. In 2012, about 90% of AMD’s business was based on the traditional PC industry, and by 2014 it was down to 60%, with the other 40% consisting of professional graphics, semi-custom chips, ARM based server, embedded, and ultra low-power clients. By 2015 they are estimating that 50% of their business will be these new markets.\n\nLooking at the Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom group at AMD, you can see why they are moving that direction. For the full fiscal year, this group contributed $2.374 billion in revenue, and had an operating income of $399 million, both of these are up from 2013 where they managed only $1.577 billion in revenue and $295 million in operating income from this group. Looking at the quarter itself, revenue fell 16% from Q3’s $648 million to $577 million, which AMD attributed to a large run-up of chips for the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 in Q3, as Microsoft and Sony built up inventory for the holiday season. Operating income for Q4 was $109 million, down from $129 million Q4 2013 and up slightly from the $108 million last quarter.\n\nThe “All Other” category had no revenue for the quarter, but took a $383 million operating loss, which results in a 2014 operating loss of $478 million for the year. This is the category that is taking the write downs we have already discussed.\n\nLooking ahead to 2015, AMD is listing 2015 as “profitable” at least as far as Non-GAAP figures. Q1 2015 guidance is for a 15% drop in revenue, plus or minus 3%. Gross margin should be up 5% to 34%.\n\nAMD has seen some pretty serious competition in the PC segment, which is still their largest single contributor. Intel has just released their 14 nm parts, with a new CPU architecture due out later this year with Skylake. AMD does have a new APU on the horizon though with Carrizo, and they had working prototypes at CES. While CPU performance will likely not stun anyone due to the new CPU being still based on the Bulldozer architecture, GPU performance should be very competitive. These will be 15 to 35 watt parts, so as far as TDP they will compete against the just launched Broadwell-U. For lower power, AMD will have the Carrizo-L based on Puma+ CPU cores for the 10-25 watt range. All of this will still be on 28 nm though, which puts AMD at a pretty significant disadvantage for efficiency. The increased GPU power may be enough to sway some customers, since many people find they are not CPU bound anyway. Time will tell, and we look forward to seeing the new chips show up so we can test them out.\n\nSource: AMD Investor Relations",

  "latent_15256": "In the first decades of the 20th century, if you died in a city, one of the ways you might travel toward your final resting place was by public transit.\n\n“In L.A. in the early years, the cemeteries were right next to the churches,” says David Housh, curator of the Pacific Railroad Society. “Then those got too crowded, and they had to move them out to the countryside. And not too many people had cars.”\n\nThe result? In certain parts of the country, including the Los Angeles area, dedicated funeral cars were added to the streetcar systems. The only one that survives relatively intact is the Descanso (Spanish for “rest”), currently on display at the Orange Empire Railway Museum in Perris, California.\n\nThe Descanso (originally known as the Paraiso) was part of the Los Angeles Railway, or Yellow Line, which at its peak comprised 20 streetcar lines with 1,250 trolleys. Built in 1909 and available for chartered use by funeral parties at a cost of about $25, the Descanso was one of two funeral cars, designed with a compartment that opened to reveal a special folding casket carrier. The family sat with the coffin in an interior with touches including stained-glass windows. It was all very dignified, designed to accommodate people who wanted to avoid a bumpy ride over unpaved roads in a horse-drawn cart on their way to the lay a loved one to rest.\n\nThe Delores of Lorain, Ohio.

  "latent_15414": "Like other Australian cities, Sydney's rail system is consciously designed with the capacity to accommodate brief peaks of intense demand. Smoothing the peaks would reduce costs significantly\n\nSydney’s rail system is primarily a commuter system. The NSW Bureau of Transport Statistics‘ new report, Train Statistics 2014, shows that around two thirds of all weekday train travel in the metropolitan area is in peak periods.\n\nThe great bulk (88%) of train trips in the morning peak are for commuting (62%), education (21%) or work-related purposes (5%).\n\nIt’s evident from the exhibit that weekday demand for trains is extraordinarily peaked. It shows only the CBD rail stations but they’re very important; approximately half of all morning peak rail trips terminate or originate in the CBD. (1)\n\nPeaking imposes high costs because the system has to have the capacity to deliver a large number of passengers over a relatively brief period. That requires bigger stations with more staff than it would if the demand profile were relatively flat like it is on weekends.\n\nIt requires higher frequencies and hence more trains, more tracks, more sophisticated signalling, and more staff to manage trains and masses of passengers. The new lines through the city centre being planned for Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane are needed primarily to meet peak demand.\n\nUnlike Saturdays and Sundays, much of the capacity required to meet weekday peaks isn’t used for the rest of the day. If Sydney could reduce the morning peak demand to (say) the same maximum as the afternoon peak, it’s likely there would be very significant capital and operating cost savings.\n\nThere are a number of ways policy-makers could reduce peaking (and I expect these are all on the NSW government’s radar to a greater or lesser extent).\n\nPerhaps the most straightforward way is through ticket pricing; setting higher fares in the peak relative to the off-peak to encourage commuters – and their employers – to shift their time of travel. This could be complemented by other policies to encourage travellers to use rail in lieu of cars for off-peak travel.\n\nA longer term approach would be to aggressively develop regional centres like Parramatta as alternative locations to the CBD for some firms. Government might take the lead in shifting more of its activities out of the city centre.\n\nAnother approach would be to acknowledge that peaking in the CBD happens because it provides real advantages, principally coordination and agglomeration benefits for city centre firms and organisations. Those beneficiaries could be required to contribute directly to the cost of providing and operating the necessary infrastructure.\n\nThere are benefits as well as costs to CBD peaking e.g. a more decentralised land use pattern might lead to higher levels of car use for commuting. However given the politicised nature of planning and the many implicit subsidies, it seems highly unlikely that the current “balance” is optimal.\n\nIf around 15,000 passengers could be induced to evenly redistribute their time of arrival in the CBD from the 8:00 am – 9:00 am peak to adjoining periods, it would reduce the maximum load at the CBD stations to the same average level as the 5:00 pm – 6:00 pm period.\n\n____________",

The contrast between the lofty liberal ideals espoused by such leftists and their sordid output should concern us all, though, of whatever political persuasion. They have largely succeeded in squelching forthright, reasoned discourse about Islam and Islamist terrorism, which jeopardizes national security and the lives of some of some of the most vulnerable, including women who have left the faith, or who, rightfully or wrongfully, are accused of disrespecting it. For in de facto alliance with regressive leftist denouncers of “Islamophobia” — a semantic swindle of a noun equating criticism of Islam with bigotry against Muslims as people — stand assassins, as the late Elsa Cayat of Charlie Hebdo, the late Farkhunda Malikzada of Afghanistan, and countless victims of honor killings would attest, were they still alive.\n\nThat this is no laughing matter has not stopped regressive leftists from doing their utmost to look ridiculous, if in a sinister sort of way. In attempting to discourage criticism of Islam — a faith they mostly do not profess — they de facto defend the right of one group of humans to oppress another group on the basis of their religion. Their talent for tragicomic perfidy shines through most clearly in their prodigious efforts to take down one woman in particular — a woman whose life story, by any rational, humane standards, should win encomia from, and the admiration of, decent people everywhere — the courageous, Somali-born author, human rights activist, and public intellectual Ayaan Hirsi Ali.\n\nIn the space of four decades, Hirsi Ali suffered genital mutilation, donned the hijab and joined the Muslim Brotherhood, escaped a forced marriage and fled Africa for Holland, mastered Dutch and earned a graduate degree from a prestigious university, abandoned Islam after the 9/11 attacks awakened her intellectually, got herself elected to the Dutch parliament, publicly denounced the abuse suffered by immigrant Muslim women in Holland, wrote the screenplay for a short film about misogyny in Islam (for which its director, Theo van Gogh, was murdered by an Islamist in Amsterdam and for which his killer condemned her to death as well), found herself (following controversy over her asylum status) immigrating, in 2006, to the United States (where she was welcomed by Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick as a “very courageous and impressive woman”), and established a foundation to protect women from honor killings and aid women’s development globally. She is now a fellow at Harvard’s John F. Kennedy School of Government. Death threats have shadowed her since 2002, when she first started speaking out against Islam, and even today she requires round-the-clock armed guards.

  "latent_15642": "Less than a year after Hurricane Matthew raked the East Coast, killing 34 people and causing $10 billion in damage in the U.S. alone, coastal areas are once again preparing for the onset of the Atlantic hurricane season.\n\nThis year, forecasters with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration are expecting to see above-average storm numbers in the Atlantic, despite the uncertainty of whether an El Niño will develop over the summer. The forecast is currently for 11 to 17 named storms to form, of which five to nine are expected to become hurricanes, and two to four major hurricanes.\n\nThe forecast, though, “does not predict when, where, and how these storms might hit,” Ben Friedman, the acting NOAA administrator said during a press conference, as he and other officials urged coastal residents to begin their preparations.\n\nDuring Thursday’s press conference, officials also touted the updated models and tools they have to produce better forecasts for individual storms, part of a concerted effort that has greatly improved hurricane forecasts over the past couple of decades. Those comments, though, come just a few days after the release of President Trump’s budget request, which calls for reductions to some of those very programs.\n\nThe 2017 hurricane season got off to an early start, with Tropical Storm Arlene forming in April, only the second April storm in the satellite era. Early storms, however, are not necessarily indicators of how active a given season will be.\n\nTo gauge the hurricane season, forecasters use various climatological clues, such as the state of the El Niño cycles, as well as expected trends in ocean temperatures and a measure called wind shear, which can cut off storm formation.\n\nEl Niño is a key factor in making hurricane seasonal forecasts because the changes in atmospheric patterns over the tropical Pacific that it ushers in have a domino effect on patterns over the Atlantic, tending to suppress hurricane formation.\n\nWhether an El Niño will develop is currently something of a question mark, though, with the odds about even for El Niño or neutral conditions this summer and fall. Also uncertain is whether any El Niño that does materialized will be strong enough to influence the Atlantic.\n\nBut sea surface temperatures across swaths of the Atlantic are currently above average and are expected to stay that way, and wind shear is also expected to stay low, both of which would tend to support more storm formation.\n\nSo given the signals that forecasters have to work with, they expect a 45 percent chance of above-average storm numbers, a 35 percent chance of near-normal, and only a 20 percent chance of below-normal activity.\n\nThose percentages translate to the ranges of numbers of storms expected at different strengths. The 11 to 16 named storms include those that reach tropical storm status or higher, defined as a storm with wind speeds of 39 mph or higher. Five to nine of those storms would be expected to strengthen into hurricanes, with winds in excess of 74 mph. And then two to four of those hurricanes would be expected to reach major hurricane status, defined as Category 3 or above on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane strength, or winds above 111 mph.\n\nAn average Atlantic season has 12 named storms, six hurricanes, and three major hurricanes.\n\nNOAA evaluates the accuracy of its seasonal forecasts each year, with the aim of seeing the number of storms fall in the given ranges at least 70 percent of the time, which they do consistently, Gerry Bell, lead seasonal hurricane forecaster with NOAA’s Climate Prediction Center, said.\n\nIt has been a record-setting 12 years since a major hurricane made landfall on the U.S. coast; the last to do so was Hurricane Wilma during the blockbuster 2005 season.\n\n“While some may think that’s lucky . . . in fact, tropical storms and lesser hurricanes can be just as damaging and just as deadly,” Friedman said, citing Matthew as a prime example. Matthew, which was for a time the first Category 5 hurricane to form in the Atlantic since Hurricane Felix in 2007, had weakened to a Category 1 storm by the time it made landfall in South Carolina last October.\n\nThe punishing storm surge that pushed ashore from Florida to the Carolinas and the torrential rains it dropped inland still made it the 10th costliest storm recorded in the Atlantic basin, according to the reinsurance firm Aon Benfield.\n\nStorm surge and heavier downpours are two areas where climate change is exerting an influence on the damage produced by hurricanes. As global temperature rise, sea level rises too, meaning hurricane surges can reach further inland. Rising temperatures also concentrate moisture in the atmosphere, providing more fuel for heavy rains.\n\nThe impact of climate change on hurricanes themselves is active area of research; the general consensus is that there may be fewer storms overall in a warmer world, but a higher proportion of them will be major hurricanes. Major hurricanes have already increased in the Atlantic since 1970.\n\nSome research has also suggested that the hurricane season could become longer, meaning more pre-season storms like Arlene.\n\nDuring the press conference, Mary Erickson, deputy director of National Weather Service, touted the increased accuracy of hurricane forecasts resulting from investments into improving models. In the 25 years since Hurricane Andrew devastated southeastern Florida, the 3-day track forecast for hurricanes has improved by 65 percent, she said.\n\nTwo new models coming online this season could improve forecasts even more. One, the Hurricane Weather Research Forecast model includes better resolution of storms, advanced ways of feeding data into the model and more accurate atmospheric physics, all of which could improve intensity forecasts for storms by up to 10 percent and track forecasts by up to 7 percent, Erickson said.\n\nAnother model replaces the retiring Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory Hurricane Model after 22 years, and it also improves track and intensity forecasts.\n\nMany of the improvements to those models have come as part of a concerted effort called the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program. That program was established by NOAA in 2009, in part as a response to the pummeling the U.S. received from a number of hurricanes during the early years of that decade and the relative lack of progress made in improving forecasts up to that point.\n\nTrump’s 2018 budget request currently includes a $5 million reduction in funding \"to slow the transition of advanced modeling research into operations for improved warnings and forecasts\" including the HFIP.\n\nThat budget provision doesn’t jibe with bipartisan-supported Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2017, which the President signed into law last month and which states that “NOAA must plan and maintain a project to improve hurricane forecasting.”\n\n“I don't think Congress will take his proposal seriously at all . . . so it can probably be ignored in favor of the legislation that has actually passed,” Brian McNoldy, a hurricane researcher at the University of Miami, said in an email. “But supposing Congress did pass his budget as-is, yes, it would be devastating to weather prediction across the board, including hurricanes.”\n\nForecasters will also be able to use the improved observations of the GOES-16 satellite, which has four times the resolution and updates five times faster than its predecessors. In particular, its lightning mapper will help forecasters better understand how a storm is developing, as lightning often accompanies rapid storm development. When it becomes operational later this year, GOES-16 will move into orbit over the East Coast, in prime hurricane-watching position, Friedman said..\n\nNOAA is also making its previously experimental storm surge watches and warnings operational this year, in an effort to better prepare coastal areas under threat of flooding. Hurricane graphics will also include an experimental visualization of how far damaging winds extend out from the center of a storm.\n\nNOAA will update its forecast in early August, just before the typical peak of the hurricane season.\n\nThis article is reproduced with permission from Climate Central.

The United States has designated Saeed-led organizations — the Laskkar e Toiba (LeT) and the Jama’at-ud-Da’wah (JuD) as foreign terrorist organisations. Hafiz Saeed has also been listed as a terrorist by the UN Security Council’s 1267 Al Qaeda Sanctions Committee.\n\nSouth Asia watchers in Washington say that by allowing a terrorist to take up a government sponsored cause, Islamabad has bared its selective approach towards terrorism. When banned outfits are allowed to openly hold rallies in Pakistan at the behest of the government, the allegations about Pakistan using terror as state policy appears to gain ground.\n\nExperts say that had Pakistan banned Saeed from holding this rally, and instead placed someone else in charge of the July 19 protests, then that would have been understandable. The question that arises in the minds of South Asian analysts is why Saeed? Is it because he is a terror asset which the state cannot do without?\n\nWatch Video: What’s making news\n\nExperts have questioned is Saeed so important that Islamabad is risking an important relationship with the United States.\n\nPakistan’s irrevocable links with Saeed have disappointed the Obama Administration, but has not shocked officials.

This connection was also highlighted by a European Parliament Report by Vice President Ryszard Czarnecki, where he pointed out how the Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation (FIF), a charity front of the LeT was radicalising Pakistani Diaspora while the state was a mute spectator.\n\nThe Saeed-Pakistan linkage as evidenced by the July 19 Kashmir rally is certain to be brought up on Capitol Hill where proposals are afoot to cut financial aid to Pakistan in the absence of a complete and verifiable delinkage with terror groups.\n\nAdvertising\n\nWhile the Obama Administration has been supporting Pakistan as an important ally in the war against terror, this latest incident of July 19 where a wanted terrorist has been given state patronage is certain to raise questions and embarrass the former.",
  "latent_16009": "This story was first published in Environmental Health News.\n\nChavel Lopez lives just a few miles north of Texas' Eagle Ford—one of the many regions in the country recently given a makeover from the fracking industry. \"I just have to drive a bit south and see the wells and the flames,\" he said.\n\nFor Lopez, rather than a booming industry, these are signs of yet another pollution burden for the region's people of color.\n\n\"We already had issues. Right here in San Antonio, fuel storage tanks were all located on the eastside, predominantly African American neighborhoods,\" he said. \"For some of these Hispanic neighborhoods, they were already dealing with uranium mining impacts and now the fracking of oil and gas.\"\n\nAnd new evidence supports his fears: Poor and minority neighborhoods bear a disproportionate share of fracking wastewater wells in South Texas' Eagle Ford play, according to a new study.\n\nThe findings add to growing evidence that politically marginalized black, Hispanic and poor communities carry more than their share of the nation's energy waste burden. Fracking wastewater contains potentially harmful chemicals and metals, and has been linked to surface and groundwater contamination and earthquake spikes.\n\n\"It's another example of the environmental racism throughout the country,\" said lead author Jill Johnston, an assistant professor at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine.\n\nIndustry representatives, however, called the study flawed, and said it provided no evidence that wastewater disposal is actually harming people in these communities.\n\nFracking, or hydraulic fracturing, is a process that uses horizontal drilling and high volume fluid injections to release oil and gas. Along with water, the injections contain sand and a mix of chemicals—some of which have been linked to cancer, hormone impacts, and reproductive problems.\n\nIt's estimated that every well produces about five million liters of wastewater, which is eventually pumped into disposal wells.\n\nAfter the Southwest Workers Union—where Lopez works as the labor coordinator—expressed concern about Eagle Ford fracking waste, Johnston and colleagues looked at the racial and economic makeup of residents where oil and gas disposal wells were permitted between 2007 and 2014 in the heavily fracked Eagle Ford area of Texas. The Eagle Ford covers 26 counties and has seen explosive growth as improvements in fracking technology opened the previously untappable reserves. Researchers estimated more than 1,000 new wastewater wells have been permitted in the area since 2007.\n\nThey found that—after controlling for population density—people in areas that were more than 80 percent minority were twice as likely to live near permitted wastewater wells than areas less than 20 percent minority.\n\nOf the more than 217,000 minorities living less than three miles from a disposal well, 83 percent were Hispanic, according to the study published last month in the American Journal of Public Health.\n\nOne main concern with disposal wells is that wastewater will make it back to surface water or contaminate nearby groundwater, said Desiree Plant, an assistant professor of chemical and environmental engineering at Yale University who was not involved in the study.\n\nA separate study published last month in the Journal of Exposure Science & Environmental Epidemiology reported, \"hydraulic-fracturing fluids and wastewater from unconventional oil and natural gas development contain hundreds of substances with the potential to contaminate drinking water.\" The authors discovered that many compounds found are linked to reproductive and development impacts.\n\n\"A lot of people there [Eagle Ford area] are reliant on groundwater, putting this all underground is jeopardizing water sources,\" Johnston said, adding that the additional truck traffic and other disposal infrastructure only adds to the burden.\n\nPlant said some harmful pollutants such as benzene also can volatize from wastewater and taint the air near disposal wells.\n\nIn addition, oil and gas disposal wells are linked to earthquake spikes in states such as Oklahoma, Texas and Kansas. Injected wastewater flows into faults, decreasing the resistance to geologic processes that trigger earthquakes, said Justin Rubinstein, a USGS research geophysicist, in a lecture last summer.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey estimates that in the central and eastern U.S. from 1973 and 2008 there was an average of 21 earthquakes a year magnitude 3 and larger—that average jumped to 99 from 2009 to 2013, correlating with the fracking boom.\n\nTexas is the nation's number one oil and gas producer. It has more than 8,000 oil and gas wastewater disposal wells. The Railroad Commission of Texas oversees the wells but locations are chosen by disposal operators, said Ramona Nye, a spokesperson for the Commission.\n\nOil and gas representatives funneled questions to the Independent Petroleum Association of America's outreach program called Energy in Depth. Spokesman Steve Everley first questioned via email whether the authors were \"using proximity to minorities as a media hook.\"\n\n\"What the authors did was pick an area that is well known as a major oil and gas producing region, and has a very high Hispanic population, and then 'discovered' that oil and gas development is happening in areas with high Hispanic populations,\" he said in a follow-up email, adding that many heavily Hispanic counties in the Eagle Ford have had unemployment numbers fall over the past five years.\n\nThe authors didn't examine siting decisions for disposal wells, Everley noted, which suggests, \"that this was more about promoting a particular narrative—one that was probably crafted before any 'data' were collected.\"\n\nJohnston countered that they found fracking activity slightly more prevalent in white communities but wastewater wells more frequently in communities of color.\n\nThe study follows a pattern for U.S. energy waste.\n\nLast year researchers reported that fracking wells in Pennsylvania's Marcellus Shale region are disproportionately located in poor rural communities. And it's not just oil and gas—federal officials are discussing how to ease the coal ash burden on poor, minority communities, and a 2012 NAACP survey of all 378 coal-powered plants in the U.S. found they heavily impact low income minorities.\n\nJohnston and colleagues wrote that marginalized communities are often targeted \"because of the perceived lack of political power and limited resources with which to challenge a permit.\"\n\n\"We have the wrong complexion for protection,\" Lopez said.",

Unless Republicans run the table on the white vote, they lose.\n\nIf there's still hope, it lies with Trump and only Trump. Donald Trump will do better with black and Hispanic voters than any other Republican. But it's with white voters that he really opens up the electoral map.\n\nA Republican Party that wasn't intent on committing suicide would know that. But Stuart Stevens, the guy who lost a winnable presidential election in 2012, says it's impossible for Republicans to get one more white vote -- and the media are trying to convince the GOP that he's right.\n\nStevens says Romney tapped out every last white voter and still lost, so he says Republicans are looking for \"the Lost Tribes of the Amazon\" hoping to win more white votes: \"In 1980, Ronald Reagan won 56 percent of white voters and won a landslide victory of 44 states. In 2012, Mitt Romney won 59 percent of whites and lost with 24 states.\"\n\nApparently, no one's told Stevens about the 50-state Electoral College. The national white vote is irrelevant. Presidential elections are won by winning states.

What sense does it make to talk about his national percentage of the white vote with disparities like that?\n\nRomney lost the white vote to Obama in five crucial swing states: Maine (42 percent of the white vote), Minnesota (47 percent), New Hampshire (48 percent), Iowa (48 percent) and Wisconsin (49 percent).

You do not get to borrow at those rates, only the member banks do. In the latest currency swap (loan) from the Fed to the ECB, European Central Bank, as we noted in previous issues over the last two months, that Europe has been forced to join the Anglo-American system. The system of zero interest rates and the continual creation of money and credit. Due to the Fed’s ability to create endless supplies of money and credit it eventually took over the control of ECB and European monetary policy. These policies starkly point out the zero interest rates and monetary policy of endless money creation is the path to be taken probably by all in the system to lesser or greater degrees. That means no savings and that leaves speculation and the purchase of gold and silver related assets. Looking at monetary history we would categorize this policy as Neanderthal. The recession/depression that the Fed has been tying to neutralize via zero interest rates and quantitative easing hasn’t worked and it won’t work. What is worse is the Fed knows it won’t work. Greenspan and Bernanke saw 21 years of such policy not work in Japan, yet they learned very little from living history. An example that zero interest rates do not work and render currency meaningless is the housing market. They cannot even lower bank home inventory with 3.8% loans. That tells you lower interest rates are not the answer. More jobs are the answer and where are they? They are in some other country under free trade, globalization, offshoring and outsourcing. It is far more important that transnational conglomerates make mega profits. Zero interest rates and quantitative easing stifle many things. It causes banks not to lend and to hold cash and as well be in no real hurry to get rid of real estate inventory. They figure the zero interest rates and QE will go on indefinitely. Such a climate also leads banks to speculate. If our take on the financial sector is correct it will be a hole before the bottom comes out of the system. The ability of the elitists to keep the game going until hyperinflation manifests itself is very good. You just saw that with a $1 trillion loan from the Fed to the ECB. They can make as many of these loans as they please until the system signals no more. How long will that take, who knows? All we know is that gold and silver will rise in that process.\n\nThe FOMC, the Federal Open Market Committee, which gives marching orders to Ben Bernanke, has said its goal is to devalue the dollar by 1/3 over the next 20 years. As you can see we may well see years of devaluation zero interest rates and quantitative easing. Again the only alternative to save the value of your assets is to own gold and silver related assets. What an admission. This will be the fallout from excusing monetary creation. The FOMC also said there would only be 2% inflation over that period. Of course, any sane person can hardly believe that. Just think what it is really going to be. If you want a glimpse of the future, but in a speeded-up timeframe, just envision the 98% loss in the value of the dollar since 8/15/71 and compact it into 3 to 5 years. All fixed income investments will lose purchasing power. Those in regular shares will have to be lucky enough to get out near the top and switch to gold and silver related investments. The smart investor will have been long this dynamic for a number of years. Now you can see that US dollar holders will be the ones who have been chosen by design to pay for the insane machinations of those who control our government. At its very worst the gold standard far outperforms the Keynesian monetary approach.\n\nBob Chapman on the Dubai Default Feb 2012 [Video/Audio]\n\nThe audios of Bob come from the Melody Cedarstrom radio show and The Marines Disquisition radio show both broadcast between the 5th-9th February 2012\n\nhttp://theunhivedmind.com/wordpress/?p=22800\n\nBob Chapman - WW3 Scenario\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ToZj70lbfGo&feature=email\n\nInterview 459 – The International Forecaster with Bob Chapman\n\nhttp://www.corbettreport.com/interview-459-the-international-forecaster-with-bob-chapman/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+CorbettReportRSS+%28The+Corbett+Report%29\n\nBob Chapman - Financial Survival - Feb. 13, 2012\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EUZzBFY9nTk&feature=email\n\nBob Chapman - RADIO LIBERTY -- February 13, 2012\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WhEGJVISr8&feature=email\n\nAfter laying off every worker they could corporate America is finding it harder to find income growth. Consumption worldwide has definitely been affected by the financial problems in Greece and Europe over the past four years. At the moment if Greece’s parliament does not pass enabling legislation this week, then Greece and the region face more difficult problems. If parliamentarians pass such legislation all that voted for it will be out of office in April. The ongoing demonstrations show you how outraged the public has been for the past two years. Even with a 70% haircut and austerity it would take Greece 30 years to exit depression. The idiots enforcing austerity expect revenues to grow. There is no way that can happen. Even if an agreement was signed it cannot be kept. They will need bailouts every year. That means despite trillions of dollars being thrown into the European caldron monetary chaos will continue in the EU for years to come. Just look at the heavy financing requirements this year. They will get financed but the eventual result will be brutal, in spite of all the money and credit being put into the system economies will struggle and earnings growth will fall. It will be a difficult year and 2013 will be even more difficult.\n\nAusterity is certainly taking hold in some EU countries making growth very difficult. In Portugal in December growth was minus 3.6% and in November 2.5%. In Greece it fell 2.9% in December and 6.2% in November. Even Germany and France are tightening up. In the euro zone year-on-year rates of growth fell to minus 0.3% from plus 8.1% in 2010. In that period the euro fell 12.8% versus the US dollar, which should have been helpful to the euro and European production and sales, but it wasn’t. In addition as we said earlier loose monetary policy on its very own undermines exporter’s profits offsetting the short-term advantages of currency debasement. Austerity cannot be applied at once no matter what situation. That simply strangles an economy making no recovery possible. If Europe does not ease up they’ll be in for more serious trouble next week.\n\nThe foregoing, of course, is complicated by UK, US, and NATO sanctions against Iran on oil sales and access to the world banking system, which is going to haunt the petrol dollar. It won’t be long before Iran shuts off Europe’s oil imports. That should help to flatten any European GDP growth expectations. Doesn’t the possibility of Iran selling oil for gold to India wake people up? Gold is the world premier currency and that is being demonstrated by just such discussing of its utility.\n\nIn 1933, it was the Communists that were the excuse that brought about the Enabling Act that brought Adolph Hitler to total power. Today we have terrorists that will enable that leap to power. Today’s propaganda is far-reaching and far more powerful and effective then anything Dr. Goebbels could have put together. It is overwhelming and unrelenting anti-privacy. Almost everything is being monitored and everything electronic you use will be accessed to fill government databases. Then we have the TSA, which assaults travelers in airports and now at internal checkpoints all over our nation. Interference in our lives is justified by terrorism, which is an excuse for pursuing suspicious activity or the possibility of pre-crime situations. If you look or act like a potential terrorist you can be arrested or detained without charges forever, simply disappearing from society. Americans, in order to continue their idyllic lifestyles have traded in their freedom and liberty for promises of security from terrorists. We give up our country to a group of totally insane elitists just as the Germans did so long ago. There is nothing sensible anymore. The middle class has lost its logic. They do not want to see through anything as long as they have theirs and nothing disrupts their lives. By living in this cocoon it allows Americans to live in their own world and overlook what their government is doing in their name. Do not forget living as prisoners makes us safer. You might ask why people would want to take our freedoms away from us? We can certainly understand a terrorists’ motivation, but the elitist’s goals are far more complicated. They want our hearts and our minds. They want to enslave us, because they consider us useless rabble to do as we are told. They want the complete submission of all societies.\n\nOf course there is no war on terror. Its beginnings began in the 1970s via the Iran Contra program and flowered from there into the vast penal system we see today. Our elected representatives have voted over 90% to help enslave us. These people are all paid off by those who want to enslave us – our own representatives – the people we put in office. They authorized our federal government to indefinitely imprison without charge or trial American citizens and others picked up inside and outside the US. There is absolutely no reason for such legislation and the public knows that, but few speak out. This is what happened in the Germany of the 1930s.\n\nThese terrorists are everyday people like you and us: veterans, gun owners, journalists and commentators, constitutionalists, gold and silver owners, home schoolers, those who are religious and those who dare to speak out.\n\nThe history of the last century was the precursor for today’s events. All the books are there to be read that inform you of your coming servitude, if you do not act to stop them. Your government and those who control it are coming at you from every angle, especially electronically and it is going to get worse. Buckle up and get ready for battle, because it will be a long and difficult one. Get Ron Paul elected as our president and we may be able to reverse this horrid situation we are in.\n\nPresident Obama on Monday unveiled a $3.8 trillion spending plan that seeks to pump billions of dollars into the economy while raising taxes on the rich to tame a soaring national debt now projected to grow significantly faster than previously forecast.\n\nThe president’s outlook for debt reduction has deteriorated markedly since September, when Obama told Congress that his proposals would hold annual deficits well under $600 billion after next year and permit the debt held by outside investors to rise to $17.7 trillion by 2021, or 73 percent of the overall economy.\n\nThe new 10-year blueprint shows annual deficits exceeding $600 billion every year except 2018. And the portion of the debt held by outside investors would grow to $18.7 trillion by 2021, or 76.5 percent of the economy — a full $1 trillion higher.\n\nThe White House announced plans on Monday to help \"Arab Spring\" countries swept by revolutions with more than $800 million in economic aid, while maintaining U.S. military aid to Egypt.\n\nIn his annual budget message to Congress, President Barack Obama asked that military aid to Egypt be kept at the level of recent years -- $1.3 billion -- despite a crisis triggered by an Egyptian probe targeting American democracy activists.\n\nThe proposals are part of Obama's budget request for fiscal year 2013, which begins October 1. His requests need the approval of Congress, where some lawmakers want to cut overseas spending to address U.S. budget shortfalls and are particularly angry at Egypt.\n\nObama proposed $51.6 billion in funding for the U.S. State Department and foreign aid overall, when $8.2 billion in assistance to war zones is included. The \"core budget\" for the category would increase by 1.6 percent, officials said.\n\nMost of the economic aid for the Arab Spring countries -- $770 million -- would go to establish a new \"Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund,\" the president said in his budget plan.\n\nAnalysts said it was difficult to tell how much of the proposal was actually new money.\n\n\"As presented it's very difficult to determine if the Arab spring fund is new wine in new bottles or old wine in new bottles,\" said John Norris, a former U.S. foreign aid worker now at the Center for American Progress.\n\nThe Middle East and North Africa Incentive fund \"will provide incentives for long-term economic, political, and trade reforms to countries in transition -- and to countries prepared to make reforms proactively,\" the White House budget document said.\n\nThe proposal said this approach \"expands our bilateral economic support in countries such as Tunisia and Yemen, where transitions are already underway.\"\n\nIt would also build on other programs for the area, including up to $2 billion in regional Overseas Private Investment Corporation financing, up to $1 billion in debt swaps for Egypt, and approximately $500 million in existing funds re-allocated to respond to the region last year, the budget document said.\n\nIt did not say how the Middle East and North Africa Incentive Fund would be divided between countries, or give any other details of the plan.\n\nEgypt has long been among the top recipients of U.S. aid, getting about $1.6 billion annually, mostly in military assistance. In fiscal 2012, $250 million of aid approved for Egypt was economic; $1.3 billion was military and there was a $60 million \"enterprise fund\" approved by Congress.\n\nNo U.S. assistance is moving to Egypt at the moment, U.S. lawmakers and their aides said last week. Some legislators favor cutting off aid to Egypt entirely if it does not drop accusations against American democracy activists and lift a travel ban on them.\n\nObama continued the practice of putting proposed foreign assistance for war zones in a separate account. This account, known as the \"Overseas Contingency Operations,\" includes $8.2 billion for the State Department and foreign aid.\n\nIt includes $3.3 billion for Afghanistan, $1 billion for Pakistan, and $4 billion for Iraq, where U.S. troops have left the country but the State Department has picked up some of their functions such as police training.\n\nBecause of the central bank’s cheap financing, some economists warn, sick banks now face less pressure to confront their problems to clean out bad loans and other impaired assets, or even wind down operations if there is no hope of a turnaround. The European Central Bank, they say, could inadvertently spawn a cohort of “zombie banks,” burdened by nonperforming loans and assets that remain on the books, like the ones that helped make the 1990s a lost decade for Japan…\n\nAs the experience of Japan showed in the 1990s, zombie banks tended to keep lending to troubled borrowers to avoid recognizing losses from bad loans. As a result, the healthiest and most productive companies struggled to find credit. “Zombie banks support zombie companies,” said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at Bruegel, a research organization in Brussels. “Zombie banks will not extend credit to borrowers that need it. This is bad for the economy.”…\n\nA gain in U.S. business inventories trailed the improvement in sales in December, showing companies may continue to restock shelves and warehouses in early 2012.\n\nThe 0.4 percent increase in stockpiles followed a 0.3 percent advance the prior month, Commerce Department data showed today in Washington. The median projection in a Bloomberg News survey called for a 0.5 percent rise. Sales climbed 0.7 percent, the most since July.\n\nPrices of goods imported into the U.S. rose in January for the second time in six months, reflecting higher costs for automobiles and petroleum.\n\nThe 0.3 percent gain in the import-price index follows a 0.1 percent decrease in December, Labor Department figures showed today in Washington. The increase matched the median projection of economists in a Bloomberg News survey. The cost of imported consumer goods excluding cars fell by the most since October 2010.\n\nSales at U.S. retailers rose less than forecast in January, reflecting an unexpected drop in purchases of automobiles.\n\nThe 0.4 percent gain reported by the Commerce Department today in Washington was half the 0.8 percent rise median forecast of economists surveyed by Bloomberg News. Purchases excluding car dealers climbed 0.7 percent, more than projected and the biggest gain since March.\n\nRetailers like Target Corp. and Limited Brands Inc. topped analysts’ sales forecasts last month, when many companies offered incentives to bring back shoppers after holiday sales stagnated. Further gains in employment are needed to bolster wages and underpin confidence, ensuring that demand can be sustained.\n\nGene Sperling, director of the White House's national economic council, said today at an official meeting that \"we need a global minimum tax\":\n\nWho gets to set the global tax; who collects it; and who determines where it is spent?\n\nAs of Monday, about 1.28 million voters were registered in the city, board spokesman James Allen said.\n\nThat’s lower than in 1942, the first year such numbers are recorded in the agency’s records.",
  "latent_16246": "\"I was always kind of second. I've always been the underdog in that sense. I've been chosen, but I've always been the second cast.\"\n\nIf the ridiculously accomplished woman saying this weren't so earnest, I'd roll my eyes. But since I can almost see the imposter syndrome clutched in her sinewy limbs, I don't. Instead, I keep staring at her face and the poreless complexion that looks 17 years old when it's really 31. I realize that for women like Ashley Laracey—an elite ballerina—these two things must be related: the stepped-out-of-a-cryogenic-freezer skin and the frigid self-criticism. Like \"underdog\" Laracey, many ballerinas dance all day, never seeing much sunlight, and, despite the hours of grueling practice and self-flagellation, never think it's enough.\n\nMorning is the only part of Laracey's day that's unusually relaxed. At 9 A.M. in her Upper West Side apartment, she's sock-footed on the couch with her husband, fellow New York City Ballet member Troy Schumacher, sipping a protein shake and coffee. It's not until 9:40 A.M. that Laracey makes her way to work, where she'll take classes and rehearse upcoming performances until 7 P.M. Like all other NYCB dancers, she works six days per week, with Monday as her only day off.\n\nWhen evening performances commence on September 23, Laracey will often work until 10:45 P.M. \"We're tired now, but we're not, like, really, really tired,\" she says. Still, if she wanted it, she has an excuse to be especially exhausted. On yesterday's \"off\" day, she danced for an all-day photo shoot before attending class at Fordham University from 6 P.M. to 8:45 P.M. At 31, Laracey's older than most Fordham juniors, of course, but slowly chipping away at her communications and business credits has paid off for her career: Last year, she was promoted from the company's corps (53 members) to its soloists (15 members), a jump many dancers never make.\n\nDespite her huge accomplishment, Laracey aspires to become one of the company's 23 principals. Being a principal is the company's highest honor, and even in Laracey's 10:30 A.M. class, the hierarchy is palpable: Veteran dancers claim the spots closer to the front of the class, while corps members hang out in the back. As Laracey finds her place near the front of the room, wraps her toes in painter's tape, and eases into her first split of the morning, Sterling Hyltin, her friend of 13 years, assumes a place directly in front of Laracey. Hyltin, I later learn, is a principal.\n\nAt 12:25 P.M., after practice, we walk 12 blocks uptown so she can hit the pool at the Jewish Community Center. While many dancers elliptical away this lunchtime break at an Equinox near NYCB, Laracey goes out of her way to swim. (She swears it's because she enjoys it, not because she's anxious to expel more calories.) She never counts the laps, she says—largely to ensure that it remains an outlet, not an obsession.\n\n\"I've had an eating disorder; I understand that thought process,\" she says after completing 15 minutes of flawless freestyle. But she's now made a commitment to a healthy lifestyle—\"Troy [my husband] was very helpful with that\"—and she thinks the company has made serious strides, too, in raising awareness and providing resources (counselors, nutritionists, etc). \"At this point, it's definitely way better than when I got here 10 years ago,\" she says.\n\nYet, the same The New York Times piece that lauded Laracey's dancing ability last year—saying she possessed \"delicacy, authority, [and] refinement\" when she dances—also remarked that \"her figure is ravishing, with slender, tapering limbs,\" as if a show review is incomplete without a critique of the dancers' bodies. (Of course, the body talk is not always positive: In 2010, one of Laracey's idols, Jenifer Ringer, was famously lampooned for looking \"as if she'd eaten one sugarplum too many.\") Beyond her internal dialogue or NYCB, weight is still very much part of the larger discourse; thinness, still the ideal.\n\nAfter showering and lunching on yogurt and fruit, Laracey returns to NYCB, where she prepares for an afternoon rehearsal of Justin Peck's Belles-Lettres. She is now, no longer chlorine-haired or street-clothed, the archetypal ballerina: a wispy tulle skirt and taut bun pirouetting. It's 4 P.M., and Laracey gets no corrections from Peck on her pas de deux, though, naturally, she's expecting them. I ask her what she does when the criticism is harsher; if it ever gets to be too much; and if she'd ever cry in front of her fellow company members. She tries not to, she says, because, \"They see it as weak if you can't handle it. They don't want to deal with drama—they have so much drama to deal with all day long. And if you cry, they see you more as a child instead of an adult.\"\n\nCrying about physical pain is a different thing, however. No one faulted Laracey for sobbing after she ripped three ligaments during 2004's George Balanchine's The Nutcracker. After the setback, Laracey couldn't dance for an entire year: she was \"out,\" not just \"injured,\" which dancers always are on some level. Today, post-rehearsal, Laracey's FHL tendon is bugging her, so at 5:15 P.M., she ducks into a windowless room lined with anatomy charts to consult the company's physical therapist. The most important thing, she's learned, is to treat new ailments immediately so they don't get worse, so you don't traverse from \"injured\" to \"out.\" Because, she says, \"When you're out, you feel worthless; you feel disposable.\"\n\nNow, it's 6 P.M. and Laracey needs to watch a friend's rehearsal (she promised) and do some more interviews before she can head home to spend time with her husband. Maybe they'll drink a glass of wine or watch an episode of House of Cards or Orange Is the New Black before they fall asleep, but that's about as wild as things get. She's an early bird, and most of her friends are dancers, wed to the same demanding schedule. If not, maybe she'll carve out some time with her \"outside friends,\" people she meets through her career, but in lieu of dancers are \"composers, musicians, editors, all kind of in the art realm,\" she explains, \"but not really any non-artistic people. I don't have time to meet them.\"\n\nAt least, not for the next decade: At 31, Laracey knows the curtain's creeping in at the corners of her tenure, but she thinks she can dance professionally until she's 40, and \"hopefully longer.\" After that? Maybe Denmark. She's got dreams about a second career, maybe as a certified financial planner. For now, though, she's focused on working, on dancing, on mastering the job's biggest challenge, which she says is \"believing in yourself day in and day out, and not letting yourself defeat yourself before you've even been given the chance.\"\n\n\"I think that's the hardest part,\" she says. \"This is not meant to sound conceited, but dance is easy for me; I don't have to work to lift my leg. It's more the mental [stuff] that's hard. I'm not as tough as I should be.\" Having seen firsthand how she navigates the demands of her day, I know she's incredibly, incredibly tough on the inside—and out. No one doubts that. Except, of course, Laracey, the Alpha dog who sees an underdog whenever she looks in the mirror.\n\nSee Ashley Laracey perform in Justin Peck's 'Belles-Lettres,' which premieres tonight, and runs again on October 2, October 7, October 9, and October 11 at New York City's David H.

Even if job growth slows in May as expected, economists say it should not be viewed as a loss of momentum in the labor market and the economy as payrolls would still be above the average for the preceding six months.\n\nData ranging from manufacturing to automobile sales suggest economic activity is rebounding after declining in the first quarter when it was weighed down by an unusually harsh winter weather and a slow pace of inventory accumulation.\n\nThe claims report showed the number of people still receiving benefits after an initial week of aid declined 20,000 to 2.60 million in the week ended May 24.

  "latent_16476": "Under the Skin is, no doubt, a troubling film. Many critics have hailed it as a masterpiece of the medium, triumphing its striking cinematography and meticulously constructed visual narrative. I don’t hope to undermine these aspects of the film, as they are certainly nothing short of remarkable. There’s no doubt that Under the Skin is a feast for the eyes. But, as my eyes ate up the spectacle and chomped down on the vistas, my mind starved. At its best, it is unsettling. At its worst, it feels watered down, disjointed, and sporadically paced.\n\nThe film follows an otherworldly Scarlett Johansson’s predatory search for men on the fringe of society. Driving through Edinburgh, preying on unsuspecting hitchhikers, Johansson seduces the men and brings them back to her secluded, dilapidated abode. Therein, she strips down to her underwear, and lures them into shiny black goo for… reasons unexplained. Her victims become preserved in the reflective goop, until they… uh.. pop. Loudly. Then, after picking up a disfigured man, Scarlett expresses remorse for whatever it is that she’s doing, and abandons her course to gallivant around the Scottish countryside. Consequently, four anonymous motorcyclists, who are hinted to be collaborators in her ambiguous alien activity, pursue her. A few indulgent sequences later, the film ends with no resolution, clarification, or purpose.\n\nI suppose that is my biggest critique of the film: it simply fails to go anywhere in particular. Its ambience and visual scope is impressive, but fails to carry the story single-handedly. There simply isn’t enough in the film that warrants emotional involvement outside of the nicely constructed visual motifs.\n\nThat said, the journey is definitely an experience. Glazer achieves some incredible sequences of abstract beauty, and many of those moments completely took me out of my seat and placed me firmly in the realm of the imagined. The opening shot inspired wonder, and intrigued me, and my intrigue was held up until the moment I realised that it was never to be satisfied. In addition, the candid shots of Edinburgh gave the film a real sense of striking realism, which played nicely next to the sequences of absolute abstraction. The continual dialogue between light and dark, though a trite visual conceit, was well realised and was well developed throughout.\n\nAs diluted as the story is, there are some deeply impactful moments, most notably in the first half of the film, when I was still under the impression that it was all building to something. One scene in particular stands out as the zenith of the slogging suspense. Attempting to seduce a Czech surfer, Scarlett the Alien sees a family swept out to sea, leaving behind a wailing toddler. It was genuinely harrowing seeing the child left behind, and as is to be expected, the film pulled no punches in making me feel all squirmy inside. The problem is, this uneasiness only ever arose in brief instances, and failed to give the film uniformity and undermined its vision.\n\nOverall, Under the Skin is an occasionally unsettling, ultimately unfulfilling exploration of the filmic medium. It contains stunning aesthetics, but underwhelming storytelling. There are a few gems hidden in this sea of slick black goo, but I’m not sure it’s worth getting swallowed up to find them.\n\n★★★\n\nDirector: Johnathan Glazer\n\nWriters: Walter Campbell, Michel Faber\n\nCast: Scarlett Johansson, Paul Brannigan, Jessica Mance\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_16693": "Roy Price was fired amid accusations of sexual harassment this week.\n\nIt would be nice to think that former Amazon Studios chief Roy Price resigned from his job because company founder and CEO Jeff Bezos simply couldn’t tolerate the idea that one of his key executives had sexually harassed a key producer. Unfortunately, there’s little evidence to support that notion. Quite the contrary: Amazon and Bezos knew of the allegations against Price for two years but took no public disciplinary action against him until last week, when producer Isa Hackett told her full story to The Hollywood Reporter’s Kim Masters. Amazon acted only after the combination of the THR article and the revelations about Harvey Weinstein made Price’s continued employment politically untenable. But a third factor, one unrelated to Price’s personal behavior, may have also played a role in the decision to finally make a change: Bezos, it seems, simply wasn’t happy with how Price was running Amazon’s TV business. Now that Price is gone, Hollywood is wondering whether his departure will mark the beginning of an even bigger shake-up at the streamer.\n\nAny investigation into what’s happening at Amazon Studios, the umbrella unit that oversees programming for Amazon Prime Video, is complicated by the fact that Bezos has been conspicuously quiet in recent months about the service. He didn’t offer a statement when Price departed, and it’s been months since he offered any extensive comments on the overall health of Prime Video. But many in Hollywood apparently are convinced Bezos is dissatisfied, and before he resigned, Price was acting as if his boss wanted a change. In a Variety article published in early September, the now-departed exec pretty much said as much. The article — unambiguously headlined “Jeff Bezos Mandates Programming Shift at Amazon Studios” — reported Bezos had ordered the streamer to focus more on what Price described as “big shows that can make the biggest difference around the world.” While Amazon has gotten critical love (and a few Emmys) for series such as Transparent, One Mississippi, and Man in the High Castle, Price — presumably speaking for Bezos — sounded as if both he and his then-boss weren’t satisfied with the status quo at the streamer. “We’re a mass-market brand,” the former Amazon Studios chief told Variety. “We have a lot of video customers and we need shows that move the needle at a high level.”\n\nOf course, since Bezos hasn’t spoken out at all, it’s impossible to know whether Price’s comments truly represent Bezos’s thinking — or were simply intended as a distraction from Price’s own troubles. Remember: His comments to Variety came just a couple weeks after Masters published a preliminary story about the sexual-harassment allegations against Price at the subscription-based business news site the Information. It’s not far-fetched to think Price preferred to talk about how he was moving to chart a new direction at Prime rather than charges he had created a hostile environment for producers and talent working under him.\n\nStill, Variety’s story also cited sources outside Amazon noting they’d been hearing of a course change at Amazon for weeks, even before the Masters bombshell. And whether Price knew it at the time, The Wall Street Journal was weeks away from publishing its own brutal takedown of how Amazon Studios was managed. (More on that later.) Whatever Price’s motives for embracing the “Amazon needs to go broader” narrative, one senior Hollywood agent with millions of dollars in business at the streamer says it’s hard to see how Price wasn’t legitimately in the process of changing focus. This agent argues Bezos has to be at least somewhat disappointed with the company’s streaming progress. “Amazon is all about being a category killer,” noting the company’s dominance of publishing, online retailing, and other markets. “He wants to win.”\n\nBut what exactly does winning look like for a streamer like Amazon? The Variety article suggests finding a monster success such as Game of Thrones is the goal, but the amount of money needed to produce and market a series as ambitious as Thrones is not insignificant, even for a company as big (and risk-taking) as Amazon. Stand-alone video entities like Netflix or HBO or AMC clearly need big programs to drive subscriptions to their services, but Amazon is unique among streamers. It’s part of a larger set of features that come bundled with an Amazon Prime subscription — free shipping, music streaming, etc. Video content is the only reason to subscribe to Netflix; consumers have multiple rationales for paying their annual Amazon Prime fee. And as Bezos himself noted in June 2016, Amazon judges a show’s financial value differently than other premium services. “We get to monetize in a very unusual way,” the mogul said at Vox’s Code Conference. “When we win a Golden Globe, it helps us sell more shoes. And it does that in a very direct way. Because if you look at Prime members, they buy more on Amazon than non-Prime members … they look across more categories — they shop more. A lot of their behaviors change in ways that are very attractive to us as a business. And the customers utilize more of our services.”\n\nNone of this means Bezos can’t also want Amazon Prime Video programming to appeal to more subscribers (both current and potential) or win more Emmy and Golden Globe awards than it did this year. So when it came time to decide Price’s fate, Bezos almost surely had in mind the contents of that Wall Street Journal exposé on Amazon Studios. That article didn’t move the needle much on the sexual-harassment charges, but did include on-the-record quotes from top-name producers such as David E. Kelley, slamming the company’s treatment of producers. The story also raised questions about Amazon Studios’ decision-making process under Price, including allegations of favoritism toward writers who had romantic relationships with company executives.\n\nParticularly since the Journal story and the Price resignation, it’s not hard to find folks in Hollywood willing to offer up a disparaging off-the-record broadside against the way Amazon does business. They point to the fact that, more than once, it’s officially renewed shows only to rescind said renewals, leaving those involved in the project more embarrassed than if they’d simply had their shows canceled from the start. There’s the astonishing speed with which Amazon killed writer Dana Calvo’s Good Girls Revolt, pulling the plug on the period drama about, ironically, sexual harassment within six weeks of its premiere. Networks kill good shows all the time, and it’s not unusual for such decisions to be made based on little more than a whim. But the way Amazon handled Good Girls left even jaded Hollywood veterans slack-jawed. Executives at outside studios who’ve supplied shows to Amazon have similar horror stories about what they described as arrogance and, at times, even incompetence on the part of in-house marketing and PR executives tasked with promoting the company’s TV shows.\n\nPrice’s unceremonious departure from Amazon doesn’t prove Bezos shares any of these concerns, of course. The only thing it does demonstrate is that Bezos didn’t think Price was indispensable. “He simply wasn’t worth Jeff Bezos risking his entire Hollywood investment for,” as one top agent told Vulture this week. What Bezos does within the next three to six months will offer a better sense of how much change he thinks his TV unit needs.\n\nStill to be decided is the fate of Joe Lewis, Price’s top deputy, and the man with day-to-day control over drama and comedy development. Lewis was hired by Price, and the two worked as a team in recent months, following the promotion of Lewis from comedy chief to head of all programming (and VR content). He was dinged in the Wall Street Journal story, with the paper suggesting actress Yara Martinez — Lewis’s girlfriend — may have been cast in Amazon series such as The Tick and I Love Dick because of her relationship with Lewis. (Lewis didn’t respond to the Journal’s request for comment, nor did a rep for Martinez. The Journal quoted Tick showrunner Ben Edlund denying any pressure was exerted by Lewis.) Vulture has reached out to Amazon PR three times this week, most recently Thursday, with questions about Price’s departure and the future of the company. We also contacted Lewis directly. Neither Amazon PR nor Lewis replied to us.\n\nIt’s important to note that, for all the recent reports about dysfunction at the streamer, not all producers have been unhappy with how Amazon runs its TV business. Transparent creator Jill Soloway has spoken highly about the creative freedom the company has given her. Amazon under Price and Lewis also had no problem recruiting top talent for upcoming projects, including Matthew Weiner, Julia Roberts, Maya Rudolph, and Oscar-winning director Barry Jenkins. Similarly, it seems unfair to slam Amazon for not having found a “breakout” hit while at the same time criticizing it for making big bets on creative talent. It’s not that news outlets (and unnamed Hollywood sources) are wrong to raise questions about the financial wisdom of Amazon and Price/Lewis investing tens of millions in the poorly reviewed Woody Allen comedy series or the now-dead David O. Russell drama that was to have starred Robert De Niro and Julianne Moore. But these misfires, grand as they may be, are not unusual in Hollywood. HBO sunk tens of millions into Vinyl, while Netflix probably could’ve funded the government of a small country with the money it spent on the one-and-done Baz Luhrmann musical drama The Get Down.\n\nMissteps aside, there’s an argument to be made that Amazon’s overall creative track record these past five years isn’t dramatically worse than many other outlets deemed “successful.” Much is made of the fact that Hulu took home the drama series Emmy for The Handmaid’s Tale last month. But Transparent put Amazon on the awards map years ago. And with shows such as One Mississippi, Mozart in the Jungle, Man in the High Castle, and Sneaky Pete, Amazon has at least as many mid-level “buzz” shows as Hulu. The streamer clearly isn’t in the same galaxy as Netflix or HBO when it comes to launching Zeitgeist-ready shows, but Bezos has made it clear Netflix isn’t really his competition. What Bezos needs to decide now is whether Price’s departure alone addresses the legitimate concerns over how Amazon Studios has been managed and how it interacts with the creative community, including its own employees and talent. If it doesn’t, a more radical restructuring seems inevitable.",

As part of iOS 7’s dramatic interface changes, the Home screen icons have been slightly enlarged compared to the iOS 6 icons.\n\nFor example, as shown in the image above, the non-iOS 7-optimized Netflix icon has a small white border compared to Apple’s icons.\n\nIn order to avoid this interface issue, developers will need to include larger icons in their applications. iOS 6 icons on the iPhone come in at 114 x 114 pixel resolutions, while iOS 7 icons are slightly larger at 120 x 120 pixel resolutions. For the iPad, iOS 6 icons are at resolutions of 144 x 144, and on iOS 7 they come in at a resolution of 152 x 152:\n\nInvalid Image – For iOS applications, icons included in the binary submission must be in the PNG format.

Since the submitted app is an iOS 6 app, it appears that the new icon sizes listed in the email were provided in error. Nonetheless, the mistake seems to indicate that Apple is ramping up its preparations for iOS 7’s debut. Apple will certainly make the new icon sizes are requirement when it opens up iOS 7 app submissions.\n\nIn addition, the corner radius of iOS 7 icons have changed.

But make no mistake, the websites contain ads, not news articles.\n\nOne of the sites titled “Augusta Update” takes aim at Rep. John Barrow, a Georgia Democrat who is considered vulnerable in his race. An article on the page criticizes Barrow for voting against repealing the Affordable Care Act and working “hand-in-hand” with President Obama. And while the ad quotes actual news outlets, the only mention of sponsorship comes at the bottom of the page.\n\nBarrow is running against businessman Rick Allen for a sixth term representing Georgia’s 12th congressional district.\n\nThe NRCC came under scrutiny earlier this year for websites that appeared to support Democratic candidates, but actually sent donor dollars to the NRCC. Officials eventually edited the sites to make them more transparent. Some of the sites, including NancyPelosi2014.com, are still operating, but if a user wants to donate, the donor page now makes it clear that the money will go toward helping Republicans.\n\nAs for the latest set of ads, NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek told msnbc, “This is an effective way to disseminate information to voters who are particularly interested in learning the truth about these Democratic candidates.”\n\nThe NRCC confirms there are two dozen active landing pages attacking Democratic candidates. Another page, “Central Valley Update” targets California House candidate Amanda Renteria, who has been labeled a “carpetbagger” by opponents. Others in the NRCC’s cross-hairs includee Ann Callis in Illinois, Nick Casey in West Virginia, and Sean Eldridge in New York.\n\n“Democrats and the [Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee] are actively trying to have their candidates not talk to reporters and not do public appearances and they’re trying to hide their reckless agendas and voters deserve the facts,” Bozek said.\n\nAll the NRCC’s pages so far are designed to take swipes at Democratic candidates. They do not explicitly endorse any specific Republican candidates. The NRCC confirms they’ve been “highly effective,” but Democrats call the pages misleading. And while it remains unclear whether the NRCC intends to post more fake news sites, the the group’s Democratic counterpart says web-surfers should beware:\n\n“House Republicans’ campaign strategy to overcome their own historic unpopularity is to resort to deception – again,” Josh Schwerin, national press secretary for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, told msnbc.\n\nSchwerin also dismissed Bozek’s assertion that Democrats are avoiding the press.\n\n“While House Republicans are focused on fake news, Democrats will be highlighting the real Republican record of siding with their special interest-backers over the middle class.”",

  "latent_17261": "Mothers are indispensable to society and the church, showing the world what it means to generously give oneself for others, to respect life and to display tenderness and moral strength even in times of trouble, Pope Francis said.\n\nSpeaking to some 4,000 people gathered indoors for his general audience today, the Pope continued his series of talks about the family, but also gave a second talk about beauty and harmony when he thanked a group of circus performers at the end of the audience.\n\nTying the theme of the family to the church’s celebration of the feast of Mary, Mother of God,on New Year’s Day and the Epiphany on January 6, the Pope looked specifically at Mary’s role in the Gospel accounts of Christmas.\n\n“She gives us Jesus, she shows us Jesus, she lets us see Jesus,” the Pope said.\n\nEven though mothers are often “exalted” with praise and poetry, he said, they often get very little concrete help and appreciation. In fact, he said, “the willingness of mothers to sacrifice themselves for their children is often taken advantage of in order to ‘save’ on social spending.”\n\n“One should better understand their daily struggle to be efficient at work and attentive and loving in their family; it is necessary to better understand what they are striving for in order to express the best and most authentic fruits of their liberation,” he said.\n\nPope Francis recalled his own upbringing as one of five children, and spoke of how much work and how many problems, but also how much happiness, come with motherhood.\n\n“Mothers are the strongest antidote to the spread of selfish individualism,” he said.\n\nA world without mothers would be “inhumane,” he said, “because mothers always know how to give witness — even in the worst of times — to tenderness, dedication and moral strength.”\n\n“Being a mother does not mean just bringing a child into the world, but it is also a life choice. What does a mother choose?” he asked. “It is the choice to give life and this is great, this is beautiful.”\n\nIf societies do not do justice to the contributions and sacrifices of mothers, the church is not always better, he said. “Perhaps mothers, who are ready to make many sacrifices for their children and often also for others” should find greater reception and attention in the church, he said.\n\nIt is often the mother who passes on “the deepest sense of religious practice” as she plants and cultivates the seed of faith in a child by sharing prayers and devotional practices, he said. “Without mothers, not only would there be no new people of faith, but the faith would lose a good portion of its simple and profound warmth.”\n\nMothers are the biggest enemies of war, “which kills their children,” he said, admitting he has thought many times of those women who receive the dreaded letter notifying them of the loss of their children in their defense of the nation. “Poor women. How much a mother suffers,” he said solemnly.\n\nMothers are martyrs, the Pope said quoting a homily by Salvadoran Archbishop Oscar Romero, who was shot and killed in 1980 as he celebrated Mass.\n\nPresiding over the funeral Mass of a priest who had been assassinated by the country’s death squads, the late archbishop had said that giving one’s life does not just mean being killed for the faith, it is also offering oneself “in that silence of daily life,” bit by bit, “like a mother, who, without fear and with the simplicity of maternal martyrdom, conceives a child in her womb, brings it into the world, nurses it, raises it and lovingly cares” for the child.\n\nAt the end of his audience talk, the Pope was treated to a short circus show as acrobats and jugglers performed in front of him on stage while a jazz band played “All of Me.”\n\nThe Pope thanked the men, women and children taking part in an international festival in Rome for circus performers and praised them for being “creators of harmony, creators of beauty, who teach the high road of beauty,” which is “good for the soul.”\n\nBut while people today are well-practiced in “the language of the mind, thinking” and “the language of the hands, doing,” they need to remember to use “the language of the heart, loving,” he said.\n\n“These three languages come together to make up the harmony of the person; and there is the beauty,” he said.\n\nGod is not only truth, goodness and the master of creation, he is also beauty and “so many times we forget about beauty,” the Pope said. “Humanity thinks, hears, does, but today it is in such need of beauty.”\n\nIn a brief address to German and Polish-speaking groups attending the audience, the pope also greeted a delegation of people who survived the Auschwitz concentration camp and were freed 70 years ago in January.",
  "latent_17300": "Marriage equality is one of the key social and legal issues of our time. I’d like to offer a Buddhist perspective.\n\nAs with so many ethical and social questions, especially those that involve sexuality, we find that religion wants to be at the core of things. The conservative Christian churches are leading the opposition to marriage equality. We can’t generalise on the basis of religion, though. Many Christians believe that Christ’s message of compassion and love, and the fact that he never made any statement on homosexuality, provide a basis for support of marriage equality.\n\nIn Australia there was an interesting exchange between the highly conservative Catholic leader Cardinal George Pell and the group Australian Marriage Equality. The AME asked to meet Cardinal Pell, and he consented to do so as long as the AME agreed that not all opposition to same-sex marriage was a result of homophobia or discrimination. The AME agreed, and came out with the following statement:\n\n‘Just as we acknowledge that it is possible to oppose marriage equality without hating homosexuals, so we ask those who differ with us on this important issue to acknowledge that it is possible to support marriage equality without seeking to undermine, marriage, family, or religion.’\n\nThat’s a great starting point, and an all-too-rare example of dialogue as it should be.\n\nBut what of Buddhism? As with any issue, you’ll find a variety of positions; and as with any issue – and I apologise if this sounds cynical – most of those positions have little to do with anything the Buddha himself said or did.\n\nIn some cases we find Buddhist leaders who state the ethical case plainly. Ajahn Brahm has been very forward in supporting the gay community for many years, both in Australia and overseas. Master Hsin Yun, the leader of the international Fo Guang Shan order, said:\n\n‘People often ask me what I think about homosexuality. They wonder, is it right, is it wrong? The answer is, it is neither right nor wrong. It is just something that people do. If people are not harming each other, their private lives are their own business; we should be tolerant of them and not reject them.’\n\nOn the other hand, the Dalai Lama has repeatedly maintained that homosexual acts are a violation against the precepts. At the same time, he insists on compassion and full human rights for all. His stance is solely concerned with what is appropriate behaviour for a Buddhist practitioner, not what should be made law.\n\nHis argument is that the sexual organs are designed for procreation and should be used solely for that purpose. So any form of sex that is not for procreation is out.\n\nThis is, to my mind, an extreme and unrealistic position. The Dalai Lama says it is based on certain medieval Indian scholars (Vasubandhu, Asanga – but I have never seen the passages myself). It certainly has no basis in the Suttas. On the contrary, the Suttas freely acknowledge that sex is for pleasure, and they never make a problem out of that. Buddhism is not a fertility religion, so why we should insist that sex be for procreation is beyond me.\n\nThe precept as found in the early Buddhist texts mentions nothing about whether sex is for procreation or not. What it talks about, solely, is whether the sexual relation involves the betrayal of a social contract. Here’s the text. It’s a stock passage, found for example in Majjhima Nikaya 41, and Anguttara Nikaya 10.176 and 10.211:\n\n‘One is a person who misconducts himself in sexual pleasures. One has intercourse with a woman who is protected by mother, father, mother and father, brother, sister, family, clan, law (or custom, ‘dhamma’), or one who has a husband, who is punishable, or even with one garlanded for betrothal.’ ‘Kāmesu micchācārī hoti, yā tā māturakkhitā piturakkhitā mātāpiturakkhitā bhāturakkhitā bhaginirakkhitā ñātirakkhitā gottarakkhitā dhammarakkhitā sasāmikā saparidaṇḍā antamaso mālāguḷaparikkhittāpi, tathārūpāsu cārittaṃ āpajjitā hoti.’\n\nMost of these are straightforward. They refer to women who are not ‘independent’ women in our modern sense, but who live under the authority of others. Typically, of course, this would have been young girls living at home, then in a family with a husband. There are significant variations, though, so arrangements were flexible.\n\nIt’s noteworthy that, while the Hindu texts say that a woman must always be under the authority of a man, here we find that living under the authority of a mother is next to father, and a sister is next to brother, with no implication that one of the other is preferable.\n\nIn some cases, it seems, women lived under the protection of the wider family. The one ‘guarded by dhamma’ is probably adopted, orphaned, or in some other way taken care of. The one who is ‘punishable’ is ambiguous: does it mean that the woman is to be punished (as a criminal)? Or does it mean that having intercourse with her is punishable? The text doesn’t make it clear. The woman ‘garlanded for betrothal’ refers to a woman who is, in our modern sense, ‘engaged’ but not yet married.\n\nObviously, the passage as stated above only refers to the man as agent. That doesn’t mean that women can’t break this precept! Like so many of the Buddhist texts, it is phrased from a male point of view (andocentric), and would apply equally to both genders. The assumption of the passage is that it is women who are under protection. This reflects the social reality of the Buddha’s time; it doesn’t endorse this situation, nor does it say that women can’t or shouldn’t live independently. It just says that if a woman (and presumably a man) is living in a committed relationship then one should not betray that.\n\nThis much is clear: the precept against sexual misconduct has nothing to do with homosexuality (or any other form of sexual activity as such.) It is concerned with breaking the bonds of trust with those that we love, and nothing else. While the specifics of the social relations in the Buddha’s time are different than today, it is not problematic to work out how to apply this in our own context, at least in most cases.\n\nSo if the precept does not concern homosexuality, what did the Buddha say on the topic? We are very lucky in Buddhism to have thousands of discourses, with the Buddha making observations or criticisms regarding many kinds of ethical issues. Rape, paedophilia, adultery: these and many other problems are clearly mentioned in the early texts, and the Buddha made it clear that he didn’t approve of them.\n\nIn the case of homosexuality, however, we have nothing in the Suttas. In all the thousands of discourses, not a single one regarded homosexuality as a significant issue.\n\nThere is one passage in the Cakkavattisihanada Sutta, which is sometimes cited by those who are trying to prove that the Buddha was anti-gay. The text discusses various examples of moral decay in society. One of the practices it mentions is, in the Pali, micchā-dhamma. This is about the most generic term for wrong doing that it’s possible to make in Pali. You could translate it as ‘wrong teachings’, ‘bad practices’, ‘misguided actions’, and so on. The commentary, compiled nearly 1000 years later in Sri Lanka, however, says it means, ‘Lustful desire of men for men, and women for women.’ (Micchādhammoti purisānaṃ purisesu itthīnañca itthīsu chandarāgo.) Since this has no basis in the text, it stands as a record of the attitude of a medieval commentator. There’s no evidence, so far as I am aware, that this attitude was representative of ancient Theravadin or Sri Lankan culture in general.\n\nThe Suttas essentially ignore any issues around homosexuality. Now, arguments from absence are always difficult. But the presence of thousands of discourses detailing lists of many kinds of ethical violations, strongly suggests that the Buddha tried to be reasonably comprehensive in addressing ethical concerns, and homosexuality was not one of them.\n\nThe picture in the Vinaya is a little different. The Vinaya is a legal code for monastics, and since it regulates the conduct of a celibate order, it deals with all kinds of possible sexual behaviours. It does so with a degree of frankness and candour that so shocked the early European translators that they simply omitted large chunks of text, or, with a quaint regard for the delicate sensibilities of young readers, translated them into Latin.\n\nHomosexual acts, like just about any other imaginable sexual act, are depicted many times in the Vinaya, both among monks and nuns. In each case, the Buddha is shown as responding in his usual direct and common sense manner. Obviously, homosexual behaviour, like any sexual behaviour, is inappropriate among the celibate monastic community, so the Buddha prohibits it. However, this is done in a straight, matter-of-fact tone, and there is never a suggestion that there is anything wrong with gay sex per se.\n\nIn several cases the penalty is actually less in the case of homosexual behaviour. For example, for a monk to erotically touch another man is a less serious offence than the same act with a woman. Sex between women, likewise, is treated less seriously than between a woman and a man. There is one passage where the Buddha’s chief disciple, Venerable Sariputta, is said to have had two novices as students. But they had sex with each other. The Buddha laid down a rule that one should not take two novices as students at the same time! (This rule, like many others, was later relaxed.)\n\nHowever, it would be a mistake to read this as implying that the Buddha regarded same-sex sexuality as somehow more permissible in the Sangha. The Vinaya, as a legal code, frequently makes judgements for various technical reasons, and there is no strong correlation between the moral weight of an act and the severity with which it is treated in the Vinaya. For example, building an overly-large hut is a serious offence, while bashing someone within an inch of their life is a minor offence.\n\nSo we shouldn’t read too much into the relative leniency of how some homosexual acts are treated in the Vinaya. The main point is simply that homosexuality is treated in pretty much the same way as any other expression of sexuality.\n\nIn these accounts there is nothing that really corresponds with our modern notion of sexual orientation. For the most part, same-sex acts are just that, acts. There’s no idea of a person who solely or primarily is attracted to people of the same sex.\n\nThe texts do speak of a certain kind of person, called a paṇḍaka. These are typically male, but there were females too (itthīpaṇḍikā). A paṇḍaka is forbidden to ordain, and is regularly associated with unbridled sexuality. It is, however, unclear exactly what paṇḍaka means. The descriptions of the paṇḍaka are few, and not always consistent, but there seems to have been some physical attribute involved, as well as a set of cultural behaviours. Perhaps they were some form of eunuchs who performed sexual services. In any case, the paṇḍaka is clearly not a homosexual in the modern sense of the word. They may be connected with the modern classes of Hijras and the like, who are considered a ‘third sex’ in India, including transsexuals, hermaphrodites, and eunuchs.\n\nTo sum up, early Buddhism is well aware of homosexual acts, and never treats them as an ethical problem. Homosexuality as a sexual orientation is not found.\n\nThis is completely in line with the Buddha’s take on ethics. The Buddha did not ethically judge persons, he judged deeds. People are simply people, who do various kinds of things, some good, some bad. If a person does a deed that causes harm, this is what the Buddha considered ‘unskilful’. If the deed causes no harm, it is not unskilful.\n\nThe basic problem in sexual ethics, addressed in the third precept, is betrayal. ‘Sexual misconduct’ is sexual behaviour that causes harm by breaking the trust that a loved one has placed in us. The Buddha was compassionate, and he never laid down ethical rules that caused harm or distress. Making a moral proscription against homosexuality marginalises and harms people who have done no wrong, and it is against the basic principles of Buddhist ethics.\n\nIt’s so important to keep this essential ethical question in mind. In discussions on homosexuality, as with just about any other controversial ethical issue, there is a pervasive tendency to confuse the issue. Why do we find it so difficult to look at an ethical question rationally? It is true, there are some issues that are complex and the details can be difficult to work out. But this is not one of them.\n\nCountless times we are told, for example, that homosexuality is ‘unnatural’. Surely a moment’s reflection should show us this is not true, because there’s plenty of homosexuality in the animal world. And anyway, how is gay sex more unnatural than, say, typing on a keyboard, or wrapping food in plastic? But this is all beside the point. Being ‘unnatural’ is not an ethical issue. The issue is whether it causes harm, not whether it is natural or not. That is no more an ethical issue than is the choice, say, to eat organic or non-organic vegetables.\n\nHomosexuality is also regularly linked with sexual ‘decadence’ in general. Homosexuals are said to be paedophiles, or promiscuous, or to cause diseases such as AIDS. Allowing homosexual relations is to licence all manner of debaucheries. This objection, too, is not valid: gays behave in all sorts of ways, just as do straight people.\n\nBlaming gays for AIDS is one of the most cruel arguments possible. We feel compelled to look for examples that show the absurdity of these views. What of babies born with AIDS? What of those who get AIDS via blood transfusion? Incidence of malaria is much greater among poor people – are we to blame them, too? And why is incidence of AIDS among lesbians so very low – is lesbianism kammically preferable?\n\nBut we shouldn’t have to look for such examples. Like the arguments mentioned above, the whole thing is missing the point. Take the ‘worst case’ scenario, the cliché of the promiscuous, irresponsible, drug-taking, careless gay man. We might not think his behaviour is praiseworthy or wise, but does it deserve a slow, lingering, and painful death? Are we really comfortable to righteously proclaim the justice of destroying a human life, because we think that the way they have sought pleasure is irresponsible? This whole argument is inhuman and unworthy.\n\nIf there are behaviours that gay people do that increase transmission of HIV, for example, then we can try to change those behaviours, just as we would try to help any people who were inadvertently causing harm. What the marriage equality movement wants is to enable people of various sexual orientations to live in an accepted, recognised, and legal framework which supports the development of loving, committed relationships. Banning gay marriage is the very best way to ensure gays remain marginalised.\n\nAnother red herring, in my view, is the ‘born this way’ argument, which is often used by those who support marriage equality. Homosexuality, so the argument goes, is not a choice, some people are just like that and can’t change. While this is an important, if contested, fact, it misses the ethical issue. What if some gay people don’t feel like they were ‘born this way’? What if they feel like they have made a conscious choice? Whether this is the case or not, or whether there are in fact hidden biological factors involved, so what? Having sex with someone of the same gender is not a harmful deed, nor is marrying someone of the same gender. Whether it’s by biological determinism or free will, nothing harmful is done, so there’s no ethical problem.\n\nPerhaps the single most fallacious argument against gay marriage is simply that it upsets the customs of society. Marriage has always been between a man and a woman, therefore it will damage society to do it any other way.\n\nThis argument, favoured by conservatives, once again completely misses the point. The damage is already here. Violence, trauma, and abuse is a part of the living reality of millions of perfectly good people all over the world, simply because the have, or want to have, sex with persons of their own gender. Part of society is broken, and it needs fixing.\n\nThis is the same argument that was used to oppose abolishing slavery, votes for women, property rights for all, and so on. In each case, those in the position of privilege strive to keep others from getting the same rights. And since the cost of inequality is borne by the ‘others’, it does not exist for the privileged.\n\nWhen we introduce compassion into the equation, however, we recognise that society has always been imperfect. Just because something was done in the past does not make it right. Perhaps it was the case that in certain times and places our marriage customs made more sense than they do now. But that’s not the point. The point is, what is the right thing to do now? To continue to exclude, marginalise, and discriminate? Or to broaden our moral horizons, to fully accept and include all people?\n\nIf homosexuality as such is not a problem, what then of same-sex marriages? In this area we find that the Buddha had even less to say. In fact, there is no such thing as a Buddhist marriage. Buddhists have simply adopted the marriage customs of the culture they find themselves in. The most basic model, therefore, was the customs of ancient India. These have been the basis for Buddhist family customs, adapted in each society that Buddhism has gone to.\n\nIn ancient India, there were several forms of marriage. As with all things Indian, there is no insistence on one true, correct way of doing things. Some Hindu texts list a whole range of marriage possibilities, which are correlated with the levels of Indian cosmology. The highest form of marriage is the ‘Brahma wedding’, where the bride and groom, each pure in lineage and caste, is united in the most perfect of ceremonies. If the marriage is lacking in some perfections of detail, it is reckoned as pertaining to the lower classes of deities. The lowest of the auspicious weddings is the gandharva wedding, where the bride and groom simply elope. Then there are the various inauspicious unions, those of the yakkhas or rakkhasas, where, for example, the woman is abducted by force.\n\nAlong with this diversity in wedding style, there were different marital arrangements. Monogamy seems to have been common, and of course these were often arranged marriages – but ancient Buddhist texts also record a strong struggle by women for autonomy in the marriage choices. Polygamy is also common, and was the norm for kings. Polyandry is less common, but is central to the most famous of all Hindu texts, the Mahabharata. Apparently polyandry is common in Tibet.\n\nI’m not trying to uphold the Indian marriage system as superior to that in the West. It has its own problems with inter-caste marriages, arranged marriages, domestic violence, and so on. I’m merely making the point that there has traditionally been an adaptive diversity of living arrangements that were considered to be valid forms of marriage, and that this can be seen in some ways as a precedent for the modern idea of same-sex marriages.\n\nSo there has always been a flexibility and diversity in marriage customs in the Indian sphere that stands in clear contrast with the ‘one and only’ correct form of marriage that is, in the main, endorsed by the contemporary monotheistic religions. Same-sex marriages were not, so far as I’m aware, historically acknowledged within the Indian cultural sphere. Nor am I aware of any laws against them, such as we find in the modern day. Given the wide variations in marriage customs, including many forms of marriage that would not be considered valid in modern times, it would seem that the typical Indian approach was that of tolerance and inclusion. Accordingly, when the British law that made gay sex a crime was repealed in India in 2009, some Hindu authorities applauded the move, saying homosexuality was part of the divine order.\n\nUnfortunately, this tolerant attitude is not always the case today. One sometimes finds Hindutva polemics against homosexuality. Such discourse, sadly enough, often rails against the supposed debauched influence of ‘Western’ morals, oblivious to the fact that anti-gay attitudes were themselves imported into India by the monotheistic religions. This ambiguity has been expressed by the highest authorities in India. Goolam Vahanvati, then solicitor-general and current attorney-general, stated to the UN Human Rights Council:\n\n‘Around the early 19th Century, you probably know that in England they frowned on homosexuality, and therefore there are historical reports that various people came to India to take advantage of its more liberal atmosphere with regard to different kinds of sexual conduct. ‘As a result, in 1860 when we got the Indian Penal Code, which was drafted by Lord Macaulay, they inserted Section 377 which brought in the concept of “sexual offences against the order of nature”. ‘Now in India we didn’t have this concept of something being “against the order of nature”. It was essentially a Western concept, which has remained over the years. Now homosexuality as such is not defined in the IPC, and it will be a matter of great argument whether it is “against the order of nature”.’\n\nA similar situation prevails in other Buddhist countries, too. In Japan, China, and elsewhere, the early generations of Christian missionaries were shocked at the casual acceptance of homosexual behaviour among the Buddhists. They immediately set about trying to persuade the world that their own version of sexual propriety was the right one for everyone.\n\nSadly enough, modern generations of Buddhists and Hindus are now doing this work for them, oblivious to their own more accepting and compassionate past. When a Thai monk like Thattajiwo, one of the leaders of Dhammakaya, rails against the ‘sexual perverts’, who have called down the kammic justice of AIDS (‘the executioner of the sex-mad’) upon them, oblivious of the pit of sin they have fallen into, and the even greater sufferings that await them in future disease-ridden hells of torment, he is merely parroting the frothing excesses of Christian and Islamic fundamentalists. (Phra Thattajiwo Bhikku. Waksiin Porng-kan Rook Eet (A Vaccine to Protect Against AIDS). Pathumthani: Thammakay Foundation.) Such apocalyptic and condemnatory ‘ethics’ have no basis in the Buddha’s teaching.\n\nSo in today’s climate, what are we to do? For the Buddha, homosexuality was clearly not an issue. Nor was making laws proscribing valid forms of marriage. What was an issue, on the other hand, was compassion. The very essence of compassion is to reach out to those who are suffering, those who are marginalised. and persecuted. People whose sexual orientation varies from the majority suffer discrimination, bullying at school, violence, and emotional trauma. As Buddhists we should recognise a clear moral imperative to help wherever we can.\n\nOne might object that since the Buddha made no statement on the legalities of gay marriage, we should do the same. But the problem is a little more subtle than that. We are living in a culture where, based on certain religious and cultural ideas, certain ways of living one’s life have been made illegal. This is an artefact of the conditioned and always arbitrary course of history, not a timeless feature of the human landscape. In Australia, for example, there was no clear Federal law that prohibited same-sex marriage until 2004.\n\nSupporting marriage equality is not to introduce something new, but simply to abolish laws that discriminate. The injustice is already in place. The harm is being done. The change is merely to remove the harmful influence of discriminatory laws, which should never have been there in the first place.\n\nPeople are people, regardless of their gender, colour, nationality, or sexual orientation. The Buddha taught ‘for one who feels’. That’s the only requirement for Buddhist practice: one who feels. In the past our society decreed that marriage should not be between people of a different race, or a different colour, or a different religion, or a different nationality. Over time, we decided that these rules were harmful, and we abolished them.\n\nCatastrophes were predicted: they didn’t come true.\n\nWhat has happened, rather, is that we have become a little more open minded, and a little more aware of the suffering of others. The test of our generation is whether we can continue this move towards a more accepting and loving way of living, or whether we are to regress to a meaner, hard-hearted place.\n\nMy society, my culture, the one that I’m proud of and want to belong to, is this one. The society that is kind, questioning, accepting. Let us take up the best aspects of our own cultures, whether they be Buddhist or modern cultures, and discard all that is unjust, discriminatory, and harmful. Let us give our full support for marriage equality, for if we do not we are betraying the best part of our humanity.\n\nAdvertisements",
  "latent_17332": "I had long given up Richard Prince for dead. Once a heroic and radical appropriation artist—one who granted a wellspring of permissions to the current crop of conceptual writers—over the years had morphed into a bloated, expression-based painter, churning out multimillion dollar canvases for a ravenous wealthy collectorship. His 2007 Guggenheim retrospective seemed little more than an opportunistic occasion to ratchet up the value of his already overvalued works. In fact, a year after the show, one of his Nurse paintings sold for a record $8.4 million. Clearly, Prince had moved into some other realm, one in which I, and others of my ilk, had little stake or interest in.\n\nBut then a strange thing happened. A few months ago, a friend pulled off her bookshelf a new appropriation work by Richard Prince, one so radical and so daring, that I almost couldn't believe it was by the same artist. The premise of the book was achingly simple: a reproduction of the first edition of The Catcher In The Rye, identical in every way except the author's name was swapped from J.D. Salinger to Richard Prince. The production value of the book was astonishingly high, a perfect facsimile of the original, right down to the thick, creamy paper stock and classic typeface. The text on the dust jacket—replete with the same iconic line drawing of the angry red horse—began, \"Anyone who has read Richard Prince's New Yorker stories, particularly A Perfect Day for Bananafish, Uncle Wiggly in Connecticut, The Laughing Man, and For Esmé--with Love and Squalor, will not be surprised by the fact that his first novel is full of children.\" It was a dead-ringer through and through —not a word was changed—with the exception that the following disclaimer was added to the colophon page: \"This is an artwork by Richard Prince. Any similarity to a book is coincidental and not intended by the artist.\" Most shockingly, the colophon concluded with: © Richard Prince.\n\nJames Frey (center) and Richard Prince (dark jacket) selling books outside Central Park, 2011.\n\nFor a Richard Prince edition, the book was modestly priced: a few hundred bucks for a limited unsigned edition, with the signed copy selling for several thousand, matching the identical price of what the signed first edition by Salinger goes for today. Remarkably one day last fall, Prince took a bunch of copies of his pirated edition, spread them out on a blanket on sidewalk in front of Central Park, and sold them for $40 each. It's unknown how many—if any—he sold or how a presumably befuddled public might have responded to this performance.\n\nIt's a terribly ballsy move. Price is openly pirating what is arguably the most valuable literary property American literature, practically begging the estate of Salinger to sue him. After his recent protracted lawsuit and subsequent ruling against him for his appropriated use of images from his Canal Zone series—where he \"creatively transformed\" photographs of Rastafarians from an in-print book into paintings—you'd think that he'd shy away from such gestures. But no. Instead, he's back with what appears to be his strongest and purest work of appropriation in decades.\n\nWhile there are no clear answers as to why at this particular juncture Prince would choose to replicate The Catcher In the Rye, tremendous insights into Prince's thinking and processes can be found in a recent book, Canal Zone Richard Prince YES RASTA: The Book, published by Greg Allen, proprietor of the influential art blog greg.org. Allen's book collects nearly 400 pages of court documents from the Prince Canal Zone case, including depositions, affidavits, and court summaries. For anyone interested in the history of appropriation art, it is spellbinding and essential reading. In fact, this collection of documents might constitute the definitive book on appropriative practices in the arts, replete with lawyers citing in great narrative detail prior examples of theft and plunder involving everyone from Marcel Duchamp to Jeff Koons.\n\nThe meat of the book is several hundred pages of Prince's deposition. Allen claims that it constitutes the single important in-depth interview Richard Prince has ever done—and ever will do. And he's right: it's a compendium of exactly what makes Richard Prince tick, peppered with beautiful and well-articulated insights. Speaking about his 1983 book, Why I Go To The Movies Alone, Prince says, \"I think at the time I wrote it I was—I was very interested in anti-expressionism… And the idea of not liking your own work I thought was a kind of avant-garde, revolutionary, very poetic position to take at the time. Because most artists you meet have these large egos and love what they do. So I took the opposite point of view.\" It's a page right out of the conceptual writing playbook. Or when asked, \"If you create a work of art, anyone else who wants to is free to copy it and sell it?\" Prince, sounding like the most radical of free culture advocates answers, \"That's the optional or operative word you just said. Free.\" Under oath, Prince says that his works are not copyrighted and suggests that, should anyone care to plagiarize his works, he would encourage it.\n\nTellingly, the pivotal moment in the deposition comes when he is asked, \"You don't behave more cautiously now because you have more assets than you did in the 1970's?\" Prince simply answers, \"No.\" From that point on, Prince is grilled on his substantial assets: his mansion on Manhattan's Upper East Side which he purchased for $6.5 million, his many houses, the endless vacations to St. Barth's, the lucrative deals he's made with Louis Vuitton and Marc Jacobs, and so forth. And then there's the prices of the Canal Zone paintings, which sold for $2 million each. Or the fact that one of his appropriated \"Marlboro Men\" photographs from the 1970s, made when he was penniless, was sold in 2005 auction for $1.2 million. And suddenly, your stomach begins to turn. You start to wonder if all that countercultural rhetoric is just a way of avoiding having to pay an untold sum to the photographer from which he appropriated these images. It's complicated: While you want to support his artistic practice—there really is a sincere artist buried underneath all that cash—as the deposition winds on, he unwittingly casts himself as a stereotype of wealth he's become. You think, with all that cash, can't he just settle with this poor photographer, a guy whose book sales has netted him a mere $8,000? But then you think, no: Prince's tactics and uses of the images clearly fall under fair use. They are creatively transformative and are backed by three decades of sustained and important artistic practice. He shouldn't have to pay a cent.\n\nPrince's The Catcher In The Rye is no trifling gesture. It's a profound work of appropriation, but because Prince has money, he can afford to settle with the Salinger estate in ways that conceptual poets couldn't possibly imagine. If I, for instance, had appropriated Salinger, due to my meager financial and marginal cultural status, I'd probably be left alone; if Richard Prince appropriated a day's copy of The New York Times, as I did with my book Day, he'd be sued, whereas I was ignored. It's not hard to fathom the cultural economics at play: The Rasta photographer smelled big money around Prince and he'd have been crazy not to try to snag his share.\n\nNo artist should have to go through what Prince went through here, forced to reveal in detail his artistic process to bunch of philistines. It's a horrible grilling, one that sucks all the mystery out of his creative practice. It's hard to imagine Andy Warhol—with his monosyllabic responses and his legendary reluctance to speak at all—submitting to such a process. Had he done so, the mystique of Warhol would be much diminished today, which is the reason he wisely settled out of court when sued in a similar case. Clearly Warhol understood mystery's correlative value to legacy.\n\nAs a work of conceptual writing, Allen's book is squarely in line with the repurposed court documents of Vanessa Place and even bears a distant resemblance to Reznikoff's Testimony. Some great transcriptional moments occur in Allen's book, like when the lawyers are quoting from Prince's written works (where all punctuation has to be articulated, reminding us of Craig Dworkin's Parse) such as this passage from his essay \"Appropriation\" (1978):\n\nI think appropriation has to do with the inability of the author slash artist to like his or her own work, period. Especially if the work is all theirs, period. I think it's a lot more satisfying to appropriate, comma, especially if you are attempting to produce work with a certain believability, comma, an official fiction let's say. If you take someone else's work and call it your own, comma, you don't have to ask an audience, quote, to take my word for it, unquote, period. It's not like it started with you and ended up being guessed at. The effect you want to produce is not that different from what an audience sometimes experiences when viewing a good movie. And that's what -- and then in quotes -- somebody named Christian Metz called a general lowering of wakefulness.\n\nThis sort of linguistic hall of mirrors—lawyers appropriating Prince's writings on appropriation in thick, materialized English, bound into work of conceptual literature—makes the most compelling case for Allen's work as literature, whereby the construction and conceptualization of his document exactly reflects the complexities of its content. Hey, nobody ever said conceptualism was easy.",

Contributions to politicians in a strong position to put pressure on the SEC are more effective than others at reducing the probability of enforcement and penalties imposed by an enforcement action.

  "latent_17359": "Pinterest is having a difficult time growing its business internationally. Valued at $11 billion, the startup is one of the few prominent tech companies that was able to overcome the struggles of an unpredictable global economy. This accomplishment is impressive, considering that the business is only six years old. To cater to global markets, the startup opened offices in London, Paris, Berlin, Tokyo and São Paulo. Furthermore, the company has prolonged its highly anticipated IPO debut, and has instead set its sights on expansion. Below covers Pinterest’s plans to localize its offerings and the role that the Top translation companies will play during the transition.\n\nPinterest and Localization Problems\n\nTo date, the startup boasts over 100 million active users, most of which (85 percent) are female. Statistics from Digital Marketing Ramblings, a digital marketing firm, suggest that around 42 percent of women in the US use the social platform on a regular basis. The business has mastered the US market, but in other parts of the world, it is having difficulties overcoming local customs and cultures. “In a bid to attract Internet users worldwide, image-discovery site Pinterest Inc. has learned a few valuable lessons. Among them: The French don’t want to see the Americanized recipes of beloved classic dishes such as the cassoulet, but they aren’t averse to non-Parisian fashion,” said Yoree Koh from Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn the past few months, Pinterest has attempted to make the site less American. With a projected revenue of $3 billion by 2018, it plans to start targeting ads to foreign users. The company admitted that roughly 45 percent of its active customers are internationally based in countries outside of the US. Ideally, execs want the ratio to lean more towards 50 percent, in order to make the most out of their advertising revenue stream. By comparison, Facebook and Twitter have an estimated 80 percent of international users.\n\n“It says it has doubled international users in the past year to about 45 million. Despite the gains, the percentage of Pinterest users in Brazil, France, Germany and Japan remains in the single digits, according to people familiar with the matter,” wrote Koh.\n\nTop Translation Companies’ Role\n\nWhen it comes to languages, the website offers a general selection of translations, ranging from Dutch and Bahasa Indonesia, to Portuguese and Spanish. In order to ensure complete localization, Pinterest will have to update its images, menu selections and panels to meet the demands of its foreign demographics. It also needs help from top translation companies to create more accurate translations of the platform’s basic features .\n\nAn example of this is the brand’s move to switch the word “board” to “folder” for its users in Brazil. Ricardo Sangion, Pinterest’s country manager in Brazil, also explained that it may consider replacing the “pin it” feature with the word “save” to avoid confusion in the South American market. The changes signal a great start for the startup, but in order to compete directly with other social platforms, it needs a more thorough approach to translation and localization. An example of a business that has successfully met the needs of its foreign customers is PayPal.

I participated in the show on that belief.\n\n“But this programme has nothing to do with community, which you can tell from the title. It’s all about people in the street living off benefits, taking drugs and dossing around all day. It makes people out as complete scum.\n\n“They lied to us from the very beginning. We opened our doors and hearts to them and they violated us and abused our trust.”\n\nIn the opening sequence to the first episode Dee, 32, is seen walking along the street identifying houses where she believed the occupants were out of work and on benefits.\n\nShe said: “They have shown me pointing at houses shouting ‘unemployed, on benefits’, but they haven’t shown me pointing at the houses where I knew people were working and in jobs.\n\n\"I’m really worried about how my neighbours will react if they see it.\n\n“They have edited everything to suit their own needs – taken a positive and turned it into a negative.”\n\n(Image: Richard Swingler)\n\nDee, who is unemployed and on benefits, was approached to appear on the show at a jobseeker event in Birmingham.\n\nShe said around a dozen people were involved in the making of the show, filmed over a period of 12 months starting in early 2012.\n\nLocal resident Nikitta Bell, 24, was unemployed when camera crews began following her but is now working full-time as a beautician.\n\n“They recorded me making a phone call enquiring about a job vacancy even though I asked them not to,” she said.\n\n“A guy answered so I asked what the job involved.

Everyone on the street is fuming about it.\n\n\"Half of my family and friends have already disowned me because of it. Some want me to change my name on Deed Poll.\n\n‘‘We might be on benefits but everyone has got to start somewhere.’’\n\nMr Thomas added: “I’m on benefits at the moment but that’s because I’m training to be a security guard.

  "latent_17485": "June 17, 2015\n\nby Canadian Manufacturing.com Staff\n\nTORONTO—As thousands of students at colleges and universities across the province are set to graduate with five-figure debts, the Ontario Government is flying into action.\n\nThe Ontario Student Assistance Program (OSAP) and Toronto-based company Higher Ed Points will allow students to apply accumulated Aeroplan miles against the balance of their student loan. Student frequent flyers can now redeem their miles in $250 denominations and transfer the funds through www.HigherEdPoints.com to their Ontario Student Assistance Program student loan account.\n\n“The ability to use loyalty points to offset student loans is going to make a huge difference to students and graduates,” says Suzanne Tyson, Founder of Higher Ed Points. “Paying down those loans faster is great for them and the Canadian economy as a whole.”\n\nWhile Tyson is flying high with news of the announcement, Rajean Hoilett, chairperson of the Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario, was less impressed.\n\n“This latest announcement is yet another example of a government that treats Ontario’s student debt crisis like an episode of Extreme Couponing,” he said. “But there is nothing entertaining about the difficult choices today’s students and graduates must face to make ends meet.”\n\n“Students who must take on loans to finance their education in this province graduate with an average of $27,000 of debt to repay,” he added. “Ballooning student debt levels have a significant impact on the financial stability of new graduates entering the labour market, often delaying important life decisions such as opening a business, buying a home or starting a family.”\n\nHoilett thinks that if Ontario was truly dedicated to ensuring higher education is affordable to all Ontarians, it “wouldn’t turn an entire generation’s economic insecurity into a loyalty program.”\n\nThe Canadian Federation of Students-Ontario, the province’s oldest and largest student organization, has consistently called for the government to reinvest in public post-secondary education, to reduce tuition fees for all students and to introduce more needs-based, non-repayable grants to student financial assistance programs.",
  "latent_17486": "WASHINGTON ― It was a yes-or-no question that shouldn’t have been hard to answer: Is President Barack Obama a Christian?\n\nDonald Trump has fueled speculation that Obama might be Muslim since 2011, when he questioned whether the president was really born in Hawaii. Obama eventually released his birth certificate, but the GOP presidential nominee still refuses to disavow so-called “birthers.”\n\nStill, the absurd conspiracy theory seemed to be an old story ― one that has been debunked so many times and that Obama himself has made fun of. But several people The Huffington Post asked Friday about Obama’s faith at the annual Values Voter Summit, a conference for religious conservatives, showed that Trump has very much succeeded in raising questions about the president’s religion.\n\n“I do question it, I really do,” said Linda Roller, referring to Obama’s Christianity. “One of the latest things I saw was even a symbol with his hand that was similar to a Muslim saying Allah is the only God.”\n\nRoller went on to say that she didn’t think Obama was Christian because he didn’t share her beliefs.\n\n“I mean just the fact that he is very liberal and the fact that he believes in abortion for instance,” she said. “And that he believes in a lot things that I don’t believe in because I try to use the Bible as my guide.”\n\nSeveral people echoed Roller. Many believed that even though Obama said he was Christian, his actions, particularly support for pro-abortion rights and for Planned Parenthood, suggested otherwise.\n\n“He states he is, but we look at people by the fruit that they portray,” Heidi Pezdek said. “What I’m looking at is his stand for abortion and support for Planned Parenthood, which is murder, murder in the womb, and his strong support of the LGBT lifestyle community.”\n\nSAUL LOEB via Getty Images Several attendees at the Values Voter Summit said they don't think President Barack Obama is Christian.\n\nNancy Elliott said she didn’t believe he’s shown signs of Christianity. “He is so in the tank with Planned Parenthood that kills babies,” she said. “I don’t see the fruits of Christianity in him. He may be, I hope he is. I have no ill towards the man, but he doesn’t show the roots of a believer.” When asked whether she thought Obama was a Muslim, Elliott replied, “I don’t know. They say he was raised as a Muslim.”\n\nA CNN/ORC poll from last September showed that just 39 percent of Americans think Obama is a Christian. Twenty-nine percent of those surveyed said they think he is a Muslim.\n\n“I’m not too sure,” Values Voter Summit attendee Joseph Guagliardi said. “While he does claim to be a Christian, I’m not sure how you can be for abortion and be a Christian because as Christians we believe in pro-life.”\n\nJoe Tegerdine said actions were more important than stated beliefs when it came to Christianity.\n\n“If you look at somebody’s policies and the way they behave and the way they act, it speaks more about your Christianity than what you say. So I take what Obama says literally at face value, but I take what he does to heart,” he said. “I think he’s proven through his behavior that he may not be as Christian as he may claim.”\n\nObama has spoken extensively about his Christian faith on several occasions.\n\n“For me, and I know for so many of you, faith is the great cure for fear,” he said at the National Prayer Breakfast this year. “Jesus is a good cure for fear. God gives believers the power, the love, the sound mind required to conquer any fear.”\n\nThe president said in 2006 that an attack suggesting he wasn’t a “true Christian” during his race for a U.S. Senate seat in Illinois “nagged” at him. Obama has said that while he was not raised in a particularly religious household, he found the power of Christianity while working as a community organizer on the South Side of Chicago.\n\n“Without a vessel for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone,” he said in 2006. “It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn’t fall out in church. The questions I had didn’t magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God’s spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.”\n\nObama left his church, Chicago’s Trinity United Church of Christ, in 2008 after comments of his pastor, Rev. Jeremiah Wright, criticizing the United States emerged.\n\nDespite Obama’s references to his faith, Tristen Jimenez said he still hadn’t seen enough evidence that the president is a Christian.\n\n“I don’t know enough facts to answer that yes or no, there’s a lot of public, media stuff that says he’s not. At the end of the day, I don’t know,” Jimenez said. “I want to say [he is] just because he is our president and you want to have trust and faith in that, but you know, I don’t know his heart; I don’t know what’s in his head.” Asked whether Obama is Muslim, Jimenez said “he could be anything.”\n\nWhile attendees at the Values Voter Summit didn’t hesitate to question Obama’s faith, they seemed more than willing to take Trump at his word that he was a Christian, despite constant boasting from the GOP nominee about his sexual promiscuity, lies and other unchristian actions.\n\nWhen Roller, the woman who questioned Obama’s faith because of something he did with his hands, noted that she didn’t know what church the president went to or who his pastor was, the HuffPost asked if she knew what church Trump attended.",

  "latent_17546": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nThis story first appeared on the Center for Public Integrity website.\n\nIt wasn’t quite cold enough to need a vest on a recent Texas morning, but Matt Dossey was wearing one anyway. Made of heavy canvas, the vest might have concealed a pistol. There was no way to tell. Perhaps that was the point.\n\nDossey is superintendent at Jonesboro Independent School District, which serves a tiny community in the rolling Texas scrubland north of Austin. In January, the district decided to arm a select group of staffers with concealed weapons.\n\nJonesboro straddles the border between Coryell and Hamilton counties; it’s more than 15 miles to the nearest sheriff’s department. The town is unincorporated, and has no government or police. If someone were to attack the school, Dossey said, no one’s coming to protect the kids—not quickly, anyway.\n\nDossey was standing inside the school cafeteria, where students motored around a room decorated with harvest-themed paper cutouts. The district was hosting a pre-holiday Thanksgiving dinner, when parents join kids for a school lunch of turkey and stuffing. Looking around the room, Dossey, who hadn’t taken off his vest, said the new policy adds a layer of security that most everyone in town is happy with.\n\n“If somebody walked in that door and opened fire,” he said, “we would have a chance.”\n\nEver since Adam Lanza killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, last December, school districts and state governments have searched for better ways to protect students. Lawmakers introduced hundreds of school safety bills. Many called for arming more security guards or for arming teachers. Others went the opposite direction, tightening gun laws.\n\nIn Monroe, Connecticut, just nine miles from Sandy Hook, residents supported a range of expensive measures. The town, which spreads out from a village green between two white-steepled churches, spent hundreds of thousands of dollars upgrading buildings and hiring school resource officers, town cops who are posted at schools. The move is largely in step with what happened statewide. Lawmakers passed sweeping legislation in April that included gun controls, such as expanded background checks and mandates for school security. The Legislature also funded millions of dollars in infrastructure grants and tightened state law covering guns in school so that only active or retired law enforcement officers can serve as armed guards.\n\n“I don’t believe a teacher would just kill a kid right there. I’ve walked up in front of a kid who had a gun. I know how it feels.”\n\nTexas, on the other hand, has not appropriated money to school security and is not creating mandates. Jonesboro is one of about 70 districts to arm staff since Sandy Hook. This year, the Legislature encouraged more to do the same, passing a bill that created a state-run training program that will allow districts to designate staff as “school marshals,” an entirely new class of law enforcement (districts must pay the costs).\n\nAt first glance, the disparate approaches appear simply to reflect a stereotypical divide between two regions of America with their own closely held views of guns and their place in daily life. But a closer look shows that what’s happened in Jonesboro and Monroe also reflects a broader set of beliefs about the role of government, about local control, and perhaps most importantly, about taxes.\n\nA Flurry of Activity\n\nJust after 9:30 a.m. on December 14, Lanza, 20, arrived at Sandy Hook Elementary School armed with a Bushmaster rifle and two pistols. Staff had just locked the front door, but Lanza shot his way through the entranceway glass. Down the hall, the principal, school psychologist and another staff member heard the shots and came to investigate. Lanza shot all three, killing the principal and the psychologist, before making his way to two first-grade classrooms, where he killed the children and four adults.\n\nA staff member had called 911 at 9:35 and police arrived within four minutes. Within a minute, Lanza shot himself. The entire episode lasted no more than 11 minutes, according to a recent report by the local state’s attorney (PDF).\n\nResidents and victims’ families soon formed groups, some supporting stricter gun controls. Several parents created Safe and Sound, an organization that offers tools for districts to improve security through planning and training.\n\nIn Washington, much of the debate focused on guns. Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president of the National Rifle Association, called on Congress to fund an armed police officer in every school. “The only thing that stops a bad guy with a gun is a good guy with a gun,” he said.\n\n“If somebody walked in that door and opened fire, we would have a chance.”\n\nPresident Obama announced a broad plan in January encompassing gun control and school security. But his signature initiative, calling for background checks on most gun sales, died in the Senate in April. The security measures fared better. The Justice Department gave $46.5 million in grants in the 2013 fiscal year to fund 370 school resource officers, who are being stationed in schools nationwide. Districts have added thousands of such officers on their own, said Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers—augmenting the 10,000 or so already in place. In June, the Education Department published a how-to guide for schools to create emergency plans.\n\nBut federal funding for several school safety programs has dropped steadily since receiving a boost in 2009. The COPS program, which pays for community police efforts including school resource officers, saw funding cut by more than 80 percent, to $178 million in fiscal year 2013, for example.\n\nState legislatures have acted as well. Lawmakers sponsored bills on school safety in every state, introducing more than 500 this year, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL). Dozens became law.\n\nWhile most focused on emergency planning or safety grants, South Dakota in March became the first state to explicitly allow schools to authorize their staff to carry guns. Lawmakers introduced similar bills in 34 states, according to NCSL, passing them in six others. In several states, including Colorado, Oregon, and Ohio, districts have used existing laws to arm staff.\n\nNearly every state generally bars guns from school grounds, but many give districts some wiggle room. Texas, for example, has for years allowed schools to authorize people to carry weapons on campus. Other state laws are open to interpretation. But few if any districts had armed teachers before Sandy Hook, other than one in rural Texas.\n\nOver the past few years, however, gun groups began pushing to expand the exceptions, according to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence. In April, an NRA panel published a model bill for states that would allow districts to make their own decisions on arming staff. The organization did not respond to an interview request.\n\nA Different Culture\n\nMatt Dossey stands tall with a genial demeanor, and at 40, he’s as close as Jonesboro has to a town leader, serving not only as school superintendent, but also as minister at the Baptist church. Dossey grew up in Gatesville, about 15 miles southeast. And aside from attending college in Abilene, he’s spent practically his whole life within a 15-mile radius. His wife, Emily, and mother, Mildred, each graduated from Jonesboro High School. His older son, who’s 6, attends the kindergarten.\n\n“We live in a place where our kids are familiar with guns…It’s a different culture out here.”\n\nHe’s not the only one to stay close to home. Standing in the cafeteria, he could point to the children of his childhood friend, or to a young teacher who was his student years ago. While the small-town feel engenders trust, he said it makes securing the school a maddening task. Parents expect to go where they please. Closing doors isn’t foremost on kids’ minds.\n\nDossey had first proposed the idea of arming teachers to the school board after he came to the district in 2011, citing Harrold, a rural district in north Texas that adopted a similar plan in 2007. Some board members were hesitant. “Anytime you put weapons in an atmosphere where you’ve got a bunch of kids, you’ve got to be careful,” said Keith Taylor, president of the school board.\n\nSandy Hook convinced Taylor and other trustees that it was worth that risk. On January 17, all seven members voted to adopt the plan.\n\n“We live in a place where our kids are familiar with guns,” Dossey said, describing how students camp out with their guns by the football field each summer, when irrigated grass creates a green oasis amid the dry landscape. “Armadillos love to come to our football field and dig up holes rooting for worms and grubs. Well, our kids go down there armadillo hunting,” he said. “It’s a different culture out here. Everyone has guns in their home, if not for skunks or whatever, then for intruders.”\n\nDespite the culture, some have resisted arming teachers. Most of the state’s larger districts have their own police departments and have said they will not arm other staff. In Austin, district police hired six school resource officers this year to patrol the city’s 79 elementary schools—they already had officers at each high and middle school.\n\nBill Bond, school safety specialist for the National Association of Secondary School Principals, doubts that an armed teacher would actually stop a student bent on killing peers. He was the principal at a high school in West Paducah, Kentucky, in 1997 when a student killed three classmates. “I don’t believe a teacher would just kill a kid right there,” he said. “I’ve walked up in front of a kid who had a gun. I know how it feels. I think you’d hesitate.” More likely, he said, is that an armed teacher would lead to a deadly accident.\n\nLaw enforcement groups have spoken against arming school staff. Several have said that police could accidentally shoot a teacher holding a gun. Some insurers, such as EMC Insurance Companies, which covers most Kansas districts, have said they would decline coverage to any school that allows employees to carry guns.\n\nDossey has seen little of this opposition and speaks of his program in a confident tone. He and the board selected a few staff members for the program before buying them firearms and tapping the local sheriff to help with training. The district has kept their identities secret. Members of the program get together once a month for target practice.\n\nThe school district is also replacing old doors and installing a buzzer system for the front entrance, which is now unlocked. The work will cost about $50,000, Dossey said, and will come out of a broader $700,000 bond that voters approved in May. Dossey says arming a few staff will cost about $8,000 this year, compared to at least five times as much for a resource officer.\n\nIn 2011, the state legislature cut the education budget by more than $5 billion. While lawmakers restored about $3.3 billion this year, those cuts continue to loom large.\n\n“The first thing I heard out of Lt. Gov. Dewhurst’s mouth was about how we train teachers to carry guns. Well, welcome to Texas.”\n\nBut even though Dossey would rather hire a school resource officer if he had more money, he told his state representative that he opposed a bill that would have allowed districts to levy taxes to pay for security measures, including the hiring of resource officers. Taxes are not popular in Texas. The bill never saw a vote.\n\nLinda Bridges, president of the Texas affiliate of the American Federation of Teachers, opposes arming teachers, and she’s skeptical of districts’ claims that they don’t have the money to hire a resource officer. “The issue really is, what are the priorities?” she said.\n\nBridges and other teachers’ advocates say the push in the capital for arming teachers was as much about politics as it was about safety. Within weeks of the Sandy Hook shooting, Gov. Rick Perry voiced support for allowing more guns in schools. Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst went further, calling for state funding to train teachers to carry guns (Perry later vetoed a bill that would have provided up to $1 million for this, citing several shortcomings, including the cost).\n\n“I didn’t hear him talking about how we make our schools better,” said Ken Zarifis, president of Education Austin, the city’s main teachers union. “The first thing I heard out of Lt. Gov. Dewhurst’s mouth was about how we train teachers to carry guns. Well, welcome to Texas.”\n\nSafety Trumps All\n\nNearly 2,000 miles away, Superintendent James Agostine is operating under different circumstances. Sitting at his desk in Monroe Elementary School, a two-story building perched on a rise above the Monroe Turnpike, Agostine can monitor dozens of security cameras across the district’s five schools, with the images neatly organized on one of two monitors connected to his computer. The cameras are part of a technology upgrade the district purchased after the shooting in neighboring Newtown. The district also installed new door locks in many classrooms, replaced outer doors and added two school resource officers to the two it already had.\n\nThe district installed double-sets of doors to the schools’ front entrances, so visitors must now get buzzed through consecutive locked doors, a level of security more common at banks. In case of an incident, the receptionist can now hit a red panic button that dispatches police to the school.\n\nNo one needs a reminder of what happened nearby. The Monroe district, in a heavily wooded community in southwestern Connecticut, is housing Sandy Hook Elementary at one of its buildings while Newtown builds a new school. And Agostine, dressed in a checked shirt and tie, seems to have embraced the role of protector.\n\n“In my career, the top priority is safety,” he said. “Safety trumps all.”\n\nOver the past year, Monroe has spent nearly $815,000 upgrading security at its schools, leaning heavily on those infrastructure changes. Like the state as a whole, Monroe can afford to spend more than most—median income here is about $108,000.\n\nIn April, the Legislature in Hartford passed some of the country’s tightest gun controls—requiring background checks on all gun sales and expanding the list of banned assault weapons—along with a handful of school security measures. Lawmakers and the governor created panels and commissions on everything from mental health to security, including the School Safety Infrastructure Council, which is expected to release recommendations in January that will eventually be required as part of any state-funded school construction. In the meantime, the state has spread $21 million in grants across two-thirds of its districts, helping them upgrade facilities. Many districts added school resource officers, but no one talked seriously of arming teachers.\n\nThere’s a powerful sense of before and after in Connecticut (school administrators refer to the day, like 9/11, by its date, 12/14). “It’s becoming not only more acceptable but more of a public demand for security in schools,” said Donald DeFronzo, commissioner of the state Department of Administrative Services and chairman of the School Safety Infrastructure Council. “Parents want to believe that when they drop their kids off in the morning that they’re leaving them, next to home, in the most secure place anywhere.”\n\nDeFronzo said the council is working with the federal Department of Homeland Security to adapt a security assessment tool now used for federal buildings. Rather than prescribe blanket fixes, the tool will help districts identify security weaknesses while suggesting a range of corrective measures.\n\nAll this will come with a cost. DeFronzo said the requirements could add up to 15 percent to any given construction project. Connecticut schools have spent about $530 million a year on school construction over the past five years, with the state covering more than two-thirds of that. New security measures could tack on tens of millions of dollars annually. While the state budget office expects a surplus for the next two years, it recently projected a deficit of $1.1 billion for the year beginning July 1, 2015.\n\nWhile Monroe did not apply for state grants, the district was lucky. Administrators had already been looking at security upgrades before the shooting, and were prepared to spend part of the regular maintenance budget. Savings on medical expenses last year allowed them to devote an additional $240,000 to the work. They hired consultants, attended conferences, updated their emergency plans (the new law includes requirements for these plans). The preparation meant the district was ready to move immediately.\n\n“Within months of Sandy Hook happening, everybody is getting busy,” Agostine said. “You can’t find a contractor now to come in and design a new system. They don’t have the horses in the stall.”\n\nStill, the town of nearly 20,000 didn’t avoid debate over the costs. In April, voters rejected an annual budget that included funding for three new school resource officers. After some residents questioned the need for additional officers, the town cut one of the positions from the budget, which was then approved in a subsequent referendum.\n\nAgostine seems comfortable speaking about the security measures, some of which began before the shooting, but he acknowledges they come with a social price, too. “Years ago it would not be uncommon for a parent to come in with their child, walk down to the classroom, help the child at their locker, give them a kiss and send them into the classroom. Now we say, ‘Leave them at the door,’ ” he said. Later, Agostine compared their work to the broader security measures Americans experience, like near-constant surveillance. “The cost of our society in terms of security is that we give up a little bit of that autonomy.”\n\nThe Center for Public Integrity is a nonprofit, independent investigative news outlet.

  "latent_17691": "Upon the death of Steelers owner Dan Rooney, we reached out to a group of players and friends to get their personal memories of a man who shaped the lives of so many in Pittsburgh and beyond.\n\nHines Ward\n\nWide Receiver (1998–2011)\n\nWhat Dan Rooney meant to the hundreds of Pittsburgh Steelers players whose lives he touched over the years is tough to put into words. We all called him Poppa Rooney, because he really was like a father figure to so many of us.\n\nI’ll always remember getting drafted in 1998, and walking through the doors at Three Rivers Stadium. One of the first people I saw was Mr. Rooney, and when I shook his hand that initial time I kind of shook it gingerly. I was cautious, for whatever reason. Well, he looked at me for a second, and then he had me do it all over. So we tried again — it was like a redo. That second time around we had a nice, firm handshake, and he looked me square in the eyes, and then he just talked to me. That encounter made an impact on me. I didn’t grow up with my father, so I learned little life lessons from subtle things like that. And, you know what? That’s one of the first things I taught my son as a kid: When you meet someone, shake their hand firmly, look at them in the eye and speak clearly. So there are values he instilled in me that I’m passing down within my family.\n\nKeith Srakocic/AP Images\n\nProbably my favorite memory of Mr. Rooney dates back to early 2006. Six months before I had held out from the first few weeks of training camp in Latrobe, and when I reported I apologized to him for any negative attention I might have brought on the team by holding out. Mr. Rooney was just so wonderful about the whole thing. “It’s over with now, Hines,” he said. “Forget about it. Just go out and help us win the Super Bowl.” When we beat the Seahawks to win our fifth Lombardi Trophy, I was named Super Bowl MVP. I still remember seeing him on the field afterward and just sprinting up to him and giving him a big ol’ hug while the confetti was flying everywhere. It was a moment of pure joy for both of us, and I’ll never forget it.\n\nJerome Bettis\n\nRunning Back (1996–2005)\n\nWin or lose, one thing you could always count on after a Pittsburgh Steelers game was Mr. Rooney coming into the locker room to tell you he appreciated your effort out on the field. It wasn’t just every once in a while, or after big games. It was every game, like clockwork.\n\nAnd when Mr. Rooney showed his appreciation, it couldn’t have been more genuine. You could tell he cared deeply about you when he looked you in the eye and said, “Thank you.”\n\nEven more wonderful, though, was that he didn’t just care deeply about his players. He cared about our families, too. It was as though we were all part of his own family, and he was always looking out for us. If he could help you out in any way, he was going to help you — and sometimes in ways that you never would’ve expected.\n\nI remember at one point during my second or third year with the Steelers Mr. Rooney called me into his office. I wasn’t sure what was going on, and then when I got in there he asked me about my parents. He said that he had heard my mother and father attended every game, even when we were on the road, and he asked me if that was true. When I told him it was, he smiled and paused for a second. “I’d like them to have better seats, Jerome,” he said. “I want them to have my seats. They’re part of the family. And I want to make sure they’re taken care of.”\n\nMatt Freed/Post-Gazette\n\nI remember leaving his office that day and thinking, Wow, that kind of thing is not supposed to happen in real life. But that’s the type of person he was. He wanted to do that for my family. I didn’t ask him to get some good tickets for my folks because they were sitting way up in the nosebleed seats on the road. He did it because he genuinely cared about us.\n\nFrom that day forward, for every road game my parents sat a few rows behind the team bench. And that meant that I could always find my mother and father in the crowd.\n\nMr. Rooney brought us together in that way for no other reason than because he knew it would be something we’d appreciate. His kindness truly knew no bounds.\n\nRyan Shazier\n\nLinebacker (2014–Present)\n\nWhen you’re a Steeler, you get used to winning. It’s part of the tradition here. But in the NFL, you’re going to have some really rough days. It’s inevitable. There have been so many times when I’ve walked into the facility after a loss, and my body was hurting, and I was in such a terrible mood….\n\nAnd then I’d see this older gentleman in a nice suit, with his white hair and glasses, walking towards me.\n\nAnd I’d just smile every time.\n\nMr. Rooney could change your day just by talking to you for a minute.\n\n“Ryan, how are your Buckeyes doing?” he’d say. “How’s your family doing? Do you need anything?”\n\nYou know, some people say stuff like that, and it’s just small talk. You can see in their eyes that they’re just waiting to leave and move on with their day. But Mr. Rooney wasn’t like that at all. He genuinely cared about how your Buckeyes were doing, or how your family was doing, or how you were feeling that morning.\n\nIt didn’t matter if you were a veteran or a rookie, or even a complete stranger off the street. Mr. Rooney treated everybody the same. You would never know that he was the owner of the NFL’s greatest franchise from the way that he carried himself.\n\nRonald C. Modra/Sports Imagery/Getty Images\n\nOn the night I was drafted by Pittsburgh, Mr. Rooney asked me a question that has stuck with me. He said, “Ryan, are you ready to be a Steeler?”\n\nI said, “Yes, sir.”\n\nHe said, “You know, it means a lot to wear that jersey. There’s a lot of tradition and a lot of responsibility that comes with it. Not everybody can be a Steeler.”\n\nI didn’t know exactly what he meant at the time.\n\nBut now I know. Every time I saw Mr. Rooney at the facility, his attitude and kindness reminded me of what it meant.\n\nMr. Rooney, you were the prime example of what it means to be a Steeler, and you changed so many people’s lives. You’ll always be in my heart.\n\nCameron Heyward\n\nDefensive End (2011–Present)\n\nIf I know one thing about Mr. Rooney, I know that he would not want today to be a sad day. I always felt like his entire mission in life was to make people feel better. And how many people in this world can you say that about?\n\nI remember when I got hurt last season, and I was rehabbing, Mr. Rooney was going through some physical therapy of his own. He came up to me one day and shook my hand and looked me in the eye, and said, “How are you doing, Cam?”\n\nI said, “I’m coming along, Mr. Rooney.”\n\nHe kept his handshake firm, and he kept looking me in the eye, and he said, “You know, Cam, we always have your back.”\n\nIt’s hard not to get emotional when I think about that today.\n\nJamie Squire/Getty Images\n\nMr. Rooney was so thoughtful and compassionate in the way he approached everybody. He was a great, honest, caring human. If you spoke to him once, you walked away from the conversation feeling like you were special to his heart. That will be his legacy. And what better legacy can you have?\n\nI know that Mr. Rooney’s father (The Chief) and my own father (Ironhead) are up in heaven welcoming him to a better place today.\n\nFarewell, Mr. Rooney. You were a once-in-a-lifetime person.\n\nThomas Tull\n\nFriend and Pittsburgh Steelers part owner\n\nWhen I first met Mr. Rooney in 2005, it was like meeting the pope. Actually, who am I kidding? It was even bigger than that. As a lifelong Steelers fan, I had idolized him since I was a kid. And when we met, he turned out to be all that I had imagined and more. I was extraordinarily fortunate because Mr. Rooney and I hit it off right away and built a very close relationship over the years.\n\nOne thing he’d always come back to during our conversations was the importance of doing the right thing. I used to go to him for life advice, and any time I was having difficulty with a decision he would sit me down and say something that will stick with me for as long as I live. “Thomas,” he’d say, “life is a series of decisions you make that add up to your reputation. Do the right thing.”\n\nCraig Barritt/Getty Images\n\nHe just always had this incredible moral compass grounded in compassion and consideration and kindness — traits that I saw him display every time I was around him.\n\nOne day when we met up a couple of years ago, he was wearing a Steelers pin on his jacket, so I complimented him on it. A second later he literally took it off and handed it to me. Then, three weeks later, I’m at the facility on the South Side, and he’s wearing a Steelers tie. Just in passing I say, “Great tie, Mr. Rooney.” He turns his head and looks at me for a second … and then he takes off his tie right there in the hallway and he gives it to me. He wouldn’t take no for an answer.\n\nI felt terrible about it, but that was just him. He’d absolutely give you the shirt off his back if he thought it would make you happy. And because of that, and everything else he represented, Mr. Rooney was universally loved. Steelers players going all the way back to Joe Greene and Franco Harris, up through Ike Taylor and Cam Heyward absolutely adored him. And I’ve never heard a single person say a negative word about him. Even fans on the road showed him love!\n\nIt’s funny, Mr. Rooney always wanted me to call him “Dan.” He’d tell me that every time I saw him. But I just couldn’t bring myself to do it. He was always “Mr. Rooney” to me. I could never call him Dan, but I was so proud to call him my friend.\n\nHe was one of the most special human beings I’ve ever met. I will miss him dearly.",
  "latent_17848": "Fast Facts: › Entangled particles influence each other instantaneously even when they are physically far apart. › In the 1960s, theoretical physicist John Bell proposed that a model of reality with hidden variables must allow for this entanglement. › Three papers published in 2015 support Bell's hypothesis.\n\nHere's a love story at the smallest scales imaginable: particles of light. It is possible to have particles that are so intimately linked that a change to one affects the other, even when they are separated at a distance.\n\nThis idea, called \"entanglement,\" is part of the branch of physics called quantum mechanics, a description of the way the world works at the level of atoms and particles that are even smaller. Quantum mechanics says that at these very tiny scales, some properties of particles are based entirely on probability. In other words, nothing is certain until it happens.\n\nTesting Bell's Theorem\n\nAlbert Einstein did not entirely believe that the laws of quantum mechanics described reality. He and others postulated that there must be some hidden variables at work, which would allow quantum systems to be predictable. In 1964, however, John Bell published the idea that any model of physical reality with such hidden variables also must allow for the instantaneous influence of one particle on another. While Einstein proved that information cannot travel faster than the speed of light, particles can still affect each other when they are far apart according to Bell.\n\nScientists consider Bell's theorem an important foundation for modern physics. While many experiments have taken place to try to prove his theorem, no one was able to run a full, proper test of the experiment Bell would have needed until recently. In 2015, three separate studies were published on this topic, all consistent with the predictions of quantum mechanics and entanglement.\n\n\"What's exciting is that in some sense, we're doing experimental philosophy,\" said Krister Shalm, physicist with the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), Boulder, Colorado. Shalm is lead author on one of the 2015 studies testing Bell's theorem. \"Humans have always had certain expectations of how the world works, and when quantum mechanics came along, it seemed to behave differently.\"\n\nTechnology used to study the \"love\" between particles is also being used in research to improve communications between space and Earth. Credit: NASA/JPL-Caltech\n\n› Larger image\n\nHow 'Alice and Bob' Test Quantum Mechanics\n\nThe paper by Shalm, Marsili and colleagues was published in the journal Physical Review Letters, with the mind-bending title \"Strong Loophole-Free Test of Local Realism.\"\n\n\"Our paper and the other two published last year show that Bell was right: any model of the world that contains hidden variables must also allow for entangled particles to influence one another at a distance,\" said Francesco Marsili of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, who collaborated with Shalm.\n\nAn analogy helps to understand the experiment, which was conducted at a NIST laboratory in Boulder:\n\nImagine that A and B are entangled photons. A is sent to Alice and B is sent to Bob, who are located 607 feet (185 meters) apart.\n\nAlice and Bob poke and prod at their photons in all kinds of ways to get a sense of their properties. Without talking to each other, they then each randomly decide how to measure their photons, using random number generators to guide their decisions. When Alice and Bob compare notes, they are surprised to find that the results of their independent experiments are correlated. In other words, even at a distance, measuring one photon of the entangled pair affects the properties of the other photon.\n\n\"It's as if Alice and Bob try to tear the two photons apart, but their love still persists,\" Shalm said. In other words, the entangled photons behave as if they are two parts of a single system, even when separated in space.\n\nAlice and Bob -- representing actual photon detectors -- then repeat this with many other pairs of entangled photons, and the phenomenon persists.\n\nIn reality, the photon detectors are not people, but superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). SNSPDs are metal strips that are cooled until they become \"superconducting,\" meaning they lose their electric resistance. A photon hitting this strip causes it to turn into a normal metal again momentarily, so the resistance of the strip jumps from zero to a finite value. This change in resistance allows the researchers to record the event.\n\nTo make this experiment happen in a laboratory, the big challenge is to avoid losing photons as they get sent to the Alice and Bob detectors through an optical fiber. JPL and NIST developed SNSPDs with worldrecord performance, demonstrating more than 90 percent efficiency and low \"jitter,\" or uncertainty on the time of arrival of a photon. This experiment would not have been possible without SNSPDs.\n\nWhy This is Useful\n\nThe design of this experiment could potentially be used in cryptography -- making information and communications secure -- as it involves generating random numbers.\n\n\"The same experiment that tells us something deep about how the world is constructed also can be used for these applications that require you to keep your information safe,\" Shalm said.\n\nCryptography isn't the only application of this research. Detectors similar to those used for the experiment, which were built by JPL and NIST, could eventually also be used for deep-space optical communication. With a high efficiency and low uncertainty about the time of signal arrival, these detectors are well-suited for transmitting information with pulses of light in the optical spectrum.\n\n\"Right now we have the Deep Space Network to communicate with spacecraft around the solar system, which encodes information in radio signals. With optical communications, we could increase the data rate of that network 10- to 100-fold,\" Marsili said.\n\nDeep space optical communication using technology similar to the detectors in Marsili's experiment was demonstrated with NASA's Lunar Atmosphere Dust and Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission, which orbited the moon from October 2013 to April 2014. A technology mission called the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration, with components on LADEE and on the ground, downlinked data encoded in laser pulses, and made use of ground receivers based on SNSPDs.\n\nNASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate is working on the Laser Communications Relay Demonstration (LCRD) mission. The mission proposes to revolutionize the way we send and receive data, video and other information, using lasers to encode and transmit data at rates 10 to 100 times faster than today's fastest radio-frequency systems, using significantly less mass and power.\n\n\"Information can never travel faster than the speed of light -- Einstein was right about that. But through optical communications research, we can increase the amount of information we send back from space,\" Marsili said. \"The fact that the detectors from our experiment have this application creates great synergy between the two endeavors.\"\n\nAnd so, what began as the study of \"love\" between particles is contributing to innovations in communications between space and Earth. \"Love makes the world go 'round,\" and it may, in a sense, help us learn about other worlds.\n\nNews Media Contact\n\nElizabeth LandauNASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Pasadena, Calif.818-354-6425Elizabeth.Landau@jpl.nasa.gov2016-042",
  "latent_18024": "Of all the wild twists and turns on this year's college football coaching carousel, the most fascinating may have come at Houston within the past couple of days. After Tom Herman left to replace Charlie Strong at Texas, reports surfaced Thursday that Lane Kiffin was set to become the Cougars' next head coach. Only to have Houston elevate its own offensive coordinator Major Applewhite for the gig a day later.\n\nSo what happened during that timeframe? And was Kiffin ever really considered? The answer is “sort of,” according to Houston board of regents chairman and super-booster Tilman Fertitta.\n\nFertitta actually heard Houston radio host Marc Ryan discussing the hire Friday night, and decided to call into the show to set the record straight — all while giving some fascinating details into the entire coaching search. You can here the audio here, but as Fertitta explains it, there was one major difference between the two candidates: Applewhite had the support of the Texas high school football coaches. Kiffin did not.\n\nArticle continues below ...\n\n“I think for numerous reasons [why we went with Applewhite instead of Kiffin],” Fertitta said. “Number 1, the Texas high school football coaches bombarded our athletic director. They said, ‘We want our players to play for Major Applewhite.’ Here’s a guy whose been on the big stage, he played quarterback at the University of Texas. He has a great relationship with the high school football coaches in Texas, Lane does not. That was a major ‘X’ against Lane compared to Major. Continuity in the program. The recruits today playing wanted Major Applewhite. They let it be known. It was just one thing after another that it steamrolled to Major.”\n\nFertitta actually mentioned Applewhite's relationship with the Texas high school football coaches two or three times throughout the interview, adding that at a certain point, “it's all about recruiting.” He also mentioned continuity a handful of times as well: Had Houston hired Kiffin, it would have been the third different coaching regime for some of the team's older players, who had already transitioned from Tony Levine to Tom Herman. Instead, Applewhite will basically keep things like they were under Herman.\n\nStill, despite hiring Applewhite, Fertitta also admitted that he wasn't expecting to name either Applewhite or Houston defensive coordinator Todd Orlando as the full-time head coach. He initially actually had his eyes on both Kiffin and Les Miles — and yes, he interviewed both.\n\n“I’ll be 100 percent honest with you: When this started, I thought we had to go out and get a name-brand coach. Because to me it’s all about brands. Nobody understands that better than me. And I wanted the University of Houston to stay relevant. I think Les Miles, he’ll be a fine coach for somebody. And I think the same for Lane Kiffin. I was very impressed. But when I looked at the whole picture in totality, I truly thought in my heart, and so did everyone else on the committee, that Major Applewhite was the right fit.”\n\nAnd then there was this interesting nugget: Remember the reports where Fertitta demanded Houston's next coach agree to a massive buyout, so they couldn't jump ship like Herman did? Well according to Fertitta, while it turned off some candidates, it didn't bother Kiffin one bit. Kiffin even told Fertitta to set up the contract however he liked.\n\nSo add it all up, and it leads to one, final, fascinating question. Was Kiffin ever actually offered the job?\n\n“Never,” Fertitta said. “He was no closer than anybody else. Those were all put out by his agent, because that’s how they play the game.”\n\nAnd now we know.",

  "latent_18210": "Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal’s op-ed in the New York Times marks the whimpering end of an unholy alliance. The letter itself was a ham-handed attempt to capture the 2016 evangelical vote before Sen. Ted Cruz does. But the very crudity of his piece revealed that the union at the heart of Movement Conservatism is ripping apart.\n\nIn his op-ed, Jindal undertook to explain to business leaders how Movement Conservatism works. Its political strategy, he lectured, “requires populist social conservatives to ally with the business community on economic matters and corporate titans to side with social conservatives on cultural matters.” The governor is right: Since the 1980s big business interests have managed to secure policies that have concentrated wealth at the very top of the economic ladder, and they have managed their coup only with the help of the votes of social conservatives.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nBut Jindal’s hyperbolic posturing as he warns “any corporation” “bullying” social conservatives into accepting same-sex marriage to “Save your breath,” reveals a touchstone moment: This grand alliance is over.\n\nIts end has been a long time coming. The toxic amalgam of economic and social reactionaries that Jindal identified began to mix after the Second World War. Americans in that era rallied behind the New Deal consensus. Reactionary businessmen loathed business regulation and taxation, but had no luck convincing voters to turn against the policies most saw as important safeguards against another Great Depression. Then, in 1951, a wealthy young writer suggested that social issues might be the way to break popular support for the New Deal. William F. Buckley, Jr. advanced the idea that unfettered capitalism and Christianity should be considered fundamental American values that could not be questioned. According to him, anyone who called for an active government or a secular society was an anti-American collectivist in league with international communism.\n\nFew Americans paid much attention to an argument that equated even Republican President Eisenhower’s wildly successful capitalist economy with communism. But desegregation gave Buckley’s Movement Conservatism the popular social issue it needed to turn Americans against an active government. The year after the Supreme Court handed down the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision outlawing segregation, Buckley launched his National Review, which quickly tied business regulation to unpopular desegregation of public schools. Buckley hired Virginia newspaper editor James Kilpatrick to assure readers that an active government that protected the rights of black Americans undermined American “freedom.”\n\nAccording to the National Review, Eisenhower’s 1957 use of the troops to desegregate Little Rock High School illustrated the New Deal’s destruction of America itself. The troops escorting black students into white schools were paid with tax dollars. This, in the formulation of Buckley and his allies, was a redistribution of wealth. Congress levied taxes on white people, forcing them to pay their hard-earned money into the treasury, which government officials turned around and used to give unearned advantages to poor blacks. Desegregation enabled Movement Conservatives to describe American “freedom” as a marriage of social conservatism to unfettered capitalism.\n\nThis odd formulation, in which equality became inequality and fairness turned into unfairness, slid into the fringes of the Republican Party with the rise of Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona as a national figure. His supporters launched his 1960 candidacy for the presidential nomination with a declaration of Movement Conservative principles, ghost-written by Buckley’s brother-in-law. \"The Conscience of a Conservative\" maintained that government protection for African-Americans was unconstitutional. It undermined property rights by redistributing tax dollars, and thus destroyed “liberty.” Goldwater captured the Republican presidential nomination in 1964, but voters revealed the unpopularity of his ideas when he carried only his home state of Arizona and the five states of the Deep South: South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi and Louisiana. It seemed the union of big business and social conservatism had collapsed.\n\nBut, over the next 20 years, that alliance would strengthen until it came to dominate American politics.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nOne of Goldwater’s key supporters in 1964 was an actor and spokesman for General Electric: Ronald Reagan. In a folksy televised speech just before the election, Reagan called out a dangerously intrusive government run by out-of-touch elites. America faced a clear choice. On the one hand was “individual freedom;” on the other, “the ant heap of totalitarianism.” When Reagan made a strong push for the 1968 presidential nomination, and George Wallace ran on a third-party ticket, Eisenhower’s far more moderate vice president Richard Nixon had little choice but to promise Goldwater voters in the Deep South that he would bow to their racial prejudices. This was the “Southern Strategy,” as Republican political operative Lee Atwater later explained in a vicious 1981 interview in which he deployed the n-word freely. Rather than explicitly invoking racism, he said, Movement Conservatives talked about desegregation, states’ rights and cutting taxes. Economic language didn’t create the same backlash because it was far more abstract than racial slurs, but it accomplished the same thing. It equated an activist government with the redistribution of white wealth to minorities.\n\nNixon’s troubled presidency required more than white racism to prop it up. To rally support behind his sliding popularity, he pulled more voters into the conservative social coalition by dividing Americans into “us” and “them.” When National Guard troops killed four people at Kent State in May 1970, Nixon took refuge behind the argument that a “silent majority” of Americans opposed the “vocal minority” that was trying to impose its views on the rest of the nation by protesting in the streets. It was imperative to hold the line not only against African-Americans, but also against young radicals and feminists. In 1971, Nixon set up a straw man as a dog-whistle for social conservatives. Unspecified “voices,” “detractors of America,” were urging “disadvantaged groups” to “take the welfare road rather than the road of hard work, self-reliance, and self-respect,” he claimed. Time noted that “middle Americans” were rapidly swinging against “angry minorities” who were sucking up their hard-earned tax dollars, while they seemed to have less and less influence on American policies.\n\nNo one made better use of this growing link between economics and culture than Ronald Reagan. In 1980, when he launched his general election campaign just miles from where civil rights workers had been murdered in 1964, Reagan announced: “I believe in states’ rights.” He personified the link between race, sex, and taxes with his “Welfare Queen,” who was a Cadillac-driving, unemployed moocher who “has 80 names, 30 addresses, 12 Social Security cards and is collecting veteran’s benefits on four non-existing deceased husbands…. She’s got Medicaid, getting food stamps, and is collecting welfare under each of her names.” Reagan claimed to speak for what he called “the majority of Americans” — hard-working, white taxpayers — against “special interests,” those lazy Americans, people of color and women, who wanted government handouts. As Rosalyn Carter said of Reagan, “I think this president makes us comfortable with our prejudices.”\n\nReagan urged Grover Norquist, who had been an economist for the Chamber of Commerce, to bring together big business, evangelical Christians, and social conservatives as a voting bloc to pressure reluctant congressmen into supporting tax cuts. “Traditional Republican business groups can provide the resources,” Norquist explained, “but these groups can provide the votes.” Norquist’s Americans for Tax Reform opposed taxes in any form, since taxes funded “social welfare schemes” that redistributed wealth. In 1989, Norquist’s friend Ralph Reed cemented evangelicals behind big business by pulling them into the Christian Coalition, which set out to spread both religion and unfettered capitalism. Movement Conservatives could win control of the country, Reed explained, only by addressing “the concerns of average voters in the areas of taxes, crime, government waste, health care,” abortion, and homosexuality.\n\nAdvertisement:\n\nPresident George W. Bush made the link between business and religion in government official. During his administration, White House officials met weekly with Norquist and a hundred leaders from religious, social and economic groups that made up the Movement Conservative coalition. “There isn’t an us and them with this administration,” Norquist boasted. “They is us. We is them.” A request by the Bush administration could marshal hundreds of thousands of constituents led by the members of the White House meetings. Their voices were amplified by talk radio hosts like Rush Limbaugh, who insisted that Congress must slash taxes and “begin an emergency dismantling of the welfare system, which is shredding the social fabric” and “gutting the work ethic, education performance, and moral discipline of the poor.”\n\nAnd so the marriage of big business and social conservatism to control government was consummated. But its stability depended on convincing evangelicals and social conservatives that slashing taxes and destroying business regulation served their social ends. Since 1980, those economic policies have concentrated wealth upward and left values voters with less and less. Rumblings of discontent have disturbed the coalition as real wages have stagnated and tax burdens have shifted down the ladder. Movement Conservatives continued to be able to rally support from evangelicals as they limited women’s reproductive choices and attacked minorities and immigrants as lazy criminals, but their power has slipped as the programs they slash increasingly harm values voters. Same-sex marriage marks the beginning of the divorce. Big business Movement Conservatives were happy to pay lip service to right-wing populism so long as it kept Republicans in power. But supporting it now will do the opposite, as most Americans swing behind non-discrimination.\n\nJindal’s op-ed offers Republicans a great opportunity. It employs the same rhetorical techniques Buckley did in 1951 — turning the popular majority in favor of equal rights into “the radical left,” for example — but now those techniques seem transparently, almost laughably, disingenuous. Seeing such a caricature of the bargain that made Movement Conservatism succeed could create the magical moment in which the party finally rejects the devil’s bargain it struck in the 1950s.",
  "latent_18217": "Microsoft may have slipped up and accidentally revealed a mysterious new smartphone dubbed the Lumia Phone X via its China unit. Not much is known about the handset as of now, but speculation suggests it might be the long-rumored Surface Phone.\n\nThe device came to light after a video was posted on the Microsoft China website. The content of the video itself is nothing new, as it’s just an ad explaining how Continuum works. The interesting part comes in the description where it mentions the Lumia Phone X as one of 3 devices along with the Lumia 950/XL and Acer Jade Primo which support the feature.\n\nMicrosoft has since edited the text and removed all reference to the new device. GSM Arena suggests the smartphone could be launched in 2017, since a recent report had hinted that the Lumia 650 may be the first and only entry for the series in 2016. The mid-ranger may be unveiled on February 1 via a blog post rather than a full-blown event.\n\nAlso See: Microsoft Surface Pro 4, Pro 3 unveiled in India\n\nFurthermore, the Lumia 750 and 850 have apparently been cancelled, contrary to reports that claimed the two would be outed during the next session of the Mobile World Congress. However, the Surface Phone is still on track, which makes the Lumia Phone X a likely candidate as an alternate name for the offering.\n\nThe Surface Phone is supposed to be revealed within the second half of 2016. It may have shown up at a browser benchmarking site a few months ago. The listing doesn’t reveal much in terms of specs, except that it runs on Windows 10 Mobile and had scored 401 out of 555 points in its test.\n\nStay tuned for more information on the Lumia Phone X.",
  "latent_18231": "A bizarre “non-religious” church in Texas is set to hold an event this weekend in which participates will drink a potentially-fatal chemical found in pesticides because the organization’s leader claims it holds the power to heal conditions including erectile dysfunction, the Houston Chronicle reports.\n\nJim Humble, the archbishop of Genesis 2 Church of Health and Healing, hawks “Miracle Mineral Supplement” as a cure-all for cancer, AIDS, arthritis, malaria, acne, erectile dysfunction and other ailments, the Chronicle reports. The catch? It’s made from sodium chlorite — a chemical used in pesticides, fracking and fabric bleaching.\n\nIt can be deadly if swallowed. Yet participants will fork over $500 a head for a three-day seminar at a Houston-area hotel to learn about the supposed health benefits of the “the world’s most important broad-spectrum, nontoxic anti-microbial agent.”\n\nThey will be sampling concoctions of the chemical as well, after event organizers “”provide the materials, bowls, scales, etc., to have you do it yourself.”\n\nState authorities have received one complaint against the group, which alleges they are a cult, the Chronicle reports. A spokesperson for the US Food and Drug Administration said there has been one death associated with medicinal ingestion of the chemical — though not related to Humble’s church.\n\nThe octogenarian claims to have discovered the elixir while on a mining expedition in South America. He also believes he can create gold and platinum by manipulating water, the Chronicle reports.\n\n“Five hundred thousand people died from taking FDA-approved drugs,” Humble lectured in an online video cited by the Chronicle. “It’s so ridiculous. It doesn’t make any sense at all – all these reports of health injuries. A couple of stomachaches is a health injury. … I’ve got to admit that’s as crazy a thing as any agency has ever done.”",
  "latent_18250": "Media publishers XO Group hosted Hack Upon a Cause in New York last weekend. ProgrammableWeb spoke with the organizers about how to manage a hackathon aimed at solving real world problems, and checked in with the FullStack Academy winners who learned to code at a bootcamp just four weeks prior to the event.\n\nXO Group - a global media company that publishes content focused on weddings, pregnancy and home ownership - partnered with AngelHack to host Hack Upon A Cause, last weekend (8 & 9 February). The hackathon challenged competitors to create sustainable tech solutions that 'improve the lives of women and teens around the world'.\n\nManaging a Hackathon for Social Good\n\n\"We're going through an awesome transformation at XO Group, building up socially-enabled new products and going through a similar transformation with our engineering department and moving to a more agile environment,\" Organizer Drew Koloski, Director of Talent Acquisition at XO Group told ProgrammableWeb. \"So we wanted to get involved with the New York developer community and share what we are learning and find a common cause in women's needs. At XO Group, we help women with some of the most challenging life events: organizing a wedding, having a baby, and setting up home. So we really wanted to try and get talented developers to help women solve other problems they may face in their lives.\"\n\nXO Group partnered with four non-profit organizations who were each given time to present their challenges to competitors at the start of the hackathon. While just under 350 competitors registered, a solid 150 designers and developers actually participated on the weekend.\n\n\"It was a really unique approach, usually hackathons are geared to letting developers come in and do their thing but at this event we have asked developers to work specifically on the problems our not-for-profit (NFP) partners are facing: making apps purposeful and realistic in terms of the NFPs who will be using them,\" said Koloski.\n\nHackathon competition challenges were also posted in advance on the event's Eventbrite page and included:\n\nApps that help the Seattle-based not-for-profit New Course demonstrate the link between the environment, women's inequity and poverty\n\nApps that can be used to prevent dating abuse and risk of domestic violence for Day One\n\nA secure, mobile solutions to connect young women in under-resourced communities who are part of a national mentoring network run by the Step Up Women's Network\n\nComplete a website project for Wish Upon a Wedding, a not-for-profit that provides free weddings to couples where one partner is terminally ill.\n\nPrizes included a $5,000 and acceptance into the 2014 HACKcelerator program for the grand prize, while 2nd and 3rd place received $3,000 and $1,500 respectively. Sponsor Firebase also offered subscription plans for the best hack built with the Firebase API, a database-as-a-service offering that helps apps store and sync their data.\n\nA Bootcamp Success Story\n\nThe winning team, mentorchat, consisted of three developers who all started learning to code at a FullStack Academy bootcamp just four weeks ago (their course continues until April 4). While across the country in California at present, bootcamps have come under the microscope as that State's education system seeks ways to accredit and regulate developer bootcamp programs. The move has raised hackles as much as eyebrows, with VentureBeat's Christina Farr delving into the implications for bootcamp providers who may face as much as $50,000 in fines for regulatory non-compliance, while guest poster David Selinger argued that since bootcamps don't claim accreditation, they shouldn't be subject to regulation.\n\nEven though they are across the country and outside of the State jurisdiction, New York developer bootcamps have been drawn into the debate, with a flurry of former students praising the services of providers including the FlatIron School, FullStack Academy and Thinkful.\n\nNow FullStack has another real-world testimonial to proffer: their students' success. All three team members of mentorchat completed their FullStack Academy bootcamp course four weeks ago. Eric Cook was a teacher before coding, with a computer science minor. Howard Kim was also new to coding, while Waine Tam probably had the most experience, according to the team. He had graduated college in 2001 and went on to work in finance for nine years before joining a non-profit two years ago. He has spent the last year self-studying coding via MOOC courses but FullStack Academy was his first class-based learning.\n\nThe team also credits Tam's background in working with a not-for-profit as a huge advantage for the team. \"The program knowledge really helped with both the pitch and development of the app,\" they said.\n\nUsing APIs to Create a 'Lean and Robust App'\n\nThe mentorchat team used Facebook APIs, the open-source Passport authentication, and a node module for SMTP to power their app. Organizer James Cox from XO Group called the solution a \"lean app that turns out a robust solution using a platform ready for the mobile environment.\" It was an approach the Step Up Women's Network can immediately start thinking of deploying.\n\nThe team created the solution to match Step Up's national mentoring network by facilitating a many-to-many chat approach: \"Our application allows any mentee to match up with any mentor who is online at anytime, it is polyschronous. Using Facebook APIs gave us an advantage as it is a ubiquitous platform and we didn't need to think about how to make it mobile.\"\n\nThe team hopes to use their HACKcelerator program participation to learn how to scale the solution for use by other not-for-profits.\n\nAll images of the event and winning team courtesy of Carly Zipp.\n\nBy Mark Boyd.

But scientists say the change is premature and could lead to the devastation of the gray wolf population in the state.\n\nThe state's kill-limit was set at 251 wolves by the Department of Natural Resources (DNR) — meaning about one-third of Wisconsin's wolf population could be killed legally. The hunt will last until February or until the limit has been reached.\n\nAccording to the DNR's website, no one had reported killing a wolf as of late Tuesday morning.\n\nThe gray wolf was removed from the endangered species list in 2011 following a decades-long federal government campaign to repopulate the animals after they were nearly wiped out in the early 20th century. Legal hunting seasons began in some states the next year, prompting an outcry from scientists who said the wolves' population was not yet at a viable level.\n\n\"These are arbitrary and capricious decisions that violate their own policies about what it means to recover a species,\" Amaroq Weiss, West Coast wolf organizer for the Center for Biological Diversity, told Al Jazeera.\n\nScientists are worried the wolf population in the state is still too fragile to survive hunts, and warn the wolves' disappearance will have significant impacts all the way down the food chain.\n\nThe gray wolf, which once flourished across the entire Northern Hemisphere, evolved over millions of years to play a crucial role in regulating its ecosystem.\n\nWolves tend to eat older, injured or less healthy animals, according to Weiss, which makes the wolves' species of prey healthier. Also, when prey like deer and elk are hunted by wolves, it keeps them on the move and prevents overgrazing.\n\nPlants and their roots, in turn, provide stability to riverbeds so they don't erode, and the flora also provides roosting places for migrating birds. Vegetation supplies beavers with materials for dams, which then create the deep pools that young fish need to survive.\n\n\"It's a beautiful, complex tapestry ... that shows the level of interaction that must happen between apex predators and their environment for the full health of the system,\" Weiss said.\n\n\"Yellowstone is a good example because of its tremendous photographic record dating from the 1800s, when wolves were still in the park, until today. Since wolves were removed in 1926, in the photos you see elk just standing around because there are no predators. And you see the elk's effect on vegetation by overgrazing because they are able to stay in the same area instead of constantly moving.\"\n\nThose who say the wolf population needs to be kept at a lower level say the hunt is a way to manage wolves that ravage farmer's livestock.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the goal is to eventually reduce the wolf population to 350, but experts say that number may be too low for the species to remain viable.\n\n\"Scientists used to talk about recovering species to the minimum viable levels; then they began to understand the complex ecological relationships and said instead we need the populations back at the level where they are functioning in the role they evolved to fill,\" Weiss said.\n\nTo maintain ecological stability, most scientists say 5,000 to 7,000 wolves are necessary in the Great Lakes region alone. But ranchers and hunters — and the political officials they support — disagree.",
  "latent_18292": "Objects in mirror are more expensive than they appear\n\nWant to make a small fortune in the chip business? Start with a large fortune.\n\nIt's an old joke, but it's one that still applies in these times of failed startups. Cases include Tier Logic's recent demise and Montalvo Systems' collapse. Like so many fabless semiconductor startups, Tier and Montalvo ended ignominiously not because of deficiencies in their technology, but because the companies simply ran out of money.\n\nThat may sound tautological, but it's not as obvious as it might seem. Starting and maintaining a new fabless chip company is more expensive than ever, and the costs aren't always evident, even to the managers and investors. Too many startups have stumbled in the home stretch merely because they underestimated the costs of keeping the business alive until the revenue began flowing. It's frustrating for everyone--engineers and investors alike--when the technology is sound and the product is solid, but the firm just runs out of gas and grinds to a stop, seemingly inches from the finish line.\n\nOur rule of thumb is that a leading-edge fabless chip company requires about $100 million to survive. About half is for product development. Startups today, unlike those of yesteryear, are taking on massive system-on-a-chip development projects. These aren't \"simple\" microprocessors, DSPs, video controllers, interface chips, or other easily understood single-function chips; they're complex and heavily integrated, with hundreds of millions of transistors fabricated in 40nm or better technology.\n\nDesigning such a complex chip requires lots of expensive engineering talent, to be sure, and plenty of computers, EDA software, testing equipment, and so forth. One or two spins of the silicon should be factored in, including tapeout fees, manufacturing charges, testing, and more. Nothing this complex is designed from scratch, so large chunks of the design will need to be licensed from third-party IP vendors, which adds more expense. We figure two years from first serious design effort to working silicon is typical. That's two years of toil, expense, risk, and revision before the product sees the light of day.\n\nBut that's only half the expense. The other half comes in the waiting.\n\nOnce the chip is ready, it takes another year to show it to customers and get that first critical design win. Blue-ribbon customers are generally loath to rely on a brand new chip from an untried startup, so the first design wins will likely come from fellow startups. These wins may provide some engineering validation, but they're unlikely to generate significant revenue. They also have limited PR value, since a design win by one unknown company from another unknown company doesn't stir up much excitement.\n\nThree years down the road, this fabulously expensive chip starts to sell in limited quantities to a few early adopters. The first revenue check is an important milestone, but the startup won't see any significant revenue until the end products' volumes ramp. For consumer markets, those shipments may grow quickly; for industrial equipment, the ramp is much slower, often measured in years.\n\nIt's this last phase that scuttles so many startups. They succeed on the engineering front but fail in budgeting. So many engineering-driven companies see chip development as the difficult (and expensive) part and neglect the late-period evangelism phase. The stark reality is that designing chips is easy; getting people to buy them is hard.\n\nTo make matters worse, this is precisely the point at which most startups need to begin work on their second-generation chip. The three-year cycle starts anew, even as revenue barely begins to pay off the previous design. With revenue likely being far below breakeven and another big design effort looming, investors lose confidence and pull the plug. Another successful chip (in the technical sense) falls by the wayside, a victim of inadequate financial planning.\n\nAfter seeing many fabless startups make the cut, but even more of them fail, we've developed a new rule of thumb: set aside half your budget for chip development and the other half for commercial breathing room. That's about $50 million for a leading-edge chip and another $50 million to bring it to market. Too many worthy firms have focused on the first half and neglected the second.\n\nJim Turley , editor-in-chief, Microprocessor Report\n\nThis editorial recently appeared in our Microprocessor Report newsletter.\n\nSource: http://blog.linleygroup.com/2010/09/how-to-blow-100-million.html\n\nMadgex Medio Systems Mippin MirriAd",

  "latent_18965": "North Korea said on Saturday that it had successfully test-fired a submarine-based ballistic missile, with Pyongyang described the operation as an \"eye-opening success.\"\n\nLeader Kim Jong-Un was said to have personally overseen the test, the official KCNA news agency said.\n\nThe operation was carried out by a sub that dived to launch depth on the sounding of a combat alarm. \"After a while, the ballistic missile soared into the sky from underwater,\" the agency said.\n\nKim was reported to said North Korea now possessed a \"world-level strategic weapon capable of striking and wiping out in any waters the hostile forces infringing upon (North Korea's) sovereignty and dignity.\"\n\nSuch a development would represent a major step in the country's attempts to develop a nuclear weapon, allowing it to deploy weapons far beyond the Korea peninsula. A submarine-based nuclear capacity would also give the country a second-strike capability if attacked on home soil.\n\nKim Jong-Un's personal initiative\n\nKCNA claimed the weapon had been developed on the personal initiative of Kim Jong-Un. There were no details about the missile's size or range, and it did not specify when the test was carried out.\n\nA US research institute said in January that such a capability posed a potential new threat to South Korea, Japan and US bases in East Asia. Pyongyang's ageing fleet of submarines are believed to be vulnerable to attack, although satellite images earlier this year showed the conning tower of what appeared to be a new North Korea submarine complete with launch tubes.\n\nNorth Korea compared the test to the successful launch of a satellite into orbit in 2012. That launch was condemned by the international community and led to a tightening of international sanctions against North Korea.\n\nrc/gsw (AFP, AP)",
  "latent_19213": "Michael Funk (left), who was a hostage during an armed standoff Saturday at Eagle Nation Cycles and was fatally shot by Neenah police as he exited the scene, is shown in this photo with Robert Barbiaux and shop owner Steven Erato.\n\nSHARE Brian T. Flatoff Associated Press\n\nBy of the\n\nAn hourslong standoff at a Neenah motorcycle shop that resulted in police fatally shooting a reportedly armed hostage has exacerbated an already-fraught relationship between the shop's owner and Neenah police.\n\nA year ago, Eagle Nation Cycles owner Steven Erato and Michael Funk — the hostage who was killed on Saturday — filed a $50 million lawsuit against the City of Neenah, Neenah police, Winnebago County, Neenah Police Chief Kevin Wilkinson and Capt. Thomas Long stemming from a 2012 raid on the motorcycle shop.\n\nAfter Saturday's standoff, Erato and his attorney Cole White have been out-front releasing detailed information about the incident. Erato was in the shop basement during the hostage situation, while three people — Ryan Moderson, Mike Petersen and Funk — were held at gunpoint upstairs by a suspect identified as Brian Flatoff.\n\nErato facilitated interviews with hostages, gave interviews himself and invited the news media to tour the shop this week. When a reporter asked if he thought he could be compromising the investigation, Erato balked.\n\n\"No, I don't,\" he said. \"I'm giving my opinion.\"\n\nBut the wide release of information about an ongoing investigation worries police.\n\n\"I will tell you I'm concerned about protecting the integrity of both investigations — the officer-involved death investigation and the criminal investigation to prosecute the perpetrator,\" Wilkinson said.\n\n\"The more that we talk about it in public, the harder it makes the prosecution.\"\n\nFlatoff was charged Wednesday in Winnebago County Circuit Court with second-degree recklessly endangering safety, felon in possession of a firearm and three felony bail jumping charges.\n\nFlatoff came into the shop drunk and armed with a Mac-10 handgun shortly after 9 a.m. Saturday, according to witness accounts and court documents. He apparently was upset about the sale of a motorcycle being repaired at the shop, and the man who bought the motorcycle, Vance Dalton, told reporters Flatoff had been threatening him and his family for weeks before the shooting.\n\nAbout a half-hour after Flatoff took hostages, police stormed into the shop, and gunfire erupted. An officer wearing protective armor was shot in the helmet during the rescue attempt. Moderson said police then pulled out of the building, leaving him, Petersen and the gunman inside. The gunman then let them go, and Moderson said he saw Funk wounded in the alley outside.\n\nFunk reportedly was fleeing the building when he was shot, and Neenah police say they opened fire only after he refused to drop a gun he was holding. Authorities continued to negotiate with Flatoff until he surrendered about 1 p.m.\n\nThe state Division of Criminal Investigation has been reviewing the shooting and released a statement that said its investigation, to this point, has shown that Funk was armed when fired on by police.\n\nThree Neenah police officers are on administrative leave during the investigation, which is standard procedure.\n\n\"One officer gets shot in the helmet, they turn around and run out, abandoning the hostages,\" Erato said. \"Then when one hostage gets out they shoot him. So yes, we're very aggravated with the Neenah Police Department and how they handled it.\"\n\nWhen asked about the history between Neenah police and the shop, Wilkinson referenced the department's mission statement, which describes officers as \"guardians standing between peace and peril to keep our community safe.\"\n\n\"We call it our calling,\" Wilkinson said. \"There's nothing in there that says 'unless the person has a lawsuit against us.' Our calling is our calling.\"\n\nErato has said he called 911 to report an \"active shooter\" and that the police response was \"horrible.\"\n\nPolice standoff procedures\n\nWilkinson and Community Liaison Officer Edgar A. Gonzalez said they couldn't speak specifically about Saturday's standoff, but they did provide information about general policies.\n\nDuring an active shooter scenario, if officers hear shots, they form a team and make entry as quickly as possible, Gonzalez said.\n\n\"The key with the active shooter is that the more time that passes, the more lives are lost,\" he said. \"With a hostage-taking situation, it typically slows things to the degree that we need to try to establish communications because there's a reason that the hostage is still there and still alive.\"\n\nIf officers come under gunfire, they have the option of moving to a point of cover, Gonzalez said.\n\nWhen it comes to confronting an armed person, it comes down to the officer's perception of danger, he said.\n\n\"With a gun, you have a lot of range where you can hurt somebody and potentially kill someone,\" Gonzalez said. \"When we encounter an armed person, we have very little time to make a decision. When we tell a person to drop their weapon and they don't do it, then we have to immediately raise our perception of threat.\"\n\nErato said he wants to see video that was taken during the incident.\n\n\"If they got him aiming a gun and threatening police, then he deserved to have gotten what happened, but I absolutely guarantee you that he did not do that,\" Erato said.\n\n\"He was a hostage, escaping, and got shot, which is very hard for us to live with,\" he said.\n\nErato has said if he had to do it over again, he would have taken his bow from the basement and fired at the gunman.\n\n\"Michael and me both made the mistake of counting on police,\" he said. \"This only reinforces our pro-concealed-carry permit, that people need to defend themselves because if you're going to wait on the police, that's not going to happen and they may shoot you when you go out the door.\"",
  "latent_19234": "PHILADELPHIA— Late yesterday afternoon, the fight to end Philadelphia’s civil forfeiture machine scored another major victory when a federal judge certified a class of property owners challenging the controversial practice of “policing for profit.” Under this practice, Philadelphia police and prosecutors take in millions of dollars each year in forfeiture proceeds, which they use to pay salaries and other expenses.\n\n“The core problem with Philadelphia’s forfeiture program is the direct financial incentive it gives police and prosecutors to seize and forfeit property,” explained IJ Senior Attorney and lead counsel on the case Darpana Sheth. “This practice injects impermissible bias into the forfeiture process, amounting to a conflict of interest that violates the constitutional guarantee of due process.”\n\nYesterday’s victory means that the four named plaintiffs in the lawsuit are now officially standing up for the tens of thousands of other property owners who were threatened with civil forfeiture under the Controlled Substances Forfeiture Act in the last five years. Since August 11, 2012, the district attorney’s office filed over 20,000 civil forfeiture petitions under that law, making it the overwhelmingly single largest source of all civil forfeitures in Philadelphia.\n\n“This ruling is a huge win for all Philadelphians who had their cash, cars, homes and other property taken illegally by police and prosecutors,” said Christos Sourovelis, the lead plaintiff.\n\nSpecifically, the court found that the plaintiffs’ request for a ruling declaring policing for profit unconstitutional and prohibiting the practice in the future are “classic examples of the types of claims that should be certified” under the federal rules. U.S. District Court Judge Robreno further clarified that his ruling would not bar property owners from pursuing any claims they have for money damages beyond the class action.\n\n“Today’s decision means that those who were kicked out of their homes, permanently lost their property through forfeiture, or otherwise suffered injuries are free to sue the city and the district attorney’s office for damages,” explained IJ Senior Attorney Robert Frommer.\n\nRead the entire opinion here.\n\nEach year, Philadelphia’s civil forfeiture program takes in almost $6 million from citizens, whether or not they have been charged with a crime, let alone convicted of one. Under Pennsylvania law, the city’s police and prosecutors get to keep all of those forfeiture proceeds for their own use. As a result, Philadelphia’s forfeiture revenue equals almost 20 percent of the annual budget for the district attorney’s office, with nearly 40 percent of those proceeds being spent on salaries—including the salaries of the very police and prosecutors doing the seizing.\n\n“When Philadelphia’s forfeiture machine is completely dismantled, this will send a signal to cities across the country that they cannot use their residents as ATMs by seizing as much property as possible,” said Sheth.\n\nThe Institute for Justice filed the lawsuit challenging the city’s civil forfeiture program in August 2014. In September 2016, the court severed the plaintiffs’ claim about law enforcement’s improper incentives for forfeitures from the rest of their claims related to the constitutionality of courtroom procedures used in forfeiture cases. The defendants in those claims also include administrators of the Philadelphia Court of Common Pleas. The court scheduled a hearing on these other claims for March 15.\n\nThe Institute for Justice is leading the fight against civil forfeiture nationwide. To learn more, visit endforfeiture.com.",
  "latent_19376": "When George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg-Gotha to Windsor during the First World War, it proved a masterstroke for the monarchy. Clive Aslet reports on the evolution of the House of Windsor – through George V, Edward VIII and George VI to Elizabeth II – in its centenary year.\n\nThe name was inspired. Windsor – a new house for the Royal Family that instantly evoked the permanence and pageantry of a castle. A century on, the choice of patronymic seems more appropriate than ever.\n\nArguably, despite the World Wars, the loss of empire and a social revolution, the Royal Family looks more secure than it did in 1917, the year that George V personally vetoed the government proposal that his cousin, Tsar Nicholas II, should be given asylum in Britain in case the monarchy here suffered the same fate as the Romanovs.\n\nTradition and romance, service and ceremony – these qualities, instantly evoked by the image of Windsor Castle, have provided the family that bears its name with what has mostly been an impregnable mystique.\n\nInspiration was not generally George V’s stock in trade. A younger son who didn’t expect to become king until his elder brother, the Duke of Clarence (‘Eddy’), died in 1892, he was happiest as a sailor and country gentleman.\n\nHe had no intellectual or artistic pursuits, hated public appearances and, for the first 15 years of his reign (until his mother’s death), was happy to forego the big house at Sandringham in favour of York Cottage, where he lived hugger-mugger with his family and attendant footmen.\n\nHG. Wells, who complained of ‘an alien and uninspiring Court’, noted the lack of panache, to which the King responded: ‘I may be uninspiring, but I’ll be damned if I’m an alien.’ To prove as much, he rebranded the family.\n\nSharethrough (Mobile)\n\nThe need for a change, precipitated by a German bomber\n\nThe decision to do so in 1917 might seem surprising, but may have been fired by two events of that year. In March, London was bombed by the newly commissioned Gotha G.IV – a name that focused public attention on the King’s Germanic roots – and on March 15, Nicholas II was forced to abdicate, ending the Russian monarchy.\n\nUntil then, there had seemed no need for change. To the despair of his courtiers, the King shared many of the austerities of the First World War with his people. Always a thrifty housekeeper, Queen Mary scrimped with zeal.\n\nThe Foreign Secretary A. J. Balfour’s private secretary recorded the dread with which courtiers left the luxury of their own tables to face ‘the Spartan regime of the Royal household’. When late for breakfast, an equerry, who had ordered a boiled egg, was reprimanded by the King, who implied that such gluttony might lose Britain the war.\n\nFor the duration of the hostilities, the King, a stickler for correct dress, ordered no new clothes other than khaki, in which he tirelessly reviewed troops, bestowed decorations and visited factories and hospitals.\n\nSurely his patriotism was beyond question? Besides, the conflict had already been raging for three years. As soon as war had been declared in 1914, pork butcher’s shops with Germanic names had been looted and, according to Graham Greene, dachshunds stoned to death in Berkhamstead.\n\nAlthough the composer Holst didn’t finally abandon the noble particle, to which his branch of the family was never really entitled, until September 1918, other people with foreign names had been quick to change them or leave the country. In Russia, St Petersburg became Petrograd in 1914.\n\nAdmittedly, the King’s predicament was more difficult. Although his surname was popularly presumed to be Saxe-Coburg- Gotha, even genealogists were not sure that it was not Wettin (the Prince Consort’s patronymic) or Guelf (that of the House of Hanover).\n\nIt was Lord Stamfordham, the King’s private secretary, still writing memos in the large script favoured by typewriter-hating Queen Victoria as her sight failed, who proposed the happy solution of Windsor.\n\nThe Kaiser cracks a joke; nobody in Britain laughs\n\nThe proclamation announcing the new name on July 17 gave the Kaiser the opportunity to make a rare joke: he hoped he would soon see a production of that charming operetta ‘The Merry Wives of Saxe-Coburg- Gotha’. However, nobody in Britain heard him. Like other constitutional innovations, the House of Windsor quickly became so established as to seem immemorial.\n\nGeorge V did not have the easy affability of his father, Edward VII, or son, Edward VIII, but neither did he share their weaknesses for loose living and controversial relationships. As his biographer, Kenneth Rose, comments, few in 1910 could have regarded his accession ‘with enthusiasm, or even confidence’.\n\nBy his death in 1936, however, this diffident, dull monarch had shown himself to be well suited to the needs of his people.\n\nAlthough an arch-conservative by temperament, he was sufficiently flexible – and sensitive to constitutional protocol – to force Lloyd George’s People’s Budget through Parliament by threatening to flood the House of Lords with new peers in 1911.\n\nWhen the Great Depression began to bite, he volunteered a 10% cut in his Civil List allocation and urged the Labour leader Ramsay Macdonald to form a national government, uniting the parties. Under this first embodiment of the House of Windsor, the British Empire reached its largest geographical extent.\n\nHis Silver Jubilee of 1935 was celebrated with fêtes, pageants, church services, sports days, decorated toffee tins and – needless to say, given His Majesty’s passion for philately – commemorative stamps. In faraway Timmins, in north-east Ontario, Canada, a three-mile-long parade of floats was mounted. According to the local paper, this demonstrated the extent to which ‘the love of Britain’s flag and Britain’s King, the emblems of an Empire’s sincere efforts for freedom, democracy [and] progress’ were enshrined in the hearts of the different people of the town, wherever they came from originally.\n\nThe House of Windsor has been at its best when following George V’s example. It might have been thought that Edward VIII’s appeal was more modern and better suited to the times – although his father had doggedly maintained the formality of the Edwardian court, the new King hated its stuffiness and rigidity.\n\nHaving been rapturously received on his visits to the USA, he enjoyed the freedom of American life: he remodelled Fort Belvedere as a British equivalent of the homes he had seen on Long Island: convenient, modern, designed for a life of sport and pleasure, based around what George V called ‘those damn weekends’.\n\nHis playboy charm won him many admirers in the age of the Hollywood matinee idol, but his father’s dire prediction that he would come to ruin within a year proved all too correct. His love of twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, the latest of a line of American girlfriends, caused him to abdicate after just 11 months.\n\nThe title, by which he was then known, Duke of Windsor, gave a prominence to the new family name that his father could never have expected. The Scottish Labour MP George Hardie said that the abdication crisis did ‘more for republicanism than 50 years of propaganda’. The House of Windsor was shaken.\n\nThe radiant young queen who proved the perfect tonic\n\nGeorge VI, who succeeded to the throne, was another younger brother.\n\nThat was not the only quality that he shared with George V. Like him, he was modest in his domestic tastes and loved family life. Although his father’s horror of the First World War had caused him to develop an unexpected degree of pacifism by the end of his life, his son also found himself to be a war leader: his behaviour during the Second World War was much the same as George V’s had been in 1914–18. He and Queen Elizabeth set an example of fortitude, duty and self-denial.\n\nAfter the Second Word War, the monarchy was prime among the institutions having to adapt to Indian independence and the loss of empire. The arrival of Elizabeth II to the throne in 1952 gave both the nation and the monarchy the tonic that they needed.\n\nHere was a radiant young Queen who personified the country’s new destiny as it began the difficult process of reinvention.\n\nBy February 6 2017, the anniversary of her accession, she had provided stability for 65 years, during sometimes gloomy and fractious times. A natural conservative, she adopted the idea of monarchy pioneered by George V – whom she called ‘Grandpa England’ – and developed by George VI, combining iron duty with devotion to family and an uncomplicated religious faith.\n\nFrom the accession to the annus horribilis\n\nIs the House of Windsor still a castle? Castles are designed to keep people out.\n\nOne of the challenges of a reign that has coincided with a media explosion – and an ever more scandal-mongering press – has been to manage access to the Royal Family’s inner life. Early experiments in raising the portcullis proved unsatisfactory: glimpses of what lay behind the curtain walls merely encouraged a greater degree of intrusiveness.\n\nIt may have seemed that the castle had been stormed altogether when Her Majesty suffered her ‘annus horribilis’ of 1992, when The Princess Royal divorced, Prince Andrew separated from his wife and Prince Charles’s marital difficulties erupted into the War of the Waleses. Clearly, structures that the early 20th century had erected were no longer serviceable in an age that had seen so much change, not least among the landed families whose way of life had once been similar to the royals. The fire that gutted the state apartments of Windsor Castle in 1992 seemed alarmingly symbolic.\n\nThe castle was rebuilt, however, and the House of Windsor has come into the 21st century in the same condition as Britain’s great country houses. Once they were written off as impractical, but a new generation has found ways of converting them to modern needs. Metaphorically, more informal living spaces have been created: grandeur can be laid on for those occasions when it is needed, but, at other times, the younger occupants can pursue lives that resemble those of other members of their set.\n\nThis can no longer be a castle in the conventional sense because no ramparts are strong enough to keep out the digital age, but then the life pursued inside this house, by its younger representatives, does not seem as strange or remote as that of half a century ago. Even so, the House of Windsor maintains the sense of otherness that is essential to its survival as the mechanism for providing the head of state.\n\nIt is a mansion with many rooms, expensive at times to heat. Eventually, wings may be closed, as it is realised that not all the members of a spreading family are required for public duties. These are matters for the future. The Prince of Wales is increasingly assuming more of the responsibilities previously shouldered by his mother: for the first time in the history of the House of Windsor, it will be represented by a champion of architecture. In a sometimes shoddy world, it will continue to express the vitruvian qualities of Firmness, Commodity and Delight.\n\nClive Aslet",

  "latent_19620": "ANALYSIS/OPINION:\n\nRICHMOND — On the edge of the practice field, Emmanuel Ogbuehi tugged off his white No. 80 jersey. The last barrier to all-out anonymity was replaced by a gray T-shirt darkened by sweat.\n\nThe warm breeze carried the familiar “R-G-3! R-G-3!” chants from a couple of thousand cooler-toting, sunscreen-smeared Redskins supporters restrained by yellow ropes.\n\nNo one shouted for Ogbuehi’s autograph Monday afternoon or, really, gave second thought to the rookie as he was one of the last players to depart the field.\n\nCellphone cameras and Sharpie-wielding autograph hounds and murmured conversations followed Griffin’s each move. A smile! An option keeper! A quick chat with offensive coordinator Kyle Shanahan!\n\nBut training camp in late July is about players like Ogbuehi, the guys who send you scrambling for a roster to decipher their number before the jersey disappears. There aren’t endorsement deals or big signing bonuses or feeding frenzies for autographs among those clinging to the edge of the 90-man roster. Each play, each minute is an opportunity to grab the coaching staff’s attention and keep their long odds of an NFL career alive.\n\nOgbuehi knows all about that. A few months back, he graduated from Georgia State with a chemistry degree and figured football was done. No team picked the tight end in April’s draft. Then the Redskins called.\n\n“I thought I was going to pharmacy school until this NFL thing came along,” he said.\n\nOgbuehi looked around. White tents. A few players lingered to sign footballs and T-shirts. Generators hummed, powering the lifts that allow filming of each move in practice. He offered a wide smile.\n\nThese were the guys he played on the “Madden NFL 12” video game not long ago. Now he’s one of them. At least for the moment.\n\nThat’s the question that never quite goes away on the roster’s brink. How long can he survive? Each walk-through, each practice, each preseason game, each cut-down date is a hurdle to clear. But Ogbuehi understands unlikely stories.\n\nHe walked on to Georgia State’s team in 2009 after playing wide receiver in high school, then spent a year practicing before the new program played its first game. His isn’t the story of a lauded, sought-after recruit. Ogbuehi even caught the school’s first-ever touchdown pass, a 4-yard grab against Shorter University in 2010.\n\nYes, Shorter University.\n\nLong nights and little sleep helped Ogbuehi juggle football and the chemistry degree while landing on numerous academic honor rolls. He shrugs off the effort as if that’s what everyone does, as if that’s normal. That same approach is how he expects to get through training camp.\n\nAt Georgia State’s pro day in March, he flashed the physical gifts that led to a contract with the Redskins. Standing 6 feet 3 inches with a handshake that seems like it could crush a football, he runs the 40-yard dash in a tick below 4.7 seconds. He’s strong. Versatile enough to line up at a variety of positions. Even has a 35-inch vertical jump.\n\nHis best trait?\n\n“Aggressiveness,” Ogbuehi said.\n\nThe numbers at tight end aren’t in his favor. That’s the arithmetic of an NFL roster that’s as cold as a post-practice ice bath. There’s presumptive starter Fred Davis. Logan Paulsen signed a contract extension during the offseason. Niles Paul is entering his third season. And the Redskins drafted fleet Jordan Reed from Florida in the third round.\n\nNone of that bothers Ogbuehi.\n\nReminders of the tenuous nature of his NFL career are everywhere. They include his bio on the team’s website. No picture. No background. Just his name and number and height and weight and school. Something that could disappear in an instant.\n\nWhen the NFL run ends, in a day or a decade, Ogbuehi is prepared to make the delayed trip to pharmacy school. Until then, well, he keeps repeating that word. Aggressiveness.\n\nThat’s life in the shadows of NFL training camp. A lone player in a T-shirt walking toward the locker room without attracting cameras or turned heads, carrying his jersey and his dream.\n\nCopyright © 2019 The Washington Times, LLC.

  "latent_19681": "Background checks indicate retail gun sales have been on a record pace for the past 18 months, and gun store owners say women are a driving force behind the surging sales.\n\nSelf-defense sales boosted handgun sales during the past two-and-a-half decades, only to transition from pure self-defense to self-defense for women who find themselves in the home alone or to grandmothers who want a means to protect themselves and their grandchildren during a day at the park.\n\nKPLR 11 quotes Steve King, owner of St. Louis’ Metro Shooting Supply, saying, “If I could open a new store it would cater to women and self-defense.” He said the last five years of his business has been driven by women with self-defense concerns.\n\nKing said his store offers shooting lessons every day, and “not only are the classes full, but women make up 80 percent of the class.” He added, “The more single household families we have where women are the head of the household, you have them realizing that not only are they only the provider financially and emotionally for children, but also the physical provider as well.”\n\nKing’s experience squares perfectly with what has been happening across the country during President Obama’s second term. The Crime Prevention Research Center (CPRC) shows that twice as many women as men have gotten concealed carry permits since 2012. Moreover, the highest percentage of permits has gone to non-whites. According to CPRC, “The number of women with permits has increased twice as quickly as the number of men with permits,” and there is evidence that “suggests that permit-holding is increasing about 75% more quickly among minorities than among whites.”\n\nThe growing involvement of women in the self-defense handgun market has changed the way guns look–the way they are designed–and has led to exponential growth in guns in .380 and other calibers with lower felt recoil. These changes mean women who have never fired a gun can now purchase one that fits their hand and quickly and comfortably acquaint themselves with it, allowing proficiency with shot placement if under duress.\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of “Bullets with AWR Hawkins,” a Breitbart News podcast.

  "latent_19723": "When Port Brewing sued Moylan’s Brewing of Novato, California in 2010 for using a distinctive Celtic cross tap handle design, Port’s Tomme Arthur didn’t expect craft beer fans to respond with an online flash mob of anger.\n\n“[W]e heard from hundreds of Craft Beer Enthusiasts who were outraged that we needed to sue anyone let alone another Craft Brewery. It was one of the most gut wrenching vitriolic laced days I have ever been a part of,” Arthur, the co-founder and chief operating owner of Port Brewing, wrote in a 1,000-word statement. Based in San Marcos, California, Port Brewing is best known for its The Lost Abbey craft beer.\n\nThe reaction from craft beer fans was so strong that Arthur felt compelled to explain his company’s legal position—but he ultimately made no apologies. “The bigger and healthier the Craft Brewing business gets, the harder it is to be unique and distinctive. Intellectual Property is something that all breweries (small and big) need to value. It’s one of the biggest assets we can own,” he said in his online statement.\n\n“Our current policy is to actively police new applications across beer, wine, and spirits and proactively converse with applicants whose marks we think could be stepping on our toes,” Arthur explains in a recent email to Quartz. “Our consumer base is passionate. We appreciate that. But trademarks have to be defended, which isn’t always easy to communicate to fans.”\n\nPort Brewing ultimately dismissed its lawsuit after the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted the brewery trademark protection for the tap handle design, according to Arthur.\n\nTrademark disputes have drawn enough unwanted attention that attempting to educate outspoken fan bases has become part of craft breweries’ media strategies. “Consumers may be drawn into loyalty situations without all the facts at hand,” Arthur acknowledges. Therefore, craft brewers are using their company websites, Facebook pages, and Twitter accounts to get their side of the story out.\n\nCourt of public opinion\n\nAs craft beer brands proliferate, brewers are increasingly turning to the courts or the USPTO to protect their trademarks—and beer enthusiasts aren’t happy about it. Craft beer fans are taking to social media and using online petitions to pressure the plaintiffs into resolving their disputes out of court. In some cases, it’s working.\n\nLagunitas Brewing Co.’s trademark lawsuit against Sierra Nevada Brewing Co. is probably the most dramatic example of craft beer fans’ power.\n\nIn its complaint, filed on Jan. 12, 2015, Lagunitas argued that the Chico, California-based Sierra Nevada’s forthcoming Hop Hunter IPA label and packaging used bold, black lettering for the “IPA” that looked too much like the IPA lettering on the Lagunitas IPA. The letters’ similar design and spacing could confuse consumers, alleged Lagunitas. Craft beer fans pounced on the news of the lawsuit in an unexpected storm of Twitter criticism.\n\nTony Magee, founder and CEO of Lagunitas, based in Petaluma, California, dropped the lawsuit just one day after filing the action, even as he cited the business reasons underlying the complaint. “Today, January 13th 2015, has been the worst day ever in 23 years of growing my brewery. Worst. Growing a biz involves defending a biz …” Magee tweeted. He declined to be interviewed for this article.\n\nThe craft beer industry is booming. The industry generated $19.6 billion in 2014 and made up 11% of the total US beer market, according to the Brewers Association. There are 4,144 craft breweries in the United States, up from 3,000 in 2014, with an average of two craft breweries opening every day, the Brewing Association reported in November 2015.\n\nAn increasing number of breweries mean more names, logos, and designs needing trademark protection from the competition. And the fact that, for trademark purposes, beer, wine, and spirits are all lumped into one category makes coming up with non-infringing names and designs exponentially more difficult.\n\nAt the same time, the craft beer industry is growing up. Established craft breweries are transitioning from struggling start-ups to mature businesses. Yet, the industry’s image of a laid-back group of beer connoisseurs persists. The Brewers Association points out that craft brewers tend to be very involved in their communities and connect with their customers through charitable work, volunteerism, event sponsorship, and product donations.\n\nBut craft brewers’ efforts to build community spirit might be coming back to haunt them. With fans not hesitating to express their opinions publicly, craft brewers are finding they have some explaining to do.\n\nThe Lagunitas lawsuit was one of the first instances of craft brewer-on-brewer legal aggression that drew national attention, probably because it involved two nationally known craft beer giants, explains Alva Mather of Griesing Law in Philadelphia. “It was a wake-up call for the industry,” Mather, who represents alcohol industry clients, but was not involved in the Lagunitas litigation, tells Quartz.\n\nMagee put considerable effort into preparing Lagunitas’ lawsuit, but was caught off-guard by the consumer reaction and decided pursuing litigation wasn’t worth the backlash, says Mather.\n\nDavid vs. Goliath\n\nA strong sense of community, combined with the passion people have for things that are handcrafted, encourages craft beer fans to speak their minds, says Greg Avola, co-founder of craft beer social media platform Untappd. The fans feel a real connection with the people who make craft beer,” Avola tells Quartz. “They feel like they’re part of the company as a whole.”\n\nAdditionally, craft beer fans generally think litigation is a tool used by big corporations, not small brewers, says Avola. And they definitely don’t like to see a David vs. Goliath scenario in which a larger craft brewer is perceived to be bullying a smaller one, he adds.\n\nTake for example the recent case of Bell’s Brewery. In March of 2015, the Galesburg, Michigan brewery filed a trademark challenge against much smaller Innovation Brewing of Sylva, North Carolina. After hearing about the action, a group of irate Innovation supporters launched a Change.org petition demanding Bell’s Brewery withdraw its challenge.\n\nIn the petition, 700 craft beer enthusiasts known as The Secret Beer Group call on “like-minded people who think craft beer is about togetherness and not crushing small business to boycott Bell’s Brewing until they drop this trademark dispute.” The petition has drawn 5,582 supporters, but so far Bell’s Brewery isn’t budging.\n\nAt issue is Innovation Brewing’s name, which Bell’s Brewery argues could cause confusion with its own slogan “bottling innovation since 1985.” The two brewers have each made their positions public online. Innovation founders Nicole Dexter and Chip Owen posted their six-point defense on the brewery’s Facebook page, while Bell’s Brewery vice president Laura Bell addressed the dispute on the company’s blog. A spokesman for Bell’s declined to comment on the pending action.\n\nCollaboration not litigation\n\nCraft beer fans obviously have high expectations of their favorite brewers. It doesn’t help that back in 2006 two small brewers set a lofty conflict resolution standard with their near-legendary creation of Collaboration not Litigation ale.\n\nLike many craft brewers, Russian River Brewing in Santa Rosa, California, is partial to thematically named beers and offers brews such as Redemption, Perdition, Benediction, Sanctification, Supplication, Damnation, Temptation, and Consecration. After Russian River added a Belgian-style ale named Salvation to the line-up, owner Vinnie Cilurzo realized Avery Brewing in Boulder, Colorado also made a beer called Salvation.\n\nCilurzo says he introduced himself to Avery Brewing’s owner Adam Avery at the Great American Beer Festival and pointed out the name problem. Avery visited Russian River and the brewers “noodled around” with various blends of the two Salvations before coming up with the new ale they dubbed “Collaboration not Litigation,” Cilurzo tells Quartz. Avery Brewing, which has the larger distribution capacity of the two breweries, still makes and distributes Collaboration not Litigation and Russian River sells the ale at its brew pub.\n\n“Just a phone call”\n\nNegotiation is always preferable to litigation, which costs time, money and may harm a brewer’s reputation. Griesing Law’s Mather points out, however, that while a litigious brewer might see a temporary dip in sales on its local turf, there’s no evidence that suing another brewer hurts sales in the broader market.\n\nIt’s also important to note that plenty of craft brewers resolve their differences quietly and out of the public eye. Approaching another brewer about a potential trademark conflict may not be easy, but it doesn’t have to be contentious, says Cilurzo of Russian River. “Usually, it’s just a phone call and we’re good.”\n\nSometimes this means one party agrees to change the name of a beer or even its brewery. For example, Foolproof Brewing Co. of Pawtucket, Rhode Island, changed its name from High Jinx Brewing just before opening in 2012, citing concerns by unnamed sources over potential market confusion and trademark infringement.\n\nBut in an industry growing as rapidly as the craft beer business, not every disagreement will be resolved amicably. At this point, legal actions are inevitable, no matter how much craft beer enthusiasts may hate it. “I get that the consumer feels it’s not in the spirit of the industry,” Cilurzo says. “But at the end of the day, it’s a business and trademarks are part of our business.”\n\nThis article is part of Quartz Ideas, our home for bold arguments and big thinkers.",

  "latent_20000": "book review: A Birthday Cake for George Washington\n\nTitle: A Birthday Cake for George Washington\n\nAuthor: Ramin Ganeshram; Vanessa Brantley-Newton\n\nDate: Scholastic, 2016\n\nNarrator: Delia\n\nGeorge Washington and the people he enslaved may receive more attention than any other facet of slavery in the United States. Whether due to the documents that were well maintained by his estate or because some people let the fact that this Founding Father owned enslaved humans give them some sort of validation, we find numerous books and documentaries relating to George Washington and the people he owned.\n\nA Birthday Cake for George Washington by Ramin Ganeshram and Vanessa Brantly-Newton is the story of Hercules, the first White House chef, while he is in the midst of preparing a birthday cake for George Washington’s birthday. Things go awry when he realizes there is no sugar in the cupboard. “Not brown, not cake nor fine.” The story meanders to build a background for this chef, who eventually realizes that he can indeed bake the cake without sugar. The story is narrated by his daughter, Delia, who is often accompanied by a young boy who appears quite comical throughout the text and we later find out he is the Kitchen Boy. The children’s roles in the kitchen aren’t quite clear; they seem happy being there.\n\nWe’re eight pages into the story when we realize that Hercules is a “slave”. I have to use quotes here because this is the word Ganeshram chooses to use and I think it works against her. Up to this point (and even beyond) the book’s illustrator, Brantley-Newton surrounds Hercules with people physically looking up to him and with much admiration. After stating that Hercules is a “slave”, Ganeshram goes on to describe the clothes he wears, what type of entertainment he chooses and the time he spends walking in the streets, often alongside free Blacks. But, we never find out what it means that he’s a “slave”. Ganeshram elevates Hercules to such a prominent level, but never explains that he is outstanding for doing these things because he’s a “slave”. She builds him up, showing us a fully developed human being who is enslaved, but never develops that condition. His life was not just like a free white person of that era, but readers have no reason to understand that. Ample documentation exists to support how demanding Washington was of the Whites, indentured servants and enslaved Blacks who worked for him and of his unyielding demands to get his money’s worth from the slaves he owned (Hirschfeld, 1997, Wiencek, 2003) . Both he and his wife came from the aristocratic class and were used to manage slaves (Bryan, 2002). Knowing this makes it difficult to accept that Hercules managed his kitchen (including white chefs who worked for him) but he did. There would really be a story to tell if the terms of this enslavement were more fully developed.\n\nBrantley-Newton in her Artist’s Note states “While slavery in America was a vast injustice, my research indicates that Hercules and the other servants in George Washington’s kitchen took great pride in their ability to cook for a man of such stature. That is why I have depicted them as happy people. There is joy in what they have created through their intelligence and culinary talent.” We’re talking about people in the 18th century who had no corner grocery store, no electricity and no running water. We’re talking about people who were the servants who had to grind the wheat, make the candles and stoke the fires. Washington expected all his people to work from sunrise to sunset. The closer they worked in proximity to him the more they would be scrutinized. The enslaved people knew that not being free meant they could be denied privileges, sent back to Mt. Vernon or sold if they were displeasing to their master. If that’s not enough to make you question smiling enslaved people, do wonder why Hercules would run away on Washington’s birthday just one year later. Fully developed humans no doubt have the capacity to grin, smile, giggle and laugh but when this image of happy enslaved people is repeatedly portrayed in children’s literature it substantiates slavery as acceptable for black people by indicating their acceptance of this situation and it thus continues to dehumanize.\n\nThe Children’s Book Council calls the book “the true story of an enslaved girl’s father who baked an unforgettable birthday cake for America’s first president.” This is not a true story, rather it is loosely based upon facts. I don’t think Ganashram herself refers to this as a true story, in fact she delivers much of the truth in her Author’s Notes. Here, in a tone inviting young readers to finish the story, she states that Hercules’ daughter never worked in the kitchen and it is here she states that Hercules ran away a year later. She doesn’t mention that Hercules was allowed to earn an income by selling kitchen scraps and that he actually never baked cakes. These particular facts don’t diminish the story Ganashram has created but they do more fully inform us about the real man.\n\nThe last image in the book, the paternalistic arm of our Founding Father around one of his\n\n“slaves” simply adds to the myth of George Washington. I critically asked myself for whom this book is written and I think it’s written for a multitude of young readers to show them the greatness of this black man. However, this greatness is delusional because the most important part of his story is missing. Hiding these facts does indeed diminish the story. The book concludes with notes from the author and artist and a recipe from Martha Washington but, no sources are cited.\n\nCitations\n\nBryan, Helen (2002). Martha Washington: First lady of liberty.

  "latent_20153": "If you’re anything like me, whenever you think of Russia your mind immediately conjures images of onion domed buildings, beautiful ballerinas, furry hats, vodka, and of course, dashcams. Now, what if I were to tell you that a game straight from the motherland allows you to play as a dashcam? Too good to be true, you say? Well why don’t you put a bookmark in your favorite copy of Anna Karenina, grab yourself a White Russian, and let me tell you about my brief and exhilarating trip into ‘The Light‘.\n\nI had a chance to play the recently Greenlit ‘The Light’ a few days ago, and long story short, I was thoroughly impressed. Reminiscent of ‘Dear Esther‘, this single player experience takes you to, “a world without humans. Where the peace and the beauty of the world reign. The history of probable futures of mankind, the mystery of our evolution, our progress, and our desires for luxury and infinite resources.” What does that mean exactly? Well you are most certainly alone, and the world is certainly beautiful, but the rest is completely up to interpretation. Billed as an “interactive philosophical story”, this game dazzled me with its stunning visuals and intense, often creepy, atmosphere. The strong use of lighting, etherial music, and a hefty dose of motion blur truly put you in a dream-like state as you wander around the dilapidated building and surrounding areas.\n\nIn contrast, the controls are very minimalist: mouse to look, WASD to walk, SPACE to jump, F for flashlight. You want to interact with something? Fine. Just walk into it. Done. Shut up about it.\n\nAll the positive gushing aside, there were some things that irked me. A small complaint is the fact that you clip through most of the objects strewn about the environment. This game is all about immersion, and walking through a row of waist high benches is a quick way to break that suspension of disbelief. In that same vein, I ran into a host of invisible walls. These walls weren’t keeping me from leaving the map (those walls were actually walls or fences), but rather restricting me from walking “as the crow flies” through the world. Again, it broke the suspension of disbelief and made the outdoor areas, at times, feel more like hallways instead of open spaces. My biggest complaint, however, begins and ends with one thing. Stairs. Sure, the fact that you clip through most of the objects bugged me, and yes, the numerous invisible walls bothered me too, but those are peanuts compared to stairs. For whatever reason, you cannot walk up certain staircases without repeatedly jumping. You can walk down just fine, but getting back up is a tedious task at best. It was annoying, broke the immersion, and made the game feel unfinished somehow. Perhaps when the game is released on Steam it will feature fully functional stairs, but for now you’ll have to channel your inner Skyrim and make do.\n\nAlthough it was brief (maybe 45 minutes), I loved the time I spent with ‘The Light’. I found myself immersed in a gorgeous world full of lens flares, particle effects, and cryptic storytelling. It was a thought provoking experience that allows you to draw your own conclusions, even if you conclude that you have no idea what’s going on.\n\nAdvertisements",

  "latent_20269": "Text Size: A- A+\n\nCaught between wanting to be an ideal swayamsevak like Mohan Bhagwat, and a moderniser like Vajpayee, Prime Minister Modi could become an Indira-like statist.\n\nJoseph Heller’s Catch-22 Lieutenant Milo Minderbinder earned his fame trading with himself, in a way that everybody involved in the circular transaction made a profit which, ultimately, came out of the government’s pocket. The reason he became an enduring brand ambassador of cynical capitalism is precisely because nothing mattered to him except profit for his company (called the Syndicate). He always made a profit, usually buying up the entire supplies of some commodity: eggs, tomatoes in a village, selling at a monopoly price to his own unit.\n\nExcept once, when he bought up the entire stock of Egyptian cotton in the world. There were no buyers left, as even if somebody bought it from him, they sold it back to him. In creative desperation, he even soaked balls of cotton in chocolate and tried selling them to his fellow soldiers’ mess. He had killed the Egyptian cotton market by becoming a monopoly trader — with himself.\n\nBut the genius figured out a way. Why not sell it to his government? Of course, as a pucca capitalist he believed the government had no business to be in business. But the sarcastic words of former laissez faire American President Calvin Coolidge (one with a hundred quotable quotes) came in handy: It’s the business of the government to be in ‘business’! Coolidge was, after all, a president, and what he said must be right, said Milo, government’s business is to be in business. So why not sell the cotton to the US government instead.\n\nNow replace Milo Minderbinder with Bharat Sarkar, post-1969, and Egyptian cotton with India’s banks. See that economics play out now. Indira Gandhi first nationalises all of India’s major banks and creates a state monopoly in banking and finance, particularly as it also owns all insurance companies and developmental financial institutions (former ICICI, IDBI, IFCI etc).\n\nThen it starts buying from itself: getting banks to invest in its own bonds, lend for its own projects and PSU enterprises, its loan melas and then, ultimately loan-waivers. So effectively its banking monopoly also became its unbeatable vote-buying business. In the process, the banks kept going bankrupt at regular intervals.\n\nNow, since the banks were all state-owned, they couldn’t be allowed to fail and the government is too big to fail and it has the power to tax, and print money. So the government again buys its own banks (recapitalisation). And if it has to be done through an off-budget method so as not to make the fisc look bad, you can have your banks issue bonds. Which, in turn, you can get your other companies, PSUs holding spare cash, to buy. Now tell me, isn’t our government an even sharper capitalist than Milo Minderbinder? It’s even better in fact. If his economics was Catch-22, Bharat Sarkar’s is one better, Catch-23.\n\nIf you are the googling type, you might be tempted to ask how does all this Catch-23 sarcasm square with my published appreciation of the latest bank bailout plan. It is a good plan, because it is the only thing possible under the circumstances. If your patient is asphyxiating in an extreme asthma attack, and you are the doctor, what do you do but pump the body with steroids, never mind the side-effects.\n\nSo, in a situation where 70 per cent of banking is state-owned, is near-bankrupt (bad loans generally exceeding their capital) and a collapse looms, what do you do? Let one domino collapse and pick up the debris? In a situation where something had to be done, this bailout is decisive, bold and, if I may add in fairness, a little bit creative. The idea of issuing bonds to raise a bulk of the funds is smart. But now the suggestion that other cash-rich PSUs, obviously mostly energy monopolies, would be “nudged” to buy these, is disturbing.\n\nThere were bolder, more decisive and reformist options. Great leaders never waste a crisis, but Narendra Modi blew one here. We aren’t so unreasonable as to demand that he should have fully reversed Indira Gandhi’s worst economic legacy, bank nationalisation. Toxic economic ideas have a very long half-life. But he could have made a beginning by selling off just the two most stressed small PSU banks, and then announced that each year for the next 10, one government bank with the most messed-up balance sheet will be sold. It would have electrified the markets, shocked his other banks into better behaviour, constrained the political class from writing more tax-payer cheques to buy votes, and marked Modi’s name among the great reformers.\n\nBut is that really what Modi wants, to be remembered as an economic reformer? Commitment to PSUs, or of government being in business, may not be the only touch-stone of a reformer, but it is an important one. No Indian leader, not even Manmohan Singh, P.V. Narasimha Rao and P. Chidambaram, have dared to sell off PSUs, especially profit-making ones. The only one to have that instinctive commitment was Atal Bihari Vajpayee.\n\nHe was thwarted by a Supreme Court order rooted in the 1970s political economy – it barred any disinvestment without parliamentary sanction and prevented the sale of two oil giants, HPCL and BPCL. We would have expected Modi to pick up the thread from his own party’s idol, Vajpayee. What’s he doing instead? He is selling HPCL. But to his own ONGC. Once again Milo trading with Milo, with the state’s money. Catch-23.\n\nNarendra Modi’s supporters have a point that unlike the period 1991-onwards when much reform could be carried out by stealth, today everything is in the public eye and has political consequences. But who is better equipped than Modi to mould public opinion? The questions, therefore, are: why is he not doing so? Does he even want to do so? And if not, what exactly does he want?\n\nThe answers lie in his politics. Unlike Vajpayee, he is a committed swayamsevak, and unlike him again, instead of dismissively laughing at the juvenility of the old RSS socio-economics, he is a true believer in ideology. Caught between his ingrained devotion to the idea of being a swayamsevak in the image of a Mohan Bhagwat, and an urge to be remembered as a modernising reformer like Vajpayee, he ends up as another Indira Gandhi, another great statist. A great economic-nationalist running an expanding and increasingly control-freak government. I would hazard to read his politico-economic mind as: there’s nothing wrong with the state running the economy, as long as you run the state wisely, and honestly. The quest for the perfect state has never succeeded. It is unlikely to now.\n\nModi has spent his youth and middle age as a full-time swayamsevak and that conservative upbringing won’t evaporate. But his exposure of the world now, meeting global leaders, watching how more successful economies and societies function would also make him want to embrace the neo-liberal ideal. The two forces, socio-religious conservatism and neoliberalism— whatever their faults — are contradictory. They can’t coexist. That’s the politics where Modi’s economics is trapped. What do we call his dilemma? Let me suggest: Catch-24 Politics.\n\nWant to hear experts engage over the big issues of the day? We bring you Talk Point.\n\nShow Full Article",
  "latent_20428": "Marijuana Soda – A Different Kind of High\n\nLike on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Pin to Pinterest Share on StumbleUpon +\n\nIf you’re looking for a refreshing alternative to that soda in the grocery shelf, then you don’t have to wait any longer. Barring the passing of a law or a natural disaster, then a new line of soda is ready to hit the medical-dispensary shelves – marijuana-laced sodas.\n\nWho would’ve thought that the hit Four Loco drink couldn’t be topped? Now here’s a product that will surely blow our minds away. The marijuana soda is the brain-child of designer Clay Butler, who is also the owner of a beverage company in Soquel, California. While his is not the first company to market marijuana-based beverages, this could pretty much be the first to market it in a different way.\n\nEven the flavors evoke images of a fun, vibrant, and lively drinking experience. Carrying labels such as Canna Cola (the flagship brand), the line also carries a Doctor Pepper alternative called Doc Weed, lemon-lime flavored Sour Diesel, a grape-tasting Grape Ape, and the usual orange-flavored Orange Kush.\n\nThese beverages will be sold in medical-dispensary stores beginning this February, and will be priced at $10 to $15 per can. It also boasts of having 35 to 65 milligrams of THC (tetrahydrocannabinol), which is the main psychoactive ingredient in cannabis. This is considered much milder than the regular brands currently sold. Initially, this will be sold in the Colorado area, but the makers are hoping to get it into California this spring.\n\nLike on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Pin to Pinterest Share on StumbleUpon +\n\nComments\n\ncomments",
  "latent_20552": "Irish actor Robert Sheehan has been added to the cast of the Dean Devlin directed feature film Bad Samaritan. Robert, who played bad boy Nathan in the E4 series Misfits, joins David Tennant in the thriller which is due to start shooting around Portland, Oregon later this year.\n\nBad Samaritan centres on a pair of young car valets who use their business as a front to rob their wealthy customers. The ploy is a success until the day that they target a house where they discover a woman is being held captive...\n\nThe script has been written by Brandon Boyce and the movie will be produced by Dean Devlin through his own company Electric Entertainment, with co-producers Marc Roskin and Rachel Olschan.\n\nDean Devlin has also recently directed Robert Sheehan in the sci-fi action thriller Geostorm which hits cinemas in October 2017.\n\nFor all the news about Bad Samaritan click here",
  "latent_20557": "Senate Judiciary Committee member Sen. Al Franken (D-MN) (L) covers his face in frustration as he questions witnesses from Google, Facebook and Twitter during a Crime and Terrorism Subcommittee hearing in the Hart Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill October 31, 2017 in Washington, D.C.\n\nChip Somodevilla/Getty Images\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Committee seemed to prove this week that it will rubberstamp any judicial nominee President Donald Trump sends over, no matter how unqualified. On a party-line vote, the panel said this past week that Brett J. Talley should have a lifetime appointment to the federal bench in Alabama, reports the Los Angeles Times. It apparently made no difference to the Republicans on the panel that Talley, 36, never tried a single case and has been a lawyer for only three years. What qualifies him for the job? Maybe several incendiary blog posts, in which he denounced “Hillary Rotten Clinton” and called efforts at gun control legislation after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings the “greatest attack on our constitutional freedoms in our lifetime.” He also urged his readers to join the National Rifle Association.\n\nAll of that combined surely contributed to the American Bar Association rating him as “not qualified.” Although he’s hardly unique. Four of Trump’s judicial nominees have received the rating that the ABA had not doled out since 2006. Talley’s nomination now has to go to the full Senate, which is also expected to approve his appointment on a party-line vote despite objections from civil rights groups.\n\nTrump has touted the way he has been able to fill judicial vacancies with staunch conservatives as one of the victories of his administration. Little wonder. When he came to power, there were more than 100 vacant seats in federal courts after Republicans basically blocked anyone proposed by President Obama in his last years in office. Trump has now nominated 59 people to federal courts, compared to the 27 judicial nominations Obama had made at this point in his presidency.\n\nTrump has praised Talley as the “untold story” that “nobody wants to talk about.” Last month, Trump pointed out that the judicial appointment “has consequences 40 years out, depending on the age of the judge.”\n\nEven critics agree this is one of the few things in which Trump’s administration actually seems to be succeeding. “This is the most under-appreciated aspect of the Trump presidency: judicial nominees are the only area in which the Republican White House is actually succeeding in getting what it wants,” MSNBC’s Steve Benen writes.",

Sign Up , it unlocks many cool features!\n\nrawdownloadcloneembedreportprint text 12.21 KB Sky Factory Modded Skyblock v1.3 ================================ List of Mods and change log found here: http://www.atlauncher.com/pack/SkyFactory/ Hello and thank you for trying out Sky Factory, my modded skyblock pack! If you want to know more about me and my livestream, scroll to the bottom section of this document. I've wanted to play a heavily modded version of skyblock for some time, and I've finally gotten all the mods required to make it happen! Sky Factory revolves heavily around the Ex Nihilo mod and it's companion Ex Alquio. If you have never used them before you NEED to learn how they work before you will get anywhere with this pack. In fact, questions such as \"how do I get redstone\", \"how do I get diamonds\", etc. will be met with me telling you once again that you NEED to learn Ex Nihilo. All the info you need is at their mod pages here: Ex Nihilo: http://bit.ly/1jeeF3p Ex Alquio: http://bit.ly/NM6yQE Also, a wiki here: http://bit.ly/1pad7Ze I'm having a lot of fun playing this pack and I'd love lots of other people to see and use it also, so please feel free to use this modpack in your youtube videos, livestreams, public or private servers or just share it with friends! And if that wasn't clear enough: YouTube/Twitch/Server Permissions ========================== YES, you can use this mod pack to stream, make videos/letsplays, make public or private servers, or whatever else you want. It's a public pack! I couldn't stop you even if I wanted to! Some sort of credit to me as the maker of the pack would be appreciated but is not required. Important Note For Streamers And Content Makers =============================================== The default world gen has you standing on a tree over a single piece of dirt. Thanks to Ex Nihilo the game can start like that just fine...it just takes a while. Thanks to a mod called Tree Growing Simulator 2014, instead of just sitting there forever waiting for the tree to grow, you can now spam your shift button (aka twerk) or sprint around the saplings and it will occasionally apply a bone meal effect. Watch for the particles to know it's working. If that doesn't suit you and you'd rather have a traditional skyblock start you may want to consider editing the config file YUNoMakeGoodMap.cfg and changing S:platformType=tree to S:platformType=skyblock21 instead. This will give you the classic skyblock v2.1 map, and makes the early game go much much faster by skipping right to the stone age. Another option would be to cheat in a watering can. That speeds up tree growth a ton. Otherwise, if you've got the guts to try it, just go for it! Getting/Installing The Pack =========================== Sky Factory is distributed on the AT Launcher and is public for everyone! You can download the launcher at http://atlauncher.com and all updates to the pack will be done through the launcher as well. You should be prompted with an option to update if there has been a change to the pack. Install the launcher, run it, then click on \"packs\", find Sky Factory and click \"new instance\", and you should be good to go. Also be sure to click the \"Settings\" tab and make sure you have plenty of ram allocated, and the PermGen set to at least 256. If it's not letting you allocate more than 1 gig of ram then you need to install 64 bit java. This is different! Where do I start? ==================================== Here's a quick breakdown of how the early game goes when using the default terrain gen: THIS IS A SPOILER IF YOU'D RATHER FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN: Yes you are *supposed* to spawn in a void on top of a tree over a single piece of dirt. This is not a bug! To start, make a crafting table then a Crook. Use crook to break leaves. Careful not to spill stuff into the void! Make barrels to compost extra saplings so you can make more dirt. Make more barrels so that you can capture water when it rains. Expand your base, make more dirt, plant more trees. Use the silkworms to infest leaves, use crook to break infested leaves to get string. Use string to make a sieve. Use sieve to sift dirt to get seeds for food, and stones which can be made into cobblestone so you can make a furnace. Make a hammer and hammer cobble to get gravel hammer gravel to get sand, and hammer sand to get dust. Use gravel, sand, and dust in the sieve to get ores. Get a bucket as soon as possible. Once it rains put dust into a barrel full of water to make clay. Sieve dust to get bone meal and use the clay and the bone meal to craft an unfired crucible. Cook the crucible in a furnace and place it over top of a heat source such as a torch (and later, lava or fire). Fill the crucible with cobblestone and it will melt into lava. Use your bucket to collect the lava from the crucible and the water from the barrels to make a cobblestone generator. Once you have the cobble gen it becomes a lot more like a standard modded Minecraft play, and you can use the challenges below to give yourself direction. For more info about the sieve, crucible, barrels, or crook read the Ex Nihilo page: http://bit.ly/1jeeF3p or their wiki: http://bit.ly/1pad7Ze A Note About Biomes =================== THIS MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A SPOILER IF YOU'D RATHER FIGURE IT OUT ON YOUR OWN! Barrels fill with water just fine when it snows so there is nothing wrong with spawning in a snow biome such as Taiga. It does not rain in desert so barrels will not fill with water, but that is still a fine place to spawn because of the alternate way of getting water. Look up the crafting recipe for a water bucket in NEI to see that. Oceans will spawn monsters but will not spawn passive animals, and Mushroom biomes spawns only Mooshrooms and no monsters. Because of that Ocean and Mooshroom are both viable places to spawn in, it will just add to the challenge and force you to travel if you want to complete all the challenges. As a bonus, a viewer managed to spawn in a mushroom biome in a Sky Factory world! Here's the seed if you'd like it: 3427162931496724061 Sky Factory Challenges ====================== How do you beat the pack? Well, it's Minecraft so you don't ever technically \"beat\" the pack, but I've provided a list of challenges designed to help you progress, give direction to your play, as well as stretch your knowledge of the mods and of Minecraft itself. If you have no idea how to do some of these things, that's ok. In fact it's the whole point!

If you have more info about this bug please let me know. - Breaking a Magic Crops plant before it is full grown can cause a seed with a different data value to drop, causing it to not export as expected with AE Precision Export Buses. Add both seed types to your export bus to compensate. - Sometimes your clone from Sync mod will become immune to damage. I know of no way to fix that other than using a different clone. Using this to your advantage definitely falls into the category of exploiting a glitch. - Lucky Blocks will occasionally cause a crash when opened. This seems to be fairly rare. We might have a reward configured wrong. If you find it, let me know. - Some people have reported their worlds not getting saved when they leave and relaunch the game. I can't seem to reproduce that, and I don't know what causes it or how to avoid it. Please let me know if you have more info about it. - Sugar Cane from Magic Crops can drop with a data id that makes it unusable. Waiting on a fix from Magic Crops mod.

Requires adjustments, after 2014 and after 2018, of the initial and final premium percentages to reflect the excess (if any) of the rate of premium growth over the rate of growth of income and the consumer price index.\n\nReduces from 9.8% to 9.5% of a taxpayer's household income the maximum amount an employee's required contribution to an employer-sponsored plan may be for such employee to be treated as eligible for employer-sponsored minimum essential coverage.\n\nIncreases the percentage of employer cost sharing for the out-of-pocket expenses of individuals with household incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty line.\n\n(Sec. 1002) Revises the provisions setting forth penalties to be imposed on individuals who decline to purchase health care coverage by: (1) lowering the maximum penalty amount from $495 to $325 in 2015 and from $750 to $695 in 2016; and (2) increasing the penalty rates based on taxpayer household income for taxable years beginning in 2014 and 2015 and for taxable years beginning after 2015.\n\n(Sec. 1003) Revises the provisions setting forth penalties to be imposed on employers with 50 or more employees who decline to offer employees health care coverage to allow an exemption for the first 30 employees (including part-time employees) when calculating the penalty.

  "latent_20622": "SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) — California’s attorney general said Friday that she was pursuing new pimping charges against the operators of Backpage.com, a website that advertises escort services, just two weeks after a judge tossed an earlier case.\n\nKamala Harris, an incoming U.S. senator, said she has charged Backpage executives Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey and James Larkin with 13 counts of pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. They also are charged with 26 counts of money laundering.\n\nHarris said the new charges are based on new evidence. They come after a Sacramento County judge threw out pimping charges against the men on Dec. 9, citing federal free-speech laws.\n\nIn the latest case, filed in Sacramento County Superior Court, Harris claims Backpage illegally funneled money through multiple companies and created various websites to get around banks that refused to process transactions.\n\nShe also alleged that the company used photos of women from Backpage on other sites without their permission to increase revenue and knowingly profited from the proceeds of prostitution.\n\n“By creating an online brothel — a hotbed of illicit and exploitative activity — Carl Ferrer, Michael Lacey, and James Larkin preyed on vulnerable victims, including children, and profited from their exploitation,” Harris said in a statement.\n\nJim Grant, a lawyer for the three defendants, said the charges rehash the earlier case that was dismissed.\n\n“AG Harris admitted in 2013 that her office cannot bring state-law charges against Backpage, and the Superior Court’s orders earlier this month confirmed this,” Grant said in an email. “She cannot avoid First Amendment protections, federal law or her obligations to follow the law, although her new complaint is a transparent effort to do exactly that.”\n\nHarris was among 47 state attorneys general who asked Congress in 2013 to help change a provision of the Communications Decency Act that they acknowledged protected Backpage from prosecution. The act protects companies from content posted by third parties.\n\nThe state attorney general is doubling down on pimping charges in her final days before resigning to take her seat in the U.S. Senate.\n\nHarris has alleged that more than 90 percent of Backpage’s revenue — millions of dollars each month — comes from adult escort ads that use coded language and nearly nude photos to offer sex for money.\n\nJudge Michael Bowman sided with lawyers for the executives and the company in a ruling earlier this month, saying the website was engaged in free speech allowed under the Communications Decency Act.\n\nIn the earlier case, Ferrer, 55, Backpage’s CEO, was charged with pimping a minor, pimping and conspiracy to commit pimping. Lacey, 68, and Larkin, 67, both from Arizona, were charged with conspiracy to commit pimping.\n\nLacey and Larkin, the website’s former owners, used to own a chain of alternative newspapers around the country, including the Village Voice in New York City.",
  "latent_20673": "The Constitution No Country for Democrats\n\nBritain's Shame\n\nIn the UK 92 legislators have inherited their seats in the legislature from a relative. When one of them dies, those that remain elect the replacement from other members of the \"aristocracy\". These and other House of Lords legislators are immune from the public will. They are legislators until they die.\n\nBut the Parliamentary Oaths Act effectively bars other citizens from sitting in that same legislature even if elected by the people if they believe in the thoroughly democratic tenets of republicanism that are accepted as the norm from the United States of America to the Republic of India. For the Act allows them to take their seat only if they publicly recant their deeply-held beliefs by swearing a feudal oath of allegiance to the Windsor family. Not to the people. Not to a democratic constitution. Not to their country. But to a family. In Iran you cannot stand for election as president if you oppose the the system of Islamic government. In Britain you cannot sit in Parliament if you oppose monarchy unless you are willing to give up your right to free speech and allow the state to compel you to say what you do not believe.\n\nRepublicans are also barred from serving in the army, air force and judiciary for similar reasons.\n\nMembers of the Windsor family that legislators are expected to swear allegiance to are allowed to veto certain legislative proposals regardless of the wishes of the people.\n\nTo add injury to insult Elizabeth Windsor and her son given vast amounts of the people's money every year.

  "latent_20720": "Hey, if you somehow missed it, Fox Sports laid off a ton of writers last week, part of Jamie Horowitz’s much-debated (no pun intended) pivot to video content. Horowitz has since been fired, though for allegations of sexual harassment, not the wide and varied editorial changes he implemented that seemed to anger just about everyone at Fox, according to our reporting.\n\nSo, now that you’re caught up there, it’s important to look at the kind of problems that this sort of upheaval can cause, especially because Fox still has plenty of live sports on which to report. One of those sports is MMA, where Fox’s UFC deal means they have a vested interest in content relating to the sport.\n\nHowever, predictably, they’re in a bit of a bind when it comes to content generation, because they laid off people who cover it, including Damon Martin.\n\nMartin revealed that last week:\n\nAs I'm sure you've heard by now, I am no longer at FOX Sports and I'm officially a free agent as of today. Let's see what the future brings! — Damon Martin (@DamonMartin) June 27, 2017\n\nA million thanks for the kind words today. From followers, fighters, promoters, managers, etc. Really does mean a lot! #FarfromFinished — Damon Martin (@DamonMartin) June 28, 2017\n\nMartin did continue to work, writing this interview with UFC lightweight contender Tony Ferguson for FloCombat.com, which included this passage:\n\n“I’m not going to rob Khabib of an ass whooping. I will give him that ass whooping,” Ferguson said. “Trust me, he does deserve that beat down by my hands. I’ve made so many more fans by his lame ass attempt to go missing in action. If that dude would have showed up and missed weight, I would have won that belt. That sh*t would have been mine automatically. No reason, no wonder his ass didn’t show up.\n\nThat must have been pretty newsworthy, as it made the rounds online, even being picked up by a certain national outlet:\n\nOh, no. No, no, no, Fox, you can’t do that! Points for the attempt at attribution, tagging Martin and also linking to the site itself, but come on. Someone at Fox told a graphic editor (if they still have those) to make up that image, using an interview Martin did for another site, and then just tweeted it out. There’s no attribution in the image itself, either, just the tweet.\n\nAgain, Martin was laid off just last week! Fox can’t even go one week without needing the kind of content they were previously able to generate in house. But hey, they apparently think they’ve found a loophole, where they can just take Martin’s work without paying him for it.\n\nIt’s a real tight ship they’re running over there.

  "latent_21252": "WASHINGTON, June 29 (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump will meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin at a summit of world economic powers in Germany next week in their first ever encounter, a top U.S. official said on Thursday.\n\nWhite House National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster told reporters that no agenda has yet been set for the meeting at the summit of G20 nations in Hamburg.\n\nAllegations that Russia interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and colluded with Trump’s campaign have overshadowed the businessman’s unexpected victory and have dogged his first five months in office.\n\nThe two nations are also at odds over the civil war in Syria where Moscow supports President Bashar al-Assad. The United States backs rebel groups trying to overthrow Assad, and Washington angered Russia by launching missile strikes against a Syrian government air base in April.\n\nGerman Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel told Putin on Thursday that Germany hoped to bring him together with Trump at the summit.\n\nEarlier, the Kremlin said Putin and Trump would meet on the sidelines of the G20 summit, but no separate talks were planned. “They will meet in any case there, on the sidelines of this summit, but no (separate) meeting is planned at the moment,” Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters.\n\nOn Wednesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said it would “probably not be right” if Putin and Trump did not talk at the summit.",
  "latent_21376": "The American Meteor Society has received over 300 reports about a bright fireball over San Antonio Texas Saturday night at approximately 8:45 local time or 2:45 Universal Time. Witnesses reported an extremely bright green light that rivaled the brightness of the sun. Bill Cooke (Meteoroid Environments Office Lead / NASA) were able to estimate the peak brightness at >-14 (stellar magnitude), which means this meteor was at least four feet wide, weighed about 4,000 pounds and burned five times brighter than a full moon.\n\nYou might ask how an object so small can create such a bright flash and be seen over such a wide area? The answer is the extreme velocity at which these objects strike the atmosphere. Even the slowest meteors strike the atmosphere at a velocity of 10 miles per SECOND. The videos of this object (see below) show a meteor moving at an impressive speed so the actual velocity could have been twice this speed. These objects also become visible while at least 60 miles altitude so they can be seen over a wide swath of land.\n\nBelow is a 3D trajectory computed from the witness reports.\n\nHere is a video of the fireball caught during a concert in Austin TX\n\nHere is a video of the fireball taken from a dashboard camera:\n\nThe amazing picture below has been taken by John Gutierrez – www.Anticipationvideos.com (Canon 70D – Sigma 17-50mm lens, ISO 3200, f/6.3, 1/160 second diffused flash). John said: “Just what are the chances that when pressing on the shutter button while photographing the Solero Latin Band a falling star appears, a meteor? I had just focused my camera looking through the viewfinder of the Salero Latin Band playing at Dia de los Muertos in Round Rock tonight, and just when I began to press the shutter button, this falling meteor appears. What makes this photo so interesting is that it made a perfect backdrop for the band while playing rather than an empty dark sky. At first I thought it was a firework, but they don’t fall at that speed. (…) Definitely a shot of a lifetime!”\n\nBelow is the heat map of the witnesses of this event.\n\nFor more information about fireball meteors see the AMS Fireball FAQ. If you witnessed this event please fill out an official fireball report.\n\nHere is another video of the fireball taken from a dashboard camera:\n\nMike Hankey Mike Hankey is a software developer, entrepreneur, amateur astronomer, astrophotographer, meteor observer and meteorite hunter. Mike's enthusiasm for meteors led him to the American Meteor Society where he volunteered his time and the services of his software development company to redesign the AMS website and fireball reporting tool. In 2011 Mike was awarded the society's C.P. Olivier award for his work. In 2012 Mike was promoted to the role of Operations Manager.

  "latent_21639": "Another muggy but eventful Day Four of camp. Let’s get right to the notes.\n\n– Injury roundup. Some good news, some bad news. Xavier Grimble and Roosevelt Nix returned to practice and participated in full. Ben Roethlisberger returned from his day off.\n\nExpected roster move shuffling. The Steelers signed center Valerian Ume-Ezeoke and running back Christian Powell, replacing Quinton Schooley (left leg) and Brandon Johnson (undisclosed). No surprise that Schooley was ushered out – injury looked pretty serious and the team was down to just 13 linemen.\n\nPowell, a RB who was a UDFA by the team and cut out of rookie minicamp, participated in 11 on 11’s. Ume-Ezeoke did not. He jogged onto the field at 3:25, shook some coaches’ hands, and immediately jumped into the stretch line. Life in the NFL.\n\nAs Mike Tomlin indicated, Senquez Golson left on a cart today with a foot injury. I didn’t even see the injury happen so he must have been able to get off the field and to the cart under his own power. Sean Davis replaced him in the slot.\n\nJarvis Jones was sick and was not around today.\n\nHe also said Mandel Dixon and James Harrison got dinged up.\n\nDevaunte Sigler, Ladarius Green, and Shakim Phillips all ran sprints on the middle field early in practice. Green was moving pretty good and then he ran routes at half-speed later in practice. Encouraging signs but of course, no official timetable for their return.\n\n– We might have a riff in our thought-to-be training camp BFFs. Demarcus Ayers and Levi Norwood came down together, Markus Wheaton right behind them, while Sammie Coates made his way down with Sean Davis. The saga begins.\n\n– Ray Vinopal and Jacob Hagen got in a little bit of work, sparring with one another before practice. Worked on their punch off the line of scrimmage.\n\n– Ryan Harris predictably was inserted back into the lineup with the starters.\n\n– The second team offensive line: Alejandro Villanueva-B.J. Finney-Cody Wallace-Chris Hubbard-Jerald Hawkins\n\n– Return line still the status quo. Eli Rogers, Norwood, Wheaton and Ayers.\n\n– With the kick return guys mixed in, Sammie Coates and Roosevelt Nix won the day with five footballs caught at one time. Always a crowd pleaser. Didn’t think Nix had it in him.\n\n– More kick return drill notes. Artie Burns had trouble finding the football, turning too late and being unable to get square to the football. Brandon Brown-Dukes had two drops as Tomlin watched over the group.\n\n– Cam Heyward again said Happy Birthday to DeAngelo Williams and the team sang to him. I hope that’s a daily occurrence.\n\n– Garrett Giemont stretches out Antonio Brown every day. Brown’s leg bends as a 90 degree angle. It’s pretty crazy to see how flexible he is. I don’t think it’s physically possible for him to pull a hamstring.\n\n– Wide receivers got some work today on stalk blocks in addition to running routes on air.\n\n– The “first” group of WRs is still the same. The usual suspects plus Rogers and Norwood. Ayers still with the second group.\n\n– Receivers were catching fades on air with Ben calling “ball” to alert the receiver to get his head around. Norwood looked early once and Ben called him on it.\n\n“You looked early, you cheater!”\n\n– Some special teams notes. Danny Smith getting after Grimble and Coates in drills. Working on splitting the wedge, Grimble was too square to the blockers, causing Smith to stop things, explain it to the tight end, and make him go again.\n\n“You’ll get four hands on you [if you’re square]. The only chance I got is is *turns body to show him splitting the defenders*”\n\nAnd to Coates, a slightly different drill with the coverage unit supposed to rip outside the blockers. Coates was turned ripping out, not square.\n\n“If I come out square, I’m a two way player. If I turn, I’m a one-way player.”\n\n– Two brief 7 on 7 notes. Darrius Heyward-Bey toasted Burns down the left sideline and Grimble had another easy drop.\n\n– We have some WR/DB one-on-ones to go through. So let’s get to it.\n\n1. Heyward-Bey turns late (or the ball was early) and a curl screeches through his hands. Coverage was against Mike Mitchell.\n\n2. Eli Rogers runs a quick out against Montell Garner and makes a simple grab. Rogers looks to turn upfield but Garner grabs the back of his jersey to stop him.\n\n3. Donald Washington is aggressive in his press off the line but Coates is able to swap hips and run vertically. Washington gets caught up in Coates’ feet and falls to the ground ten yards in, leaving Coates to make an easy catch.\n\n4. Doran Grant makes a nice play on a Norwood in-breaking route, punching the ball out from behind.\n\n5. Issac Blakeney does a nice job to break down and work back to the football, hauling in the throw against Al-Hajj Shabazz.\n\n6. Senquez Golson has tight coverage on Ayers all the way but Ayers makes a diving grab on an out route. Ayers has solid hands and makes tough catches.\n\n7. Robert Golden is giving a cushion versus Marcus Tucker but the young receiver fails to get his head around in time and the pass is incomplete.\n\n8. Canaan Severin slipped out of his break on a comeback (the field was a little torn up with all the rain that’s gone through) but makes the catch while going to the ground versus Ray Vinopal.\n\n9. Jordan Dangerfield is all over Norwood, who tries to run a curl, but the safety breaks it up.\n\n10. Ross Ventrone giving a cushion to Issac Blakeney who runs a curl and makes a pretty effortless catch.\n\n11. Antonio Brown beats Artie Burns on a slant and the two juke and dodge their way downfield for another 30 yards.\n\n12. Wheaton burns Washington on a double-move but the pass is overthrown. Still won the route though, and that’s really that matters.\n\n13. Heyward-Bey runs Ross Cockrell off with speed, breaking down and getting separation on a curl. Makes the catch.\n\n14. Montell Garner is all over Rogers the first five yards but once he has to let go, Rogers is able to elude him, darting out and away and making the grab.\n\n15. Grant is all over Coates but the receiver shows strong hands and plucks the ball away, tucking it into his body before Grant is able to make an attempt to pry it out.\n\n16. Sean Davis mirrors Ayers well off the line of scrimmage but Ayers gets away on an out.\n\n17. Blakeney makes a real nice one-handed grab over Shabazz.\n\n18. Norwood beats Washington vertically but the pass is overthrown.\n\n19. Marcus Tucker gains space at the top of his comeback, working away from Golden and reeling the pass in.\n\n20. Severin on an outside release, running a fade and finding the ball against Dangerfield.\n\n21. Blakeney runs a drag against Garner and the pass may have been a bit too far out in front, though Blakeney may also have needed to do a better job of running through his route. Those are the rules. Sit vs zone, run vs man. Either way, the pass is incomplete.\n\n22. Norwood swaps hips with Davis off the line and gives him a little shove upfield as Norwood breaks inward. Gets separation, does everything right…and lets the ball into his chest and drops it. Bummer.\n\n23. AB wins inside versus Ross Cockrell and shields him out on a curl.\n\n24. Wheaton against Burns. Wheaton runs an out route, Burns is all over him and probably a little grabby. Ball thrown away from Burns, Wheaton’s inside shoulder, but the ball goes through his extended fingers.\n\n25. Shabazz is in-phase with DHB, who probably was supposed to break his route off and never did. Ball ends up in the sidelines, incomplete.\n\n26. Eli Rogers runs a slot fade against Garner but those two gets tangled up and Rogers somersaults to the ground.\n\n27. Coates burns Grant down the right side, beats him by a good 2-3 yards.\n\n28. Blakeney again works hard to retrace his steps and work to the QB against Washington. Clean catch.\n\n29. Slot fade to Norwood against Garner. Incomplete but Garner was looking back to the ball too early, losing the hip and giving up separation.\n\n30. Severin makes another sliding catch against Washington.\n\n– OL/DL one-on-one results.\n\n1. Arthur Moats swims inside on Marcus Gilbert. Gilbert lunges and while he’s still able to keep a hand on him, it’s a pretty iffy recovery.\n\n2. David DeCastro absorbs Stephon Tuitt’s bull rush pretty good.\n\n3. Cody Wallace lunges in his punch, whiffing on Daniel McCullers, who rumbles past.\n\n4. Ramon Foster keeps his feet moving and seals off Cam Heyward.\n\n5. Looked like Mike Reilly wins inside against Ryan Harris.\n\n6. Harris gets revenge and seals Reilly upfield.\n\n7. Heyward is loving his outside spin move and tries it on Foster. Able to get some space but Foster keeps himself square and in front. Fun battle.\n\n8. McCullers runs through Wallace.\n\n9. DeCastro in a good hand fight with Tuitt. Wins the battle and it’s pretty spirited.\n\n10. Moats and Gilbert go at it again. Seals Moats initially but Moats works back inside and Gilbert lunges and Moats clears him.\n\n11. Anthony Chickillo rips under Alejandro Villanueva, arguably his biggest weakness in terms of a specific move. Pretty sure Tomlin made an audible “Wow!”\n\n12. Ricardo Mathews’ swims over Wallace.\n\n13. Javon Hargrave makes quick work of Wallace, dipping and ripping under him. Just another guy Hargrave has made look silly.\n\n14. Chris Hubbard seals L.T. Walton.\n\n15. Jerald Hawkins is leaning a little bit but is able to mirror Travis Feeney outside and then inside. Would give the nod to the tackle on this rookie-on-rookie showdown.\n\n16. The coaches want to see them go at it again. Hawkins has a nice kickslide, buolds his house, and gives a hard shove into Feeney up the edge, sending the linebacker belly-flopping into the Earth. Really nice rep from Hawkins.\n\n17. Hubbard uses his hop step to handle Lavon Hooks’ bull rush.\n\n18. Strong punch from Hargrave, which knocks Wallace off his base and into the pocket. Late recovery and I’d give Hargrave the “W” again.\n\n19. Roy Philon can’t rip under B.J. Finney, who gets his hands into Philon’s armpit and rides him upfield.\n\n20. Anthony Chickillo’s bullrush is absorbed by Alejandro Villanueva.\n\n21. A wild Jordan Zumalt appears! He clubs and wins inside against Brian Mihalik.\n\n22. Caushaud Lyons rips through Matt Feiler.\n\n23. Cole Manhart sticks and wins the rep against Johnny Maxey.\n\n– My 11 on 11 notes. Full contact early, eased off in the later sessions.\n\nFirst Session\n\n1. Seven shots. McCullers and Walton in nickel. Nothing immediately available for Ben Roethlisberger who is flushed to his right. Antonio Brown works left to right and in the back of the end zone. Ben finds and hits him.\n\n2. Defensive line of Walton-Hargrave-Mathews. Empty set with Roosevelt Nix, Le’Veon Bell, and David Johnson all split out. Nix flares into the left flat and Ben hits him.\n\n3. 11 personnel with Xavier Grimble at tight end. Bell motioned to empty. Ben finds Grimble in center left field of the end zone, who jumps and makes the grab.\n\n4. Empty again with DeAngelo Williams in the slot. Clean pocket provided for Brown who throws a zinger to Brown, catching it between Shamarko Thomas and a closing-in Artie Burns.\n\n5. Bruce Gradkowski in. Paul Lang and Johnson at TE. Norwood and Coates the receivers. Gradkowski never sees Anthony Chickillo and throws it right between the 5 and the 6. Easy INT.\n\n6. Defense overload pressure to the right. Gradkowski hits Rogers on a slant.\n\n7. Handoff to Fitzgerald Toussaint, makes one player miss but is crushed by several gold jerseys in front of the goal line.\n\nSecond Session\n\n1. Third team defensive line of Maxey-Philon-Lyons in against the first-team offensive line. Toussaint gets the carry. Not sure who had the tackle but Timmons had a nice run fill, forcing Toussaint down a gap.\n\n2. Hargrave and Mathews in their nickel spots. Another dive to Toussaint, Ryan Shazier makes an ankle tackle.\n\n3. William Gay and Ross Cockrell the outside cornerbacks. James Harrison doing Harrison-like things, forcing the ball inside, tossing aside Jesse James, and making the tackle on Brandon Brown-Dukes. One of those plays I wish you could’ve been there to see.\n\n4. Harrison again forces the ball inside and L.J. Fort screams through for a big hit on poor Daryl Richardson.\n\n5. Daniel McCullers clogs up the middle and Richardson bounces his run to the left. Wheaton seals Burns inside, giving the back the perimeter, and Richardson rips off the first big gain of camp, a solid 15 yard or so pickup down the left sideline.\n\n6. Power run with David DeCastro pulling. Burns does better this time, shedding Coates and setting the edge. Cameron Stingily cuts upfield and inside Burns, scurrying downfield before Sharks clocks him along the left sideline.\n\n7. FB dive to Rosie Nix who gets a couple yards and some hooping and hollering from his teammates.\n\n8. *Looked* like another give to Nix but it basically didn’t matter. Ricardo Mathews knifes into the backfield for another TFL. He’s had a solid camp.\n\n“Good job Ricardo!” a player or coach calls out.\n\n9. Landry Jones fires a corner route to Eli Rogers. Tight coverage. Rogers jumps for it but Jordan Dangerfield breaks it up on the way down.\n\nClean pocket provided to Jones, led by Finney picking up a twist or a linemen scraping over.\n\n10. Inside zone to Toussaint to the left side, cutting off the tight end’s inside hip. Gets a couple yards before Ross Ventrone flies in to hit him. Steven Johnson helped out, too.\n\n11. Playaction. Jones hits Grimble down the right seam, wide open. Grimble runs another five or so yards until Ventrone gets brave and goes low on the tight end. Grimble runs over him, stumbling past before Garner drags him down.\n\n12. Split zone with Christian Powell getting the carry. Dangerfield darts in and smacks him good. Welcome back, Powell. Instead of a casserole, you get popped in the ear-hole.\n\n13. Third-team offensive line: Mihalik-Manhart-Finney-Feiler-Hawkins. Pistol and the give is to Richardson. He shows nice burst through the hole before Vince Williams makes the tackle.\n\n14. Stingily runs through McCullers attempted tackle, only grazing him, until Shabazz and a couple others make the tackle.\n\n15. Brown-Dukes gets the carry but there’s no room to go. Tyler Matakevich sweeps the leg and knocks BBD’s feet from out under him in the backfield.\n\nThird Session\n\n– Defense worked exclusively with their fire zones this period.\n\n1. DL of Walton/McCullers/Mathews. Empty set. Ben Roethlisberger, Lang/Nix in the rep. Golden blitzes. Big Ben flips a throw to Bell in the left flat, James Harrison dropping and shoving him out of bounds.\n\n2. Sean Davis in the slot, replacing Senquez Golson. Came blitzing from his nickel spot. Ben fires a dig right into Brown’s hands over the middle.3\n\n3. Ben throws short to Wheaton, working against Gay, but the pass glances off the receiver’s hands. 50/50 if you want to call it a drop.\n\n4. 11 personnel. DeCastro handled Heyward’s bull rush well. Ben checks down to D-Will.\n\n5. Chickillo rushes free off the defense’s left side. Gradkowski hits Coates on a curl in the face of the blitz. Nice read. Quick decision. Make a profit. World keeps spinning.\n\n6. Jones looks to fire out hot to the left side but I think Timmons bats it down.\n\n7. Fire X with Matakevich and Johnson crossing each other, Matakevich coming free. Jones hits an open Norwood running a shallow cross right to left.\n\n8. Garner now seeing time in the slot against Eli Rogers. Chickillo runs through Paul Lang like he isn’t even there. Jones finds Rogers on a crossing route.\n\n9. Sean Davis pitted against AB in the slot. Both the nickel player – Davis – and LCB – Garner – rush. That might be a new fire zone. Ben finds AB over the middle, who takes off across the field and down the right sideline. Ventrone and Mike Reilly give chase the whole way to the end zone and DHB plays bouncer for AB, all four sprinting down the right side.\n\nTomlin to AB as he jogs back. “Way to finish 8-4!”\n\n10. Roethlisberger complete to Grimble, who plucks this one off Shazier’s helmet. Nice play.\n\n11. Ben flare right to D-Will. Little bit in front but it hits off the back’s hands. Again, 50/50 if you want to classify that as a drop.\n\n12. Mihalik in at right tackle with the 2nd team offensive line. LB fire zone and Gradkowski repeats what he did on an earlier rep, tossing a short curl to Coates. Grant was playing off coverage.\n\n13. Empty set. Quick throw to Toussaint in the left flat.\n\n14. Hawkins at right tackle. Ayers in the slot with Norwood and Blakeney outside. CB blitz off the left side. Gradkowski’s arm may have been hit, the pass fluttering out and to the ground after a couple yards.\n\n15. Gradkowski looks for Norwood on a slant but the two can’t connect and the pass falls incomplete.\n\nFourth Session\n\n1. Playaction. Brown works back to Big Ben and the two hook up. Mike Mitchell was late getting there and he yelled out a certain four letter word in frustration.\n\n2. LB again pulled off the line, Moats, giving that 4-3 look with tilted nose. Ben checkdown to Bell, a non-contact drill, so Bell is back in.\n\n3. Playaction again but a receiver fell down trying to make his break on a dig. So Ben smartly checks it to Nix. Shazier pulls him down.\n\n4. Roethlisberger again finds Nix. Pass is a tad behind but the fullback makes the catch.\n\n5. Davis checks in at safety with Garner in the slot but Rogers motions to his side, causing the rookie to slide down over the WR. Roethlisberger fires to Coates. Burns has solid coverage. Both lay out for it and the pass is wide, incomplete.\n\n6. Ben checks again to Bell. Chickillo initially tried to win with speed against Harris and countered nicely with a spin, finally shaking him. Chickillo had a quietly good day.\n\n7. Toussaint with the carry through the hole. Burns did a nice job as the force defender to the defense’s right side, keeping the back between the tackles. Toussaint goes up the gut and is met by a thud by Shamarko Thomas.\n\n8. Looks like a rub route with Coates and Lang. Burns has trouble working through Lang and Coates is wide open on a dig, making an easy catch.\n\n9. Landry Jones checks to Richardson. Reilly gives good chase and Ventrone two-hand tags the back.\n\n10. Jones hits David Johnson on a crossing pattern. He and Shazier make the catch simultaneously falling to the ground and Johnson wrestling the football away.\n\n11. Toss to the right to Brown-Dukes. Lyons chases the ball across the field and pops him pretty good.\n\n12. Norwood in the slot, Blakeney and Coates on the outside. Davis lined up in the slot. Post/dig concept, Davis carrying the seam that opens up Blakeney on the dig. Dustin Vaughan finds him.\n\n13. Finney in a third team center. Nothing open for several seconds and then McCullers collapses the pocket, serving as an lunar eclipse for Vaughan. Just trying to get the ball out, Vaughan chucks it to Stingily underneath. The pass is off the mark and incomplete.\n\n14. Moats rips under Mihalik off the edge. Marcus Tucker is open but Vaughan’s throw goes right through his hands. McCullers dropped into coverage on Brown-Dukes in the flats and that made me smile.\n\n15. Draw to Powell who steps out of Matakevich’s tackle before getting tackled elsewhere near the LOS.\n\nFifth Session\n\n1. My favorite play of the day. Power run with DeCastro and Johnson pulling. DeCastro kicks out Arthur Moats and Johnson does the same to Ryan Shazier. Bell follows them right on through. Well executed.\n\n2. Toss left to Williams. He cuts upfield and Robert Golden fills the alley. His run fills are consistently excellent.\n\n3. Looked like a low snap. Flare from Ben to Bell.\n\n4. Davis in the slot. Handoff to Bell, who finds a lane and is tripped up at the second level.\n\n5. Roethilsberger with a little flick of the wrist, throwing from the far hash to the left sideline, hitting AB on an out route. Travis Feeney can’t get enough depth to contest the throw.\n\n6. Garner in the slot, Davis at safety. Ben complete to Rogers on a pivot rough to the sideline.\n\n7. Power again to the right. Toussaint the carry, DeCastro and Johnson the lead blockers.\n\n8. Another carry to Toussaint. Reilly a nice job as a force defender and the back cuts inside and upfield.\n\n9. Tyler Matakevich lined up at OLB, stacked with a teammate, dropping into coverage as the overhang defender and driving on Landry Jones’ throw to Daryl Richardson in the flat.\n\n10. DL trio of Maxey-Hooks-Newberry. Another checkdown from Jones to Richardson. Timmons wraps him up with a soft tackle. Newberry had a nice contain rush.\n\n11. Playaction and the team false keys by pulling the guard. Maybe Marcus Tucker thought it was supposed to be a run because he never gets his head around. Ventrone reads it a lot better and dives for Jones’ throw, nearly coming away with it. Lost it on the way to the ground.\n\n12. Vaughan flips a screen left to Brown-Dukes. He jets away from Vince Williams. Dangerfield taps him up.\n\nTomlin yells out, “Get on out of there, Mercyhurst!” Still calling him by his college, not his name.\n\n13. Vaughan flips the run away from the creeping safety. Looked like McCullers tracked down Brown-Dukes.\n\n14. Power run but Matt Feiler can’t log Steven Johnson to the inside. Brown-Dukes is able to work away from the linebacker, breaking left and downfield. Gains about 6-7 yards before being tackled by Garner.\n\n15. Vaughan flare route to Powell to end things.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\n1. Doran Grant may not be the talk of the day but he played better. Even on the catches he gave up, his coverage was tight.\n\n2. Xavier Grimble continues to flash as a receiver. And he was able to finish practice today which might be the best news.\n\n3. Jerald Hawkins had a strong day in one-on-ones. Took care of Feeney.\n\n4. Ricardo Mathews keeps making plays in the backfield. Versatile, can play in base and nickel, and he’s been disruptive all around.\n\n5. Tyler Matakevich was as active as I’ve seen him all camp. Maybe things are slowing down for him a bit.\n\n6. Anthony Chickillo a really good day, building on what he did yesterday. Again, I don’t think he headlines things but whenever I watched him, he won as a pass rusher and had today’s lone INT.\n\n7. Team gave Brandon Brown-Dukes quite a bit of burn today, especially in the final rep. Tomlin said nice things about him.\n\n8. On the bad side of things, Marcus Tucker had a rough one. A drop and a miscommunication for a guy not getting a ton of reps won’t help his chances.\n\n9. Artie Burns was better but still up-and-down. It’s a long process though.\n\n10. Four days in and I thought I’d see Donald Washington pop a little more than he has. A little disappointing, I guess.\n\nTwitter Question Of The Day\n\nhttps://twitter.com/SHarralson/status/760266529493573632\n\nHe’s done some nice things.

  "latent_21654": "Obama's two-year 'amnesty' for illegal immigrant minors sparks TWELVE-FOLD spike in numbers pouring across border\n\nA San Antonio Air Force base, a California Navy base, and a makeshift detention center in Nogales, Arizona have become temporary shelters for children and youths caught crossing the border without their parents\n\nRepublicans blame the Obama administration for the problem, citing a 2012 policy that relaxed deportations\n\nIt's 'an administration-made disaster,' says the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee\n\nPresident Obama now concedes that it's an 'urgent humanitarian situation' and is setting aside $2 million to pay lawyers for the children\n\nThe US government expects as many as 80,000 child immigrants to illegally enter the US this year, a twelve-fold jump in just three years\n\nMore than 33,000 have been picked up in Texas since October; the Arizona facility has ordered 2,000 mattresses to handle its overload\n\n'Instead of having an application of the immigration law, we are taking mothers and children and dumping them,' another claimed\n\nA federal judge castigated the Obama administration in December, saying it was 'completing the criminal mission' of human traffickers\n\nPresident Barack Obama is calling tens of thousands of illegal-immigrant children languishing in temporary U.S. holding pens an 'urgent humanitarian situation,' but Republicans are pointing the finger of blame squarely at the White House.\n\nObama instituted an immigration policy that the GOP says enticed tens of thousands of Central American children to cross America's southern border illegally without any parents to guide them.\n\nMore than 33,000 have been picked up in Texas alone since October. The U.S. border patrol says its forces are overwhelmed, and the courts are bracing for a flood of immigration cases from children held in temporary detention facilities designed to handle a fraction of the numbers. Sanitation problems are beginning to rear their ugly heads.\n\nObama rolled out a controversial Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program in 2012, allowing many illegal immigrants who came to the U.S. as minors to escape deportation for two years. The White House gave them another two-year window last week.\n\nAs a result, say some GOP leaders, America's system for handling illegal immigration has been strained to the breaking point and is attracting hundreds of new illegal-immigrant children every day.\n\nCompared to the year before Obama's policy took effect, twelve times as many kids are coming north illegally this year.\n\nOverflowing: The shelter at Lackland Air Force Base in Texas can no longer accommodate large numbers of children and mothers traveling with their kids, forcing the federal government to open more facilities and move many to Nogales for processing\n\nHundreds of immigrants believed to be in the country illegally from Central America and Mexico being held in crowded concrete rooms similar to a jail cell\n\nMany of the children appear to be teenagers but some clearly are younger\n\nLackland has become a temporary shelter for youths caught crossing the border illegally and alone\n\nA half-century-old section of a U.S. Air Force base in Texas is now a holding and processing center for thousands of children who managed to enter the U.S. alone. The same is true of a Navy base in California.\n\nAnd a makeshift detention center in Arizona holding 700 illegal immigrant children has ordered 2,000 mattresses to keep up with an expected influx in the coming months.\n\nJudge: US 'has simply chosen not to enforce ... border security laws' In a landmark court ruling in December, a federal judge ruled against the Department of Homeland Security for releasing a Salvadoran girl to her mother. The mom had hired a smuggler to transport her daughter into the U.S., and was herself in the country illegally. U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen wrote that 'this court is quite concerned with the apparent policy of the Department of Homeland Security of completing the criminal mission of those who are violating the border security of the United States.' 'The DHS,' Hanen added, 'should enforce the laws of the United States – not break them.'\n\nMany of the children there were sleeping on plastic boards.\n\nAccording to the Associated Press, toothbrushes and toothpaste hadn't arrived yet and were expected Monday.\n\nHundreds of children had not bathed in days, and were taking turns using just four showers.\n\nTony Banegas, Honduras’ honorary consul in Phoenix, told the AP that there were 236 Honduran children there on Saturday, including an 8-year-old.\n\nRepublicans on Capitol Hill are beyond angry.\n\nLeaked photos from the base, which were obtained by the Breitbart.com news blog, show hundreds of children holed up in crowded concrete rooms, many of them sleeping on the bare floor without blankets or pillows.\n\n'The recent surge of children and teenagers from Central America showing up at our southern border is an administration-made disaster,' Virginia GOP Rep. Bob Goodlatte, who chairs the House Judiciary Committee, told Fox News last week.\n\nPoll Should Obama's two-year 'amnesty' for illegal immigrant minors crossing the border be abolished?

Paul Gosar, who sits on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Friday that 'instead of having an application of the immigration law, we are taking mothers and children and dumping them ... and violating the rule[s] over and over.'\n\nPolicy shift: President Barack Obama announced on June 15, 2012 that the U.S. would stop deporting young illegal immigrants who satisfied a broad set of criteria; the move has enticed tens of thousands of children to sneak across the border even though the policy doesn't apply to them Immediately contentious: Neil Munro (C), the White House Correspondent for the Daily Caller, peppered Obama with unexpected questions during the announcement, during which the president hadn't planned to take questions at all\n\nAt the base, children are provided with three hot meals and two snacks a day. They can call home twice a week. They have access to mental health clinicians and on-site medical care\n\nThe minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala\n\nThe Obama administration expects as many as 80,000 of these 'unaccompanied minors' to cross the border in 2014, according to the Christian Science Monitor.\n\nThat number is twelve times what it was in 2011, the year before Obama announced his deferred-action plan.\n\nThe administration now estimates the holding facilities where the youngsters are being held cost taxpayers $252 per child per day, far more than the cost of a hotel and more than the children could expect to earn in two weeks of hard work picking crops, work that many were slated to do.\n\nFacing the question of whether to deport the minors or play a game of catch-and-release, the administration has set aside $2 million to pay for their lawyers.\n\n'We're taking a historic step to strengthen our justice system and protect the rights of the most vulnerable members of society,' Attorney General Eric Holder said Friday in a statement.\n\n'How we treat those in need, particularly young people who must appear in immigration proceedings – many of whom are fleeing violence, persecution, abuse or trafficking – goes to the core of who we are as a nation.'\n\nObama's 'deferred action' program for minors, which he announced in a fanfare-laden June 15, 2012 Rose Garden press conference, applies only to children who came to America before mid-2007.\n\n'It makes no sense to expel talented young people, who, for all intents and purposes, are Americans,' the president said then.\n\nAmerica has been left astounded by the shocking conditions these children have been kept in - conditions so dire that border control agents fear the spread of disease\n\nAbout 850 that were being housed at the facility have been released to a vetted family member or a sponsor\n\nRepublicans blame President Obama for the situation, pointing to his 2012 policy that sent a message of hope to kids yearning to stay in the U.S.\n\nPhotos leaked Thursday from a U.S. Border Patrol facility in the Rio Grande Valley show overflowing holding facilities of immigrants, many of whom are children Over 400 children a day are coming and as many as 60,000 will cross the Mexican border illegally this year\n\nBut Capitol Hill is rife with fears that the message was garbled by the time it reach Guatemala, Honduras and other countries where poverty runs rampant. Many children traveling north on their own hope the policy will include them.\n\nThat's what 'coyotes,' the smugglers who bring them in, are telling them to expect, according to Tania Chavez, a representative with La Union del Pueblo Entero, told KRGV-TV. in southern Texas.\n\nThe minors flooding over the border are often teenagers leaving behind poverty or violence in Mexico and other parts of Central America such as Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala.\n\nWith the president traveling in Europe last week, there have been no press briefings at the White House where questions might be put to outgoing press secretary Jay Carney.\n\nBut Obama met privately Monday morning with a group of nurses from across the country 'to discuss the importance of passing commonsense immigration reform,' according to the White House.\n\nThe Associated Press reported Monday that in a May 30 memo to the National Security Council's transborder security directorate, Border Patrol Deputy Chief Ronald Vitiello warned that the influx of unexpected illegals has stretched the border patrol beyond reason.\n\nBut releasing them or reuniting them with family members in the United States would serve as 'incentives to additional individuals to follow the same path.'\n\nPresident Barack Obama said the sharp influx of unaccompanied children from Honduras, El Salvador and Guatemala was an 'urgent humanitarian situation'\n\nMore than 33,000 minors were apprehended in the Rio Grande Valley of Texas since October last year, it has been reported\n\nRepublicans angered about the situation point to a federal judge who castigated the Obama administration for relaxing its immigration policy and encouraging human traffickers.\n\nIn a December ruling, U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen ripped the Department of Homeland Security for releasing a Salvadoran girl to her mother – a woman who had hired a smuggler to transport her daughter into the U.S., and was herself in the country illegally.\n\nHanen wrote that 'this court is quite concerned with the apparent policy of the Department of Homeland Security of completing the criminal mission of those who are violating the border security of the United States.'\n\n'The DHS,' he added, 'should enforce the laws of the United States – not break them.'\n\nIn a related case, the El Paso Times reported Monday that a Catholic charity was assisting 130 illegal immigrant children flown to El Paso, Texas.\n\nMany were traveling with their parents when they were apprehended trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nOne Guatemalan woman named Maria, who enter the United States with her two children, told the Times that she wanted to go to Tennessee to reunite with her sister.\n\nImmigration officials, she said, had released her from custody and let her travel north.",
  "latent_21702": "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Close-Up: Poland's knight obsession\n\nThere is something about summer that makes some Poles clamour to slip into chain mail or flowing dresses and pretend to be medieval knights and damsels.\n\nDuring the holiday season there is a knights' tournament or battle re-enactment every weekend.\n\n\"People love it. They want to be some somewhere far, far away from the normal, just a little bit boring, everyday life,\" says popular historian Boguslaw Woloszanski.\n\nWhen I used to do this I broke my hand 14 times and I'm a banjo player Krzysztof Ptasinski, Combat judge\n\n\"We are a very romantic nation, and knights and the medieval time is so romantic.\"\n\nMr Woloszanski was taking a break from directing the preparations for the staging of the re-enactment of a siege of Malbork Castle, Europe's largest lowland castle.\n\nThe massive red brick fortress dates from 1274 and was the Prussian stronghold of the Teutonic Knights.\n\nAfter a combined Polish and Lithuanian army defeated the knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410, they laid siege to the castle for more than two months.\n\n\"It's the best time in Polish history. Our history was very cruel especially during World War II and afterwards under communism,\" Mr Woloszanski says.\n\n\"But 600 years ago it was the most beautiful time, when Poland was a really powerful state.\"\n\nAt its height in the 15th and 16th Centuries, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth ruled an area stretching from the Baltic to the Black Sea.\n\nDisplaced kidney\n\nMalbork Castle is the site in modern Poland, about 240km (150 miles) north-west of the capital Warsaw, which symbolises that era of bravery and chivalry.\n\nThe siege, which actually ended in failure, is re-enacted for a paying audience of several thousand people over three nights.\n\nThere are also archery, crossbow, jousting and combat competitions during the four-day festival, and as many as 10,000 tourists come to watch.\n\nBut it is not just for tourists.\n\nHundreds of Poles, who all belong to regional Knights' Brotherhoods, are taking part - sleeping in cone-shaped tents in three separate knights' camps around the castle walls.\n\nCompering and judging the hand-to-hand combat is Krzysztof Ptasinski, the son of a Polish diplomat who learnt English from an American teacher in Addis Ababa and insists I call him \"Redneck Chris\".\n\nHis hooded robe and summer gear make him look like a monk in flip-flops.\n\nI do it because it's fun... You have to be good at riding and handy with the equipment Ewa Jarzabek, Horse skills competitor\n\n\"Whoa dude! Ouch! In your face!\" he hollers as two knights wearing full body-plate armour weighing 35kg (77lb) lay into each other with double-handed swords.\n\nTo progress, a knight has to reach five points, each earned by laying a clean blow on an opponent above the knee.\n\nThe swords are blunt, of course, but that does not mean it is completely harmless.\n\n\"When I used to do this I broke my hand 14 times, and I'm a banjo player,\" he says.\n\n\"I've got two screws in this finger. I had a cracked skull.\n\n\"When we were fighting the Belarusian guys, I had my kidney displaced.\"\n\nI ask him what the appeal is.\n\n\"Whenever you get hit in the helmet you almost lose consciousness because it's so loud. It's a thrill,\" he says.\n\nIn the ring\n\nThe only way to find out, he adds, is to try it for myself.\n\nSomewhat recklessly, it transpires later, I agree and after three people have helped me into my leggings, leg and arm armour, chain mail vest, and dog-faced helmet, I am almost ready to fall over.\n\nImage caption The siege of Malbork Castle is re-enacted over three nights\n\nMr Ptasinski's friend, Damian Debski, agrees to show me a few moves.\n\nInstead of staying over to the side, away from the competition area, he gets me to walk out in front of the crowd and be introduced.\n\nWe are armed with wooden shields and swords and increasingly I am beginning to sense that Mr Debski is not going to show me several slow motion \"air\" lunges, ripostes and attacks as I had initially thought.\n\nInstead someone shouts \"Go\" and he is bearing down on me and almost cleaves my shield in two with his first blow.\n\nI manage to defend myself for quite some time, actually about 10 seconds, before he stops being soft on me and aims a blow to my head, clattering my helmet.\n\n\"Redneck Chris\" was right - it is loud. And it is also tiring.\n\nRealising how glad I was not to have been born in the Middle Ages, I ask Ewa Jarzabek, one of the people taking part in the horse skills, which includes spearing a small hoop with a lance on the gallop, why she does it.\n\n\"I do it because it's fun, it's interesting and it involves horses,\" she says.\n\n\"You have to prepare and you have to be good at it. You have to be good at riding and handy with the equipment. It's challenging.\"\n\nThese events are popular not just in Poland, but across Europe.\n\nIt is difficult to precisely define their attraction - but there can be no doubt that dressing up and getting together with friends at picturesque medieval castles appeals to an awful lot of people.",

  "latent_21859": "Forbes estimates that there are around 500 billionaires in the United States, with about 70% having built their wealth on their own and the other 30% inheriting it. In business, being a tech geek isn't the only path to wealth these days. People have been joining the billionaires list from a number of different industries in the past few years.\n\nSo where will you find these super-rich businesspeople? Read on for a look at the five states with the most billionaires, along with the industries that build wealth in each state. We'll use 2013 data, as Forbes doesn't reveal the full roster of U.S. billionaires until its list of the world's richest comes out in spring.\n\n1. California\n\nThe tech industry has put California at the top of the list, with 111 billionaires. Silicon Valley has created huge amounts of wealth over the years, as its cluster of technology talent constantly attracts even more talent and creates new businesses that upend incumbents and create value from new innovations and technologies.\n\nIn recent years, Facebook (NASDAQ:FB) has been the state's biggest source of billionaires, with Mark Zuckerberg, Dustin Moskovitz, Chris Hughes, Peter Thiel, Sean Parker, and Sheryl Sandberg, among others, making the list. Two more joined the Facebook billionaires' club this year after the company purchased WhatsApp for $19 billion. That purchase made billionaires out of WhatsApp co-founders Jan Koum and Brian Acton.\n\n2. New York\n\nNew York, home to the financial capital of the world, has the second-highest number of billionaire residents, with 88. The state's list is largely made up of financiers and fund managers who built their businesses by helping other people invest their money. Besides David Koch, Michael Bloomberg, and Rupert Murdoch, the list reads like a veritable Who's Who of the investing world: Carl Icahn, George Soros, Stan Druckenmiller, Daniel Loeb, David Einhorn, Nelson Peltz, Bill Ackman, and many others.\n\n3. Texas\n\nTexas, with 51 billionaires, places third. The state's lack of an income tax has probably helped attract billionaires from several industries, but most of the Lone Star State's list is made up of people from the energy industry -- particularly oil and gas pipelines. The richest person in the state is Richard Kinder, whose Kinder Morgan (NYSE:KMI) is the largest pipeline company in the U.S. and plans to get bigger and continue growing its dividend. Other notable energy billionaires include the Duncan Family of Enterprise Products Partners LP (NYSE:EPD), Jefferey Hildebrand of Hilcorp, and shale investor Trevor Rees-Jones.\n\nThere is a motley bunch of other billionaires from Texas, including Dell's Michael Dell, Beal Bank's Andrew Beal, Ross Perot, Jr., Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, and Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones.\n\n4. Florida\n\nLike Texas, Florida lacks an income tax, and that certainly attracts people to the Sunshine State, as do its weather and cost of living. The state claims 37 billionaires, some of whom are homegrown, but many of whom have decided to make Florida their home after making their money elsewhere. Notable Florida billionaires include Wilbur Ross, Sears Holdings' (NASDAQOTH:SHLDQ) Eddie Lampert, Franklin Resources' (NYSE:BEN) Charles Johnson, Carnival's (NYSE:CCL) Micky Arison, Best Buy's (NYSE:BBY) Richard Schulze, Rockstar energy-drink founder Russ Weiner, Subway founder Fred DeLuca, and Wayne Huizenga, founder of Waste Management (NYSE:WM), Blockbuster Video, and AutoNation (NYSE:AN).\n\n5. Illinois\n\nRounding out the top five is Illinois, with 19 billionaires. Finance and real estate moguls top the state's list of billionaires, with Ken Griffin of alternative-investment giant Citadel at No. 1. Guggenheim Partners' Mark Walter and Morningstar's Joe Mansueto are the state's other finance billionaires. In real estate, Sam Zell leads the way in Illinois, with the members of the Pritzker family, founders of Hyatt Hotels (NYSE:H), also making the list.\n\nSlow and steady path to riches\n\nMost of the United States' billionaires became wealthy slowly by building valuable companies in areas that many people find to be boring. One of the great things about America is that you're free to start your own business and compound your investments over time to the point where you, too, can become a billionaire.",
  "latent_22059": "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\nA month ago, as Donald Trump celebrated his victories in seven of the 11 Super Tuesday contests, the real estate mogul’s march toward the Republican presidential nomination appeared all but unstoppable. But at the same time, GOP voters in Colorado were quietly setting in motion a process that now threatens to help derail Trump’s candidacy.\n\nWhile voters in other states registered their support for a presidential candidate, Republicans in Colorado could only vote for county-level delegates. Those county delegates would, in turn, select the delegates who will ultimately choose the party’s nominee at its national convention in Cleveland this summer.\n\nIt’s an arcane process that benefits candidates with support among party activists and a well-oiled campaign machine. But the Trump campaign has largely ignored Colorado’s delegate selection process, which culminates this Saturday in the State Republican Convention in Colorado Springs. As a result, Trump could end up with no delegates from the state. That would be a major blow to his effort to secure the 1,237 delegates necessary to win the nomination—and it could offer a preview of even more setbacks as the race turns into a scramble for sympathetic delegates.\n\nRepublicans involved in Colorado’s delegate selection process have seen no organized effort on Trump’s behalf. “Trump has, from what I can see, zero campaign infrastructure and organization in the state,” says Ryan Call, a former state party chairman. “I have not so much as seen a Trump banner.”\n\n“He will get, in my estimation, zero delegates in Colorado,” adds Call.\n\nAt this point in the race, every delegate is critical. If a candidate reaches 1,237 delegates on the first ballot in Cleveland, that candidate becomes the nominee. But if no one hits 1,237, then delegates will proceed to additional rounds of voting until a candidate hits that magic number. At the start of the convention, most of the delegates will be “bound,” meaning that they will be required to vote for a specific candidate determined by their state’s primary or caucus results. But with each successive round of voting, more delegates will become unbound and will be free to vote for any valid candidate they choose.\n\nOf course, Trump’s campaign is hoping to win an outright majority on the first ballot in Cleveland. But that prospect has grown less likely as Trump has slipped in recent contests and as Ted Cruz has slowly gained on him, increasing the chances of a contested convention where delegates can select the candidate of their choosing.\n\nIf that happens, the process will favor whichever candidate has out-hustled the others at state conventions to ensure that his supporters are selected as delegates. And while Cruz has focused considerable resources on delegate selection, Trump has mainly stayed on the sidelines. He took his first step to compete in the delegate battle late last month when he hired a political operative to oversee his delegate strategy.\n\nThe disparity could have the most immediate effect in Colorado. Republican Party rules require that if a state holds a primary or caucuses in which voters select actual presidential candidates, its delegates must be bound on the first ballot. But Colorado is one of three states that opted not to allow voters to choose among the candidates. As a result, Colorado’s delegates will be unbound and free to choose among the candidates on the first ballot. (The other two states with unbound delegates, Wyoming and North Dakota, send fewer delegates to the national convention. Delegates from Guam, American Samoa, and the US Virgin Islands—and a portion of the delegates from Pennsylvania—are not bound by primary results and can also vote freely on the first ballot.)\n\nBut there’s another twist: Delegates from Colorado become bound if they write the name of their preferred candidate on their intention-to-run form. So a well-organized campaign with loyalty among party activists could control most of Colorado’s delegates on the first ballot. Trump doesn’t have that kind of organization and popularity among party insiders. But Cruz does.\n\n“There’s been a lot of movement toward Cruz as the last man standing,” said Dick Wadhams, a Republican consultant and another former chairman of the Colorado Republican Party.\n\nOn Super Tuesday, which took place on March 1, Republicans in Colorado headed to their local precincts to select delegates to county-level conventions. Those county conventions then sent delegates on to another round of conventions in each of the state’s seven congressional districts. Each district convention chooses three delegates to the national convention—a process that began last week and concludes on Friday. So far, most of the delegates chosen at these conventions have pledged to support Cruz.\n\nOn Saturday, the process will culminate in the state convention, where 13 additional national delegates will be elected from a pool of more than 600. Each potential delegate will get 10 seconds at the microphone to make his or her case. In addition, three party leaders will automatically become unbound national delegates, giving the state a total of 37 delegates in Cleveland. (Call is himself vying for a delegate spot on Saturday, but he is not aligned with any presidential campaign.)\n\nCruz will speak at the state convention on Saturday, while John Kasich and Trump will send surrogates to address the convention. The question is not whether Cruz-pledged delegates will win a majority, but by how much. If Trump’s campaign had invested in delegate-wrangling early on in Colorado, he might not be looking at a potential shutout. Moreover, if Colorado Republicans had held an actual presidential poll at their March 1 caucuses—as most other caucus states did—Trump supporters would likely have turned out to vote for him, and he might have won a significant share of the state’s delegates. “I will always wonder what that did to Trump’s showing in Colorado by not having that poll,” Wadhams says.\n\nColorado’s process is unusual, but it still offers a preview of the trouble that could lie ahead for Trump. If the convention in Cleveland does move beyond the first ballot, it will look a lot like the Colorado process—with the preferences of the individual delegates determining the outcome. And if the outcome in Colorado is any indication, that doesn’t bode well for Trump.",

Fans were adamant that since her body was never seen, it was inevitable that she’d be back, but in an attempt to keep it secret, Moore filmed her return in isolation, and even lied to the cast to avoid fans’ expectations being confirmed.\n\n8) “Ned Stark is totally the main character of Game of Thrones.”\n\nFor fans of George R.R. Martin’s A Song of Ice and Fire, this was a pretty hilarious bit of trickery. Going into the first season of Game of Thrones, Martin was repeatedly quoted as saying that Sean Bean’s Ned Stark was the main character the whole story revolves around—you can see him above saying this in a pre-release featurette for the show. If you weren’t familiar with the books, why wouldn’t you believe the author?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWell, book fans were more than familiar with the fact that Martin was indeed being very specific about the show when he described Ned. He’s technically correct: Ned is the main character... until he gets his head lopped off nine episodes in, much to the shock of new fans. So this was an unconvincing lie, but only to fans who already knew what was really going on.\n\n7) “The Mandarin isn’t in Iron Man 3”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis one is a very weird case. Originally, when rumors started cropping up that one of Tony Stark’s most iconic foes, The Mandarin, would be in the third Iron Man movie, Shane Black flatly denied it—not only did he say the magic and mysticism of the character’s powerset would be considered too outlandish, but the character itself was a racist caricature, and wouldn’t work in the modern age. Inevitably, Marvel revealed that the Mandarin was indeed going to be in the film, as the main threat.\n\nThere was a twist though! The Mandarin wasn’t really in the movie, or even the main villain. The Mandarin persona—already radically different from the comic version—was a ruse adopted by Sir Ben Kingsley’s Trevor Slattery, an actor working for the real villain Aldrich Killian. Because fans are never truly satisfied, this ultimately lead to people being angry that they were deceived by the character being a sham, after first being angry that the character wasn’t going to be in the film at all. Sometimes, you can’t win, no matter what you do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n6) Anything Steven Moffat said about Doctor Who\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIf there’s one thing Steven Moffat’s legacy on Doctor Who will leave as he begins his departure from the show, it’s his nature as the trickster showrunner, a habit he picked up from his predecessor, Russell T Davies—a seemingly wanton glee at denying anything and everything about Doctor Who’s future, only to immediately turn around the moment something is confirmed and say, “Of course I was lying.”\n\nTo be fair, it’d be poor form for a showrunner to up and reveal everything about their upcoming episodes, but it infuriated his detractors—and sometimes the denials were so obviously untrue that it just came off as a little silly. Case in point, heading into Peter Capaldi’s first season, the showrunner was quick to pour water on the constant rumors that The Doctor’s arch-nemesis The Master would return:\n\nNo! I accidentally just said the truth! No, not really. I think the story’s sort of done. I thought what Russell [T. Davies] did with that was so brilliant, because I did think it was over.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnsurprisingly, it wasn’t the truth! Michelle Gomez’s “Missy” was revealed to be The Master at the end of the season, and presumably Moffat cackled maniacally when people got annoyed at him yet again.\n\n5) “Oberhauser Isn’t Blofeld”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLook, when you call your James Bond movie Spectre, there’s going to be certain assumptions about the identity of the villain. Yet, the latest Bond went full throttle in its insistence that Christoph Waltz’s shadowy bad guy was a brand new character, Oberhauser, and not Blofeld, the sinister head of the SPECTRE organization. And yet, rumors persisted, so much so at one point, speaking to Cinemablend, Waltz snapped, and blamed the entire internet for the rumor mongering... and also maybe attempting to take over the world?\n\nFirst of all, on what basis? You know, it’s silly. It’s plain silly…So that’s done with — the Blofeld question. Why would they make a movie that they’ve done before? I’m interested in what you said, ‘The Internet has decided.’ What’s the Internet? The Internet is something like the climate that we can’t influence, that kind of does what it does and we have to adapt to it and, sort of, react accordingly? … The Internet is us. So the Internet in itself doesn’t decide anything. I’m very adamant about that because the Internet takes over as an entity, as an independent entity… That’s why it’s called the cloud.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI really don’t know where the second part of that quote went.\n\nI’ll give you one chance to guess who Waltz was really playing in Spectre. Just one.\n\n4) “Benedict Cumberbatch is NOT Doctor Strange”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe casting process for Marvel’s Sorcerer Supreme was long and arduous—but there was always one front runner: Sherlock star and current “oh god cast him in everything” idol Benedict Cumberbatch. Cumberbatch’s name cropped up time and time again in casting rumors, and then Deadline announced that he was in talks to join the film... and Marvel flatly denied it, essentially going out of their way to be twee and tell fans not to believe everything they hear on the internet.\n\nLittle more than a month later, Benedict Cumberbatch was announced as Doctor Strange. Womp womp.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n3) Pretty much all of The Dark Knight Rises\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs the final entry in Christopher Nolan’s genre-defining Batman trilogy, there was a lot of speculation going in about how the movie would play out, and especially if more familiar faces from the comics and the movies would make an appearance alongside the new additions of Selina Kyle and Bane. The biggest rumors pretty much covered the length and breadth of the film’s cast: Liam Neeson would return as Ra’s Al Ghul, Marion Cotillard’s mysterious new ally was secretly Ra’s daughter Talia, and Robin would appear, with Joseph Gordon-Levitt’s John Blake being the likely candidate.\n\nNolan and the cast frequently dismissed the reports—the director stressed that John Blake and Miranda Tate were wholly new characters, and Liam Neeson frequently said he’d not been asked to return, casting rumors off as just elements from the comic books fans wanted to see on the big screen. Then, Dark Knight Rises came out and Miranda was Talia, Blake revealed his real name to be Robin at the end, and yes, Liam Neeson returned as Ra’s Al Ghul (although his denial was technically correct, as Ra’s appeared as a vision rather than being revived from death). Not really surprising, as Warner Bros. were denying everything about the film going into its release—they even came out and denied that they’d altered Bane’s incomprehensible voice to make him slightly more understandable, for crying out loud.\n\n2) “Benedict Cumberbatch is NOT playing Khan”\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerhaps one of the most infamous casting “twists” ever. Khan had long been rumored as the villain of Star Trek Into Darkness, pretty much since Star Trek hit theaters. But then, Benedict Cumberbatch was cast as the movie’s villain, whom producers described as being a completely new character called John Harrison. They vehemently denied that Khan was in the film, or that Cumberbatch would play him.\n\nSpoilers: Cumberbatch was Khan.\n\nThe reveal fell flat, as fans had guessed Harrison’s real identity even before Cumberbatch was cast—and the overwrought, repeated denial of the obvious helped turn fans against this movie. To the point that, years after the movie came out, Damon Lindelof and JJ Abrams both admitted keeping Khan a “secret” was a bad idea.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1) “Jon Snow is Dead!”\n\nYour browser does not support HTML5 video tag.Click here to view original GIF\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAh, the ongoing saga of Game of Thrones’ Jon Snow, and whether or not his fatal stabbing at the climax of season five was actually fatal. You might think it presumptuous to put Jon on this list, considering we’ve yet to watch the show’s sixth season, but there’s enough information and evidence of Jon Snow not just being alive, but finding himself at the forefront of some major events in Westeros out there, that we’re willing to call it now.\n\nBut man, this last year has been insane. Ever since io9 broke the news in June that actor Kit Harington had been spotted in Belfast preparing to film for Game of Thrones, there has been a swathe of denials, with almost every cast member on the show, including Harington himself, reiterating that Snow was dead and buried, even as the evidence mounted higher and higher against that being true—and dozens of person-hours were spent writing report after report after report about Kit Harington’s unkempt hair.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHell, even HBO aren’t really denying it any more, placing Jon front and centre on teaser posters for the next season. Won’t be long until we can finally put this one behind us.",

It's for this reason that Rooster Teeth is bringing its internet and gaming culture exhibition RTX to Australia this weekend, the first time the event's been held outside of Austin, Texas. \"We've always had a good relationship with people in Australia. It's one of the first places we came to promote Rooster Teeth in 2004\", says Sorola. \"It's one of our stronger countries outside of the US.\" \"Obviously we appeal mostly to English-speaking countries, [but] we probably have more fans in Australia than Canada.\" An annual event comprising panels, live shows, competitions, meet-and-greets and games, RTX began in 2011 as an easy way for the team to keep in touch with its most dedicated fans all at once.\n\nFans line up to get into the store at the RTX exhibition in Austin, Texas. \"We had a lot of fans making meet-ups and events all around the world,\" says Sorola. \"There seemed to be enough demand, and we thought if we made our own they'd all come to us so we wouldn't have to travel any more.\" A handful of Rooster Teeth's series, as seen on its website. RTX 2015 was reportedly attended by 45,000 fans.\n\nWhile Rooster Teeth's most distinguishing feature is its massive fandom, that's built on the back of a long stream of video content that makes up its core business. Rooster Teeth helped popularise the machinima film genre (manipulating video games to create cinematic content) with its first series Red vs. Blue. The series is still running 12 years later, and nearing its 400th episode. It's currently the longest running web series and American sci-fi series of all time. It's not all about video games though. The company produces a large catalogue of shows across a number of genres, including RWBY, the first western anime series to be distributed in Japan. Sorola believes Rooster Teeth has become so popular in part because it combines the strengths of online and traditional productions to build its community. The team is big on direct interaction with its fans — as evidenced by RTX — but it's also big on consistency. Shows are available at the same time and day every week, so fans make it part of their schedule, like a traditional TV show.",
  "latent_22298": "Over the course of 430 pages, the secret report provides provocative glimpses of unmistakably questionable behavior by some of world soccer’s top officials, as well as others eager to meet their every demand. Huge amounts of money ending up in strange places. High-ranking executives behaving shadily, petulantly and, at times, perhaps illegally. Rules broken, slyly circumvented or simply bent beyond their intent.\n\nThe document, known as the Garcia report in tribute to the American who compiled it, but kept secret by FIFA’s ethics committee for more than two years, was surprisingly published on Tuesday by FIFA itself. For the first time, the release confirmed, and in some cases revealed, long-sought details of an investigation into the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. FIFA, the sport’s global governing body, released the report, it said, “for the sake of transparency” — though it notably did so only after a German newspaper revealed on Monday that it had obtained a copy and planned to gradually reveal its unsavory details.\n\nThe report was submitted in 2014 by Michael J. Garcia, a former United States attorney who had served as FIFA’s chief ethics investigator, and contained the findings of a monthslong examination he had conducted into the vote in December 2010 — widely reported to have been tainted by corruption — that awarded the 2018 tournament to Russia and the 2022 event to Qatar.\n\nWhat the Garcia report did not have, in the end, was any hard evidence that the committees for Russia and Qatar had used bribes to secure the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, any smoking gun that might have compelled FIFA to consider moving either of the events, or reopening the bidding for them.",
  "latent_22471": "The Web Design Trends Series is brought to you by the Intel AppUp℠ Developer Program, which provides developers with everything they need to create and then sell their applications to millions of Intel Atom™ processor-based devices. Learn more here.\n\nThe world of web fonts and web typography is exploding. After years of struggle, we're finally at a point where using real fonts on the web is a viable option.\n\nFor web designers, this is huge news because it means a greater degree of control over how content is displayed. For end users, it means a richer web experience.\n\nThanks to web services like Typekit, Fonts.com Web Fonts, Webtype and others, the opportunities to integrate real fonts on the web is getting better all the time.\n\nLet's look at five of the biggest trends taking place with web font and web typography design.\n\n1. WOFF as a Standard\n\nThe Web Open Font Format, or WOFF, is edging ever closer to becoming the de facto standardized format for using fonts on the web.\n\nBacked by Mozilla, Opera and Microsoft, WOFF allows TrueType, OpenType or Open Font Format fonts to be embedded into web pages.\n\nRight now, WOFF support is built into Firefox 3.6 and above, Google Chrome version 5 and above, Internet Explorer 9, and will be supported in upcoming versions of Safari.\n\nJason Santa Maria and his Friends of Mighty built Lost World's Fairs as a way to showcase IE 9 and its support of WOFF. This fantastic piece of typographic web art really shows just how great type can be made to look on the web.\n\n2. Big Foundries Jump on Board\n\nWhen Adobe announced that they were partnering with Typekit back in August, it was a big move. Historically, the biggest font foundries have led the resistance against getting fonts on the web.\n\nAdobe's decision was followed recently by the new company, Webtype, a partnership of Ascender, Roger Black and Font Bureau. Similar to Typekit, Webtype offers a way for designers or end users to get high quality fonts for use in their own designs.\n\nLast week, Monotype Imaging formally launched Fonts.com Web Fonts and brought many of the most famous Monotype, Linotype and ITC font families to the web.\n\nAt this stage, nearly every major foundry is either offering fonts with web usage licenses or is considering making their fonts usable on the web. Eighteen months ago, that wouldn't have been a reality. Today it is.\n\n3. Better Letter Control with Lettering.js\n\nWhen creating the Lost World's Fairs project, Friends of Mighty realized they would need to have a way to better control individual letters and words to offer proper spacing and better kerning.\n\nThus, Lettering.js was born. Lettering.js is a JavaScript plugin that allows developers and designers to better control individual letters without having tons of messy markup.\n\nAs Dan Rubin recently remarked on Twitter, Lettering.js may just end up having a bigger impact on typography on the web than anyone is expecting.\n\n4. Mobile Support\n\nFonts.com Web Fonts service and Typekit both offer support for multiple mobile browsers. This continues to increase as more and more mobile browser makers support various aspects of @font-face and draft specifications like WOFF.\n\nIt's not just enough for fonts to look good on the desktop, as more and more web usage shifts to the smartphone, having readable, legible and properly spaced typography on mobile devices will be a bigger and bigger area of interest.\n\nAlready companies like Monotype and Typekit are working to make sure that fonts look their best on a number of different screen types and sizes.\n\n5. Font Support in Web Apps\n\nOne of the most interesting recent advancements in the web font world has been the ability to choose web fonts when customizing an aspect of a web app. Thanks to Typekit and Google's Web Font Directory, it's easy for developers to build these tools into their product.\n\nAlready many Tumblr themes are coming with Typekit support and new web services like About.me give users the option to customize their typefaces for various aspects of their profile.\n\nThis is a great use of typography on the web because it gives end-users direct interaction with fonts and lets them see directly how different fonts look together and at different sizes.\n\nWeb typography is on a tear and we're at the beginning of a new era of a more beautiful, more legible and more customizable web.\n\nSeries supported by Intel AppUp℠ Developer Program\n\nThe Web Design Trends Series is brought to you by the Intel AppUp℠ Developer Program, which provides developers with everything they need to create and then sell their applications to millions of Intel Atom™ processor-based devices.

  "latent_22541": "Yesterday before the GOP debate, Ralph Reed’s “Faith and Freedom Coalition” (Ralph Reed? wasn’t he totally discredited in the Jack Abramoff scandal?) held an event at which Florida’s Lt. Governor Jennifer Carroll let loose with an openly theocratic speech calling for ‘Christians To Step Up And Lead This Country’, and bashing science, evolution, and the media.\n\nThe freaky fundamentalist wing of the Republican Party has taken over, folks. There’s no longer any doubt.\n\nYou know the Bible says faith is believing in what is not seen, today unfortunately many in the media would like nothing better to ridicule Christians: they promote ‘The Da Vinci Code,’ they place doubt in the public’s mind that Christ was not risen and they condemn the ‘Passion of Christ,’ yet they sensationalize stories that call for the end of prayer in school and removing the name of God from our country’s pledge. Ladies and gentlemen, these are very sad times when we allow the minority to poison the minds of the majority. This is exactly what dictators and socialist rulers did.\n\n…\n\nMan does not have all the answers, some of our political leaders bow down to scientists and let them have the stage to push their evolution, but there’s nothing, nothing a scientist can make, that is exactly like what God creates.\n\n…\n\nTrust Him to give you the strength to fight back against those who want to take God out of our country. Trust Him to give you the wisdom to speak out against injustice and blasphemy of His name. Trust God to guide your path to bring about a righteous government. …\n\nLadies and gentlemen, Christianity is in a fight and it is one of the greatest trials we have seen in modern times. Without a doubt, America and her people are in grave need of prayer, divine guidance, protection, to have good, solid Christians to step up and lead this country on a proper moral path. I firmly believe that if we magnify God, our problems will be minimized.",
  "latent_22654": "Thanks to http://erikjdurwoodii.deviantart.com/\n\nThis is how Google kills your app\n\nJosh Liptzin Blocked Unblock Follow Following Oct 23, 2014\n\nTL;DR The downside of having no app store approval process is that Google will kill your app without warning and you’ll have very little recourse.\n\nIf you’re an app developer, the “Notification from Google Play” email is guaranteed to put a pit in your stomach. If you’ve never gotten one, here’s how it goes:\n\nThis is a notification that your application, XXXXX, with package ID YYYYY, has been removed from the Google Play Store.\n\nIt then proceeds to cite the reason for the removal. In our case, it was due to sexually explicit material uploaded by our users (the app in question is a dating app):\n\nREASON FOR REMOVAL: Violation of the sexually explicit material provision of the Content Policy. Please refer to the Sex and Nudity policy help article for more information.\n\nIt then tells you your options along with some details about the policy:\n\nThis particular app has been disabled as a policy strike. If your developer account is still in good standing, you may revise and upload a policy compliant version of this application as a new package name.\n\nThis notification also serves as notice for remaining, unsuspended violations in your catalog, and you may avoid further app suspensions by immediately unpublishing any apps in violation of (but not limited to) the above policy. Once you have resolved any existing violations, you may republish the app(s) at will. Before publishing applications, please ensure your apps’ compliance with the Developer Distribution Agreement and Content Policy.\n\nAll violations are tracked. Serious or repeated violations of any nature will result in the termination of your developer account, and investigation and possible termination of related Google accounts. If your account is terminated, payments will cease and Google may recover the proceeds of any past sales and/or the cost of any associated fees (such as chargebacks and transaction fees) from you.\n\nIf you feel we have made this determination in error, you can visit the Google Play Help Center article for additional information regarding this removal.\n\nThe Google Play Team\n\nThis is actually the second time we’ve been through this process. Both takedowns occurred without prior warning. Our issue in both cases is that our users sometimes upload nude photos, and nudity is not allowed on applications published to Google Play.\n\nOf course, there’s no algorithm to detect nudity accurately, so we employ a staff of moderators in addition to a third party moderation service in order to quickly remove nudity once it gets uploaded, often within 5 minutes. All that is in addition to standard flagging controls we attach to all content.\n\nBut none of that matters, and Google won’t tell us why. Here’s my response (you only get one, and it must be less than 1,000 characters):\n\nWe are very saddened to have been removed from Google Play.\n\nWe actually went through this process a few months ago. On our last appeal,\n\nwe had an internal Google Director personally review our case and the Play\n\nteam found that we had indeed taken sufficient measures to deal with any\n\ninappropriate user generated content swiftly. To reiterate our process, we\n\nemploy a staff of full time moderators who are constantly reviewing new\n\nphotos that get uploaded to our service around the clock. All inappropriate\n\nimagery is removed within a few hours at most of its initial submission. In\n\nthe rare event that a backlog of new images develops, we automatically fall\n\nback to WebPurify, a third party image moderation service. If you could\n\nplease share with us the specific imagery you found that was in violation,\n\nthen perhaps we can adjust the criteria for our moderation team in order to\n\nbe in full compliance once again. There was no notice at all prior to our\n\nremoval. Thank you!\n\nIn a dream world, we’d get a response like the following:\n\nDear Josh,\n\nWe realize moderating user generated content is a challenging task, especially for a small team like yours. During our review of your app, we found this objectionable material [attached]. These images clearly depict nudity and are in violation of our sexually explicit content provision. Please explain why these have not yet been removed from your application and what steps you will take to fortify your app so that this does not happen again in the future.\n\nRegards,\n\nThe Google Play Team\n\nHowever, we’re not sure what they saw. We’ve built a pretty solid screening process and blatant nudity rarely goes unnoticed. Maybe someone’s pants were too low, or a bathing suit too tight, or maybe someone had a carrot in their mouth. It’s impossible to know. Maybe a response along these lines could help our moderators screen content in a way that is more acceptable to Google?\n\nDear Josh,\n\nIn our recent review of your application, we found the following images [attached] which are sexually suggestive, though do not contain any actual nudity. Please be advised that images depicting [tight bathing suits|pants below the waist|whipped cream] are in violation of our sexually explicit content provision even though they do not technically contain nudity. For this reason we have removed your application from Google Play, however we will allow you to submit an appeal once we have confirmed that the objectionable content has been removed.\n\nRegards,\n\nThe Google Play Team\n\nInstead, we received the friendly boilerplate email below:\n\nHi,\n\nWe have reviewed your appeal and will not be reinstating your app. This decision is final and we will not be responding to any additional emails regarding this removal.\n\nIf your account is still in good standing and the nature of your app allows for republishing you may consider releasing a new, policy compliant version of your app to Google Play under a new package name. We are unable to comment further on the specific policy basis for this removal or provide guidance on bringing future versions of your app into policy compliance. Instead, please reference the REASON FOR REMOVAL in the initial notification email from Google Play.\n\nPlease note that additional violations may result in a suspension of your Google Play Developer account.\n\nRegards,\n\nThe Google Play Team\n\nAstute readers will notice that the app is not actually banned from Google Play. Since our account is still in good standing, we’re allowed to release a new app under a different package name, but that means all reviews will be erased, and the download count will be reset. Existing users can still use the old app, but they won’t receive updates until they download the one with the new package name.\n\nBut this seems like a strange way to approach the issue.\n\nFirst, we have no idea what content caused us to be removed in the first place, and they won’t tell us. Our moderation team has been hard at work, and they’re going to continue doing their job in the same way. So, we’ll just continue to resubmit an exact copy of our current app, since it’s the network, not the app, that’s in violation. What’s the definition of insanity again?\n\nSecond, if the app isn’t permanently banned and can be immediately resubmitted, how does deleting all reviews help anybody? Surely the Google Play users who spent time writing those reviews wouldn’t appreciate them being removed wholesale, not to mention potential new users who might find those reviews helpful.\n\nThird, orphaning all existing users of the application definitely doesn’t help anybody. They’re bound to eventually be confused about why they’re left out of all future app updates, with no advertised features or bug fixes hitting their version.\n\nLike many other developers, we also have an equivalent app on iOS. In the past, I naively sang praise over the lack of a formal app review process on Google Play that iOS employs. After all, it’s so annoying to have to wait a whole week just to add a small feature! It’s so nice to just push out app updates that go live within a few hours.\n\nBut this is the downside. Since all new apps are automatically approved, Google has to be swift about removing apps that turn out to be a violation of their TOS. And when that happens, good luck finding an ear that will listen. I’d much rather have a formal review process, with a human being on the other end I can speak with if an issue comes up, rather than running around like an ant hoping I don’t suddenly get stepped on.\n\nPS Google, your search engine currently indexes a large amount of pornography. You should probably get on that.",
  "latent_22872": "A new study has linked a smartphone app to an increase in the contraceptive use in India.\n\nThe app, containing motivational videos developed to help married rural women in India better understand contraceptive choices, led to a dramatic increase in the number of women using modern family planning methods in just a few months, the Johns Hopkins Center for Communication Programs (CCP) research suggests.\n\nThe researchers say that women who watched videos were 4.5 times more likely to use modern contraceptive methods than those who did not.\n\nThe findings show that mobile technology provides an innovative and dynamic platform for social and behavior change communication, says team lead Sanjanthi Velu, adding that it can encourage conversations between women and frontline health workers that are interactive, culturally relevant, and personalized - and that lead to increased, sustained use of modern contraceptive methods.\n\nAs part of a larger communications initiative, CCP developed the app, called Gyan Jyoti, or \"light of knowledge,\" for use in the state of Bihar in India under Project Ujjwal, a UK aid-funded family planning project led by Palladium. The app is designed for use by ASHAs, community health workers in India, who visit the homes of rural women to promote family planning and other healthy behaviors.\n\nThe app incorporates a variety of videos about family planning and modern contraceptive methods, including entertaining and educational films, testimonials from happy couples who are using contraception, Q & A videos with physicians and other information that aims to dispel myths and misconceptions.\n\nThe study is presented at the International Family Planning Conference in Nusa Dua, Indonesia.

  "latent_22915": "A man says to me, “How do you like that car?” I’m standing by a little green Kia. “It’s not mine, it’s a rental,” I say. I’m in the town of Okeechobee, Florida, parked on the main drag in front of Nutmeg’s Cafe. “Where you from?” he says.\n\n“Minnesota.”\n\n“I hear they just got more snow up there.”\n\n“How do you like that car?” is a classic opening of a casual conversation between two men who don’t know each other and it can lead in various directions, if the two have the urge to talk.\n\nHe’s from Connecticut, I find out, and has lived in nearby Fort Pierce for several years. He thought when he moved to Florida that he’d be spending a lot of time on beaches but he hasn’t been on a beach much at all. He drives a 1947 Packard convertible that he fixed up himself. He moved here because Florida is better for the Packard and also to see to his father who is 87 and also to get away from a broken romance. He and his dad have breakfast together every Thursday morning. He misses the North, the big winter storms, the bracing chill in the air, but Florida is OK. He is thinking of buying property in Okeechobee. He likes small towns. He recommends I see Fort Pierce and drive the Indian River highway down the coast.\n\nHe offers all of this in one brief encounter standing on the sidewalk and when we say so long, I have no idea what his politics are, if he attends church, what he does for a living, how he feels about climate change, but I do feel warmly about Okeechobee.\n\nThese common social moments aren’t as common as they used to be. For one thing, so many people wear headphones and you’d have to tap them on the shoulder and have something serious to say, like “Your pants are on fire.” An older man avoids striking up a conversation with a younger woman, for fear it will be misconstrued, or with younger men because their default response is “Hnnph.” You stand in line at a store counter, people are busy texting, Googling on their phones, checking their inboxes, you hesitate to say, “Beautiful weather we’re having.” Or “Those are good-looking boots you’re wearing.” Or “How do you like that car”?\n\nI hitchhiked a lot back in my teens and remember the men who gave me a lift and how talkative they were. I was a shy kid and so older people opened up to me. It was a hitchhiker’s job to shut up and listen: That was how you paid for the ride. They complained about their jobs, talked about the war, gave you advice about women and life. But nobody hitchhikes anymore, and thanks to the universality of gizmos, small talk has become rare, and a person comes to feel he’s living in a hostile world, which is not true at all.\n\nWhen I lived in Denmark, small talk with a stranger was the hardest language to get a handle on — the big declarative textbook sentences don’t work in that context — so much is conveyed by tone, by harrumph and sigh and nonsense sounds, the Danish equivalents of “Oy” and “Uff da” and “Yikes.” Flying back to New York and walking through JFK, I felt immersed in small talk, like a sea lion returning to the herd.\n\nMy dad loved Florida. His Minnesota life was constrained by family and church and job, and in Florida he went into business as an itinerant knife-sharpener, working a long route of restaurants, meeting strangers, making small talk, which he dearly loved. He was a Christian fundamentalist, bound by strict doctrine, but on the knife route, he could talk about weather, children, sports, cars, without reference to the Rapture and the Millennium. It was the freedom to be ordinary.\n\nThe Indian River highway was a disappointment: a two-lane road along a solid phalanx of mansions behind gates and no place to stop and admire the Atlantic. But the conversation with the guy curious about the green Kia was memorable. Two weeks have passed since and I haven’t had another encounter like it. They say the country is bitterly divided.

  "latent_23012": "In another life, North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un’s propaganda chief could have had a heck of a career as an insult comic.\n\nThe latest screed from Pyongyang’s unnamed prince of prose (or princes -- it's unclear how many write these gems) was delivered Monday in response to Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., asserting Kim Jong Un was a “whack job.”\n\nLike previous statements, it bucked all norms for engaging in international repartee:\n\n“It is a serious provocation that Gardner, like a psychopath, dare to bear the evil that dares our highest dignity,” the statement said, according to a translation. “It is America’s misfortune that a man mixed in with human dirt like Gardner, who has lost basic judgment and body hair, could only spell misfortune for the United States.”\n\nThe real-world reference point behind some of the putdowns, most of which are disseminated by the state-run Korean Central News Agency, is unclear. Gardner, for instance, has a full head of hair.\n\nBut KCNA has been dealing out hits against U.S. and international politicians for years, perfecting a style that’s veered from jaw-dropping to shockingly racist.\n\nAmong the worst insults directed at former President Barack Obama, North Korea in 2014 branded him a “juvenile delinquent,” “clown” and a “dirty fellow.” Obama, the KCNA statement said, was somebody who “does not even have the basic appearances of a human being.”\n\nEarlier that year, an unidentified North Korean spokesperson called ex-Secretary of State John Kerry a “wolf donning the mask of sheep” who had a “hideous lantern jaw.”\n\nKerry’s predecessor, Hillary Clinton, was described in 2009 as “by no means intelligent” and a “funny lady.”\n\n“Sometimes she looks like a primary schoolgirl and sometimes a pensioner going shopping,” an unnamed North Korean source said.\n\nThe reclusive regime has also made former South Korean President Park Geun-hye a popular target, alternately naming her as a “senile granny,” a “tailless, old, insane b----,” and “a traitor for all times.”\n\nOn the last description, North Korea may have scored a late victory. Geun-hye was forced out of office amid an influence-peddling scandal.\n\nKim Jong Un’s staff was no easier on former President George W. Bush’s administration: Bush was called a “hooligan” who looked like “a chicken soaked in the rain,” Vice President Dick Cheney was “mentally deranged” and a “most cruel monster and bloody-thirsty beast” and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld was termed a “political dwarf, human scum or hysteric.”",
  "latent_23178": "Penn State's Model Railroad Club has been in the basement of Pinchot Hall for the past 15 years but is now looking for a new home. Photo: Joe Whitman\n\nPenn State’s Model Railroad Club needs to find a new home on campus, even though members have spent the past 15 years designing and building its railroad layout tucked in a deep corner of campus — the basement of Pinchot Hall. Because of the ongoing renovations in East Halls, the university has given the club until April 2018 to move out of its current space.\n\n“All the members who have come through here have kind of put their mark on this layout,” Club President Michael Dempsey said.\n\nMost members have worked on their own projects during their time in the club, transforming the railroad layout along the way. Some students focus on the electronics and command system side of the layout, but projects can be anything from painting the actual train engines and cars to designing and creating new buildings and aspects of the landscape. Many of the train cars and the towns around the layout are named after former members and advisors.\n\nPhoto: Joe Whitman\n\nPhoto: Joe Whitman\n\nUnfortunately, many of these projects can’t be moved to a new location. The dozen-member club will instead have a sort of clean slate for designing a new layout.\n\n“This organization is about a third as old as the university,” Dempsey said. “It’s kind of significant. You don’t want to see it go away.”\n\nThe Model Railroad Club was founded in the mid-1950s and is one of the oldest student organizations at Penn State; current advisor John Spychalski, now an emeritus faculty member in the Smeal College of Business, took over in 1969 after the original advisor retired. The railroad layout was housed in the HUB for a number of years until the club moved to Pinchot Hall 15 years ago.\n\nThe layout isn’t modeled after any specific location but is mostly set in the 1950s and 1960s. It also features some Penn State details like the Nittany Lion Shrine and a “Penn State Lives Here” sign.\n\nDempsey said the club maintains a number of drop-off and pick-up locations to use when members hold “operating sessions” to run trains on the layout as if it was a real railroad. Using a predetermined plan, each member will run a train around a layout to specific locations as if they were actually transporting products via railway.\n\nThe locomotives are ordered around the track using DCC, or digital command control. Basically, each engine has a number corresponding to commands on the master control panel. Members can use the panel to control what direction the trains run and how fast they move.\n\nPhoto: Joe Whitman\n\nPhoto: Joe Whitman\n\nPerhaps the most impressive part of the layout is the landscaping. The rock walls and mountains you see were all hand-carved from plaster and hand-painted by members of the club. For the smaller foliage like grass and bushes, the club uses colored foam to create the right texture. The water, which looks incredibly realistic, is made of melted plastic beads and poured into place to harden.\n\n“The layout itself can’t really be moved,” Dempsey said. “It just wasn’t designed to be.”\n\nClub leaders are trying to work with student affairs and other administrators to find a new home for the University Park & East Line, although space is at a premium on campus. Until then, it’s business as usual in the basement of Pinchot Hall.\n\nThe club opens the layout to the community during open houses, when families will come see the trains. While learning how the layout works, many returning visitors look forward to a game of Where’s Waldo, which allows them to discover new details of the layout they may not have otherwise noticed while looking for Waldo.\n\nThe club’s next open houses will be held during THON weekend and Blue-White Weekend.\n\nPhoto: Joe Whitman",

  "latent_23449": "A poll on the front page of last Tuesday’s Le Monde , that bible of the French Left-leaning Establishment (think a simultaneously boring and hectoring Guardian ), translated into stark figures the winter of François Hollande’s discontent.\n\nMore than 70 per cent of the French feel taxes are “excessive”, and 80 per cent believe the president’s economic policy is “misguided” and “inefficient”. This goes far beyond the tax exiles such as Gérard Depardieu, members of the Peugeot family or Chanel’s owners. Worse, after decades of living in one of the most redistributive systems in western Europe, 54 per cent of the French believe that taxes – of which there have been 84 new ones in the past two years, rising from 42 per cent of GDP in 2009 to 46.3 per cent this year – now widen social inequalities instead of reducing them.\n\nThis is a noteworthy departure, in a country where the much-vaunted value of “equality” has historically been tinged with envy and resentment of the more fortunate. Less than two years ago, the most toxic accusation levied at Nicolas Sarkozy was of being “le président des riches”, favouring his yacht-sailing CEO buddies with tax breaks and sweet deals. By contrast, Hollande, the bling-free candidate, was elected on a platform of increasing state spending by promising to create 60,000 teachers’ jobs, as well as 150,000 subsidised entry-level public-service jobs for the long-time unemployed and the young – without providing for significant savings elsewhere.\n\nBy 2014, France’s public expenditure will overtake Denmark’s to become the world’s highest: 57 per cent of GDP. In effect, just to keep in the same place, like a hamster on a wheel, and ensure that the European Central Bank in Frankfurt isn’t too unhappy with us, Hollande now needs cash. Technocrats, MPs and ministers have been instructed to find every euro they can rake in – in deferred benefits, cancelled tax credits, extra levies. As they ignore the notion of making some serious cuts (mooted at regular intervals by the IMF, the OECD and even France’s own Cour des Comptes), the result can be messy.\n\nOn the one hand, the lacklustre economy and finance minister Pierre Moscovici recently admitted that he “understood” the French’s “exasperation” with their heavy tax burden. This earned him a sharp rap on the fingers from the president and his beleaguered PM, Jean-Marc Ayrault. On the other, new taxes keep being announced, in chaotic fashion, nearly every week. “Announced” doesn’t mean “implemented”: the Hollande crowd have developed a unique Wile E Coyote-style of leaks, technical glitches, last-minute tweaks and horse-market bargaining whereby almost nobody knows, at any given time, who will be targeted by the taxman, and how. Unsurprisingly, this is liked by no one except us reptiles of the press, eager to report on the longest series of own goals in the history of government communications.\n\nTake last year’s famous 75 per cent supertax, on individuals earning over one million euros a month. This has still not been implemented. First, it got struck down by France’s Constitutional Council on a technicality. Leaks suggested the rate would fall to 66 per cent. They were confirmed, then denied. Hollande eventually vowed that the tax would be paid by the targeted individuals’ employers, for daring to offer such “obscenely” high salaries. This has just been approved by the National Assembly, and must still pass the Senate. So far, it is only supposed to apply to 2013 and 2014 income, but no one knows if the bill will be prolonged, killed or transformed.\n\nWhat we do know is that this non-existent (so far) tax has been the clincher that sent hundreds, possibly thousands of French citizens abroad: not just “the rich”, whom Hollande, during his victorious campaign, said he personally “disliked”, and who now are pushing up house prices in South Kensington and fighting bitterly over the Lycée Charles de Gaulle’s 1,200 new places; but also the ambitious young, who feel that their own country will turn on them the minute they achieve any measure of personal success.\n\nIn the heart of Paris’s Right Bank, where I live, only foreigners seem to buy flats, at prices entirely disconnected from reality. In my street, I have spotted three new Maseratis. Even before seeing their Qatari plates, I knew they couldn’t belong to local owners: they’re an ostentatious admission of wealth no one wants to make in Hollande’s France. (A luxury car is one of the “outward signs of wealth” your tax inspector has been specifically trained to query. The lesson has been learnt: last year, Rolls-Royce sold no cars in France.) On the Left Bank, elegant Americans buy bijoux apartments on place de Furstenberg, at 30,000 euros per square metre, and venture into the fine Café de Flore for elevenses.\n\n“It’s not only that people don’t like to be treated like criminals just because they’re successful,” says a French banker friend who has recently moved to London. “But this uncertainty in every aspect of the tax system means it is impossible to do business: you don’t know what your future costs are, or your customer’s. You can’t buy, you can’t sell, you can’t hire, you can’t fire.”\n\nWhile I’m still happy in Paris, I envy him his surroundings, the vibrancy of London, the feeling that anything is possible, the sense of fun I remember from the years I lived there in the Eighties and Nineties, and that I gladly find again every time I zoom in on the Eurostar. Paris, my city of birth, is an elegant museum – where any new idea, in any context, seems to be fated to be shot down by a combination of old, structural conformism and blasé disenchantment.\n\nToday, one out of four French university graduates wants to emigrate, “and this rises to 80 per cent or 90 per cent in the case of marketable degrees”, says economics professor Jacques Régniez, who teaches at both the Sorbonne and the University of New York in Prague. “In one of my finance seminars, every single French student intends to go abroad.”\n\n“The French workforce is now two-speed,” explains a headhunter who shuttles between Paris and London. “Among the young, perhaps a third speak English, are willing to relocate, and want to work. For one thing, their dream employers are the more prosperous of the large French multinationals, almost all those in the CAC40 index, who make over half of their profits abroad, sometimes over 90 per cent – companies like, say, L’Oréal, Schneider or Danone. This is why French universities have shocked the Académie française and now teach many courses in English.\n\n“But I’ve also seen determined young people take jobs in places like Vietnam, with local contracts and nothing like the level of protection afforded by French labour law, in order to gain a proper first experience of business in a competitive environment. And then you have a large group whose ambition is simply to stay outside the economy.”\n\nThis means a trade-off with which anyone in France is familiar: young people, and many of their parents, dream of getting any kind of state or local administration post, usually badly paid, very often frustrating, but which ensures complete job security, unrelated to the economic situation, the market, or their own performance.\n\nMore than a quarter of the French workforce is employed by some public body or other: schools, hospitals, local and regional councils, the police, the civil service proper – or those new subsidised public-service jobs the Hollande government is so keen on.\n\nWhile the young French generations were aspiring to cocoon themselves away from the realities of the world, our nearest neighbours were following the opposite trend. In 2000, under a socialist chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, German businesses paid an astonishing 51.6 per cent company tax – largely to pay for the previous decade’s reunification. Today, this is down to 29.8 per cent, when the French equivalent, the highest in Europe, is 38 per cent. By 2003, Schroeder had embarked on a widespread reform programme, lowering taxes and drastically slashing benefits, curtailing the influence of the unions, and eventually reducing German unemployment from 10 per cent to 7 per cent (it’s 11 per cent in France).\n\nThere are many reasons why this wouldn’t work in France, not least because the French Socialists happen to have noticed that Schroeder and his party reformed themselves out of a job. Another is that French unions represent very little: less than 8 per cent of the French workforce overall is unionised, a figure that falls to between 3 per cent and 5 per cent in the private sector. Unions do, however, play a mandated part in a number of negotiation and welfare net structures, the unemployment benefits system, retraining schemes and the national health and pensions co-administration. This, not members’ contributions, keeps them afloat. The law also provides for legal labour dispute fines to be paid to the unions.\n\nFrench unions see as their main goal the preservation of the status quo: from overprotective labour laws that make it so hard to fire employees that French bosses will do almost anything to avoid hiring new staff (who cost them a whopping 70 per cent in payroll taxes), to perpetuating antiquated regulations dating back to Vichy France, banning Sunday trading and evening shifts.\n\nRecent union legal actions have forced businesses to close on evenings and Sundays, from the cosmetics chain Sephora – where employees protested that they wanted to keep working their late hours – to the British-owned DIY chain Castorama, which belongs to Kingfisher: no wonder Ian Cheshire, Kingfisher’s chief executive, complained last Friday that this harmed the French economy as well as his stores. “The president has said that recovery is in sight: I’m not sure where he’s looking at the moment. The mood is improving in the UK, not in France.”\n\nIt wasn’t fated to happen. “By 2000,” says Jacques Régniez, “French multinationals had achieved a very high level of competitiveness. Having committed to the strong franc, in the run-up to the euro they were forced to become lean and efficient. They rationalised production, and French workers became some of the most productive in the world.” French utilities, insurers, aerospace makers and luxury-goods conglomerates were up there with the best. If you wanted the best nuclear plant, crocodile handbag, commercial aircraft, high-speed train, you bought French.\n\nWhat went wrong, says Régniez, was a bill passed by the then socialist Lionel Jospin government reducing the working week to 35 hours. “Where our competitors, especially the Germans, saw the need to keep prices and costs down, France spent money she couldn’t afford.” The entire system, he explains, tilted fatally to the side of salary hikes, perks and a lowering of retirement age, in the face of every observable demographic trend. Investment slowed down in the private sector, and almost stopped in the public one. “Each year, France has missed out on four GDP points of capital investment. By now, after a decade-and-a-half, we are not only lagging behind, it’s not certain we can make up for it. It would cost a 4.5 per cent hike in VAT, and other significant hikes in payroll taxes. That, quite simply, is not realistic.”\n\nEven France’s vaunted infrastructures – those trains, roads, telecoms cables, the once ultra-performing electrical grid, the nuclear plants, the delayed 4G network – have taken a severe hit.\n\nA French businessman who moved to London last year and asked not to be quoted by name, “because my tax audit would be even more retaliatory than what I’m currently being subjected to”, compares July’s Brétigny train crash, France’s worst rail disaster in a quarter of a century that killed six and injured 100, to the Paddington and Potters Bar derailments. “The rolling stock is ageing, the tracks are in a constant state of disrepair, even the TGVs now have regular delays because of catenary failure.”\n\nDespite disputing allegations of negligence, SNCF have said they will reinforce maintenance “without waiting for the conclusions of the inquiry”. Criticisms have also been made that vast sums went on salaries, benefits and pensions.\n\nBut most analysts share the blame between Left- and Right-wing French governments in the past two decades. An investment banker, who has also moved to London recently, dates the wrong choices from the first Jacques Chirac presidency, in 1995. Chirac and his PM Alain Juppé, both Gaullists, decided to reform the huge French public sector’s pension system, to align civil servants’ pay-as-you-go pensions, which were (and still are) much more favourable, with those of the private sector.\n\nThere followed three weeks of hard strikes, shutting down the entire country, from schools to public transport to utilities and the post office. Juppé was ready to stick it out, but Chirac blinked. The reform was shelved, and for the next 12 years he stayed in office, Chirac never, ever tried to clash with vested interests again.\n\nSarkozy had great plans after his 2007 election. He believed in business, and good pay for hard work, and was devastatingly frank about it. It might – perhaps – have passed in prosperous times: one year on, the financial crisis hit, and his brusque style and love of bling clashed with both the times and age-old French preferences. (France is an old Catholic country that, for over a century, was influenced by unapologetic Marxism. It is atavistically hostile to money.) The reforms Sarko managed to pass, much milder than necessary, still ensured his unpopularity. He bet on French realism, and lost.\n\nRealism – actual, real-life realism – is not an accusation you can levy at Hollande. Like Chirac – who supported him both because of a deep personal dislike for Sarkozy, and because they are in many ways very similar – France’s unlikely seventh president of the Fifth Republic is a professional politician, a graduate of the top government school ENA, and has never held a job in the private sector. Both Chirac and Hollande come from Corrèze, in central France, a region that has regularly provided French politics with a certain type of wily opportunist. Both appear easy-going and friendly, and both are complete cynics, with very little in the way of ideals, and an infinite capacity to scheme in order to stay in power.\n\nChirac, like Hollande, knew how to cultivate an array of political allies: in the case of Hollande, this means keeping the Left of his party as well as his Green allies happy with a number of symbolic measures, from the supertax to the recent anti-fracking bill.\n\nUninterested in the impact of morale and image on politics and the economy, Hollande believes that the economic cycle is bound to turn (he has said several times already that the recession is behind us), and that all he’s got to do is stay in power until things get better – thanks to the Chinese, the Americans, it hardly matters which. He doesn’t even worry about Marine Le Pen’s inroads in local elections: a junior aide in the Mitterrand Élysée 25 years ago, he believes the National Front, conjured up by his old boss, is a convenient accessory designed to split the Right and help him win a second term in 2017.\n\nProfessor Régniez believes this is very dangerous. “Sarkozy narrowly lost in 2012 for personal reasons – his style annoyed voters who could have agreed on his policies, but who wanted to punish him: 18 per cent of them voted for Marine Le Pen, against only 5 per cent for her father in 2007.\n\n“This should be a warning to other countries, like Britain – it’s all very well punishing a conservative politician you’re dissatisfied with by voting for a maverick, Le Pen here, Farage there. But it gets the likes of Hollande elected. Think well: is ours the kind of future you want for your country?”",
  "latent_23526": "Editor’s note: Tadhg Kelly is a veteran game designer, creator of leading game design blog What Games Are and creative director of Jawfish Games. You can follow him on Twitter here.\n\nGame developers, publishers and platform holders regularly argue the toss on the appropriate pricing of games. They struggle with questions of whether being too expensive cuts off oxygen to new players, or whether being too cheap means they become devalued. In a free-to-play era especially, this question grows even more complicated. Those kinds of games require certain compromises in game design, and those compromises do not work for all kinds of game.\n\nThe results of that argument play out differently over various platforms. Facebook games, for example, are almost entirely free-to-play, while console games are retailed at comparatively high prices. Steam makes most of its bones in holiday sales when games are often 75 percent off, while iOS advocates endlessly debate the virtue of $0.99 or $1.99, or the occasional outlier like Minecraft at $6.99. Each breeds its own tensions, but – for me at least – it seems that the optimum price for non-free-to-play digital games is around $5.\n\nI base this from a study that development studio 2DBoy ran a few years ago. The studio sold copies of its hit game World of Goo using a flexible pricing model. You could buy the game at whatever price you liked. The developers then compiled and released all of the sales data. The results were interesting, showing that of all the price points that users chose, $5 seemed to work best in terms of numbers of downloads versus pay-off.\n\nInformally, I’ve seen the same magic number seem to work wonders across the board. Steam sales often encourage mass purchases from users of games in or around the $5 mark (ask any PC gamer just how many impulse purchases they have made at this level that they have not yet played). Similarly, second-hand retailing of games often serves as a kind of library for gamers, where they essentially maintain a deposit with a store by buying a game, and then trade-in-and-top-up with a few dollars each time to get the next game, and the next one.\n\nThe reason is that $5 is cheap enough to consider a punt on a game without going through the rigmarole of trying a demo, or pirating the game, and it especially makes sense for kids. Kids operate on a pocket-money budget most of the time, which means that they swap, loan, copy and otherwise get access to many more games than they can reasonably afford. This kind of activity is how they play a lot, form their tastes and go on to become valuable adult customers down the road.\n\nThat’s why the recent news broken by Edge (Disclosure: I write a column for Edge magazine) about the next Xbox being always-online and locking games to accounts is so significant. The notion that a game that you buy soul-binds itself to your account is not new. Your iPad already does exactly this, for example, as does your Steam account. Once you buy a copy of XCOM Enemy Unknown or Temple Run 2, you can’t pass it on.\n\nThis, largely, is the thinking behind locking games on console for disk- and digital-sold games. If you buy your Halo 5 in Gamestop and insert it into your next Xbox, the thinking goes, it will only ever work for you. So, no second sales or borrows or swaps.\n\nIn principle this makes publishers very happy because they resent the grey markets of piracy and second-hand retail with a passion. Likewise, everyone assumes that the entire console business is going digital anyway, and with the death of media retailers like HMV it’s only a matter of time. The combination of the two seems to promise a future where all console games will be sold at high prices, all the time, and everybody will make money.\n\nMicrosoft’s $5 Problem\n\nMaybe, but at the expense of younger players. During my formative years I was an inveterate pirate. I got my start with a Sinclair Spectrum and games recorded on cassette tape. In the schoolyard I would swap, copy and even compile mix-tape compilations of games on larger cassettes, writing start numbers on the inlays. I would also buy games by the truckload. As a result, I played a lot of games.\n\nWhether you came up in the console era and swapped cartridges like a maniac at lunchtime, or copied floppy disks at home and prayed they would work, try lots of free-to-play games on Facebook, or buy lots of cheap apps, chances are that you’ve played many cheap or free games. It’s a part of growing up that you have way more time than money. You bore easily, but also become highly passionate toward the things that do not bore you, and you learn like crazy. You become invested, perhaps in a few games or in the whole culture of being a gamer, and this turns you into a lifelong fan of that platform.\n\nUnless, of course, you can’t afford to. Then you just go elsewhere.\n\nThe problem as I see it for the next Xbox, or PS4, and this wish to lock games in, is that I just don’t see Microsoft lowering itself enough to charge $5 for Halo 5. Rather, I think they’re thinking to turn every previously-a-borrower potential customer into a $50 actual customer, and so is every other publisher that wants to see this kind of locking happen. And that’s simply ludicrous. A locked-in strategy only works in a $5-or-less world.\n\nMicrosoft should have owned the digital gaming space years ago, not Apple. It had the solution in place, millions of customers, and the hardware to play really great games. But the problem was that Microsoft could not really allow itself to enable those games to find their natural price point. Even today if you browse through the Xbox 360 back catalogue there are many 2- and 3-year old games that are being offered at twice or three times what you would pay for them new at retail, never mind second-hand prices.\n\nEven while iOS races ahead as a gaming platform, console makers like Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo have not meaningfully responded. Part of the psychosis of these companies is that they still believe that they are a premium offering, and so they act like a fancy Nordstrom store selling perfume, luggage and handbags for vastly inflated prices. They get tied up in arguments over whether they should allow their product to be devalued (as though the rest of the world does not exist), and whether that is good for games in the long term.\n\nLong story short: They are not in the position where they can make $5 work, and their publishers are not willing to sell Call of Duty for such small amounts. And that opens the door to OUYA, Gamestick, Steamboxes and the oncoming storm of microconsoles.\n\nWhereas Xbox and such are all bound up in these massive and complicated tangles, microconsoles like the OUYA are perfectly happy to work with smaller developers and publishers. They are keen to deliver that App-Store-like relationship to the TV space, and they are increasingly well-placed to make the price argument. If it comes down to Microsoft demanding premium money for a console and games with no comeback or resale, versus an OUYA for $99 that sells games for $5, that becomes an easy decision for any parent. So the OUYA becomes the platform that onboards young players.\n\nPerhaps there is a growing market for a console that is just for adults, for so-called “graymers” who are happy to pay for premium experiences.

In addition, criminal litigation will continue uninterrupted. But the department will be forced to stop or curtail activities including most civil litigation, community outreach to victims of crime and the processing of grants.\n\nHolder told employees Wednesday that \"as soon as funding lapses federal departments and agencies will not be permitted to incur further financial obligations performing activities funded by annual appropriations except those related to the orderly suspension of operations or performance of excepted activities.\"\n\nAs various federal agencies scramble to nail down funds with the shutdown looming, FBI Director Robert Mueller told Congress Wednesday the proposed short-term funding measure for the balance of this year would leave the FBI behind other agencies in dealing with vital intelligence.\n\nMueller testified the FBI needs the same assurance of full funding Congress is prepared to give the Defense Department.\n\n\"I can only say that under the proposed CR (continuing resolution) the FBI would be the only major partner in the intelligence community that is NOT fully funded. And while our intelligence community partners would be able to proceed with planned initiatives and programs, the Bureau (FBI) could not,\" Mueller said.\n\nFBI and Justice officials declined to elaborate on Mueller's statements.\n\nMueller also insisted, \"We simply cannot afford to return to the pre-9/11 days where hiring and staffing at the FBI was a roller-coaster that left most field offices understaffed.\" Mueller blamed pre-9/11 funding uncertainties for \"degradation of the FBI's physical and information technology infrastructure that contributed to shortcomings in our capabilities.\"\n\nSome FBI employees, like those in other law enforcement agencies, are nervously awaiting word on whether they will be declared \"nonessential\" and be subject to furlough.\n\nViews on the matter varied. Unlike in 1995, this time few expect they will be paid for time they are furloughed, but as one employee told CNN, \"I could use a little time off, paid or not.\" Another, however, complained, \"Doesn't Congress understand we have bills to pay?\"",

Even the best creams can take years to work, so she said you don’t necessarily have to spend the big bucks.\n\n“They can go into their drug store, into their mass market stores and they get excellent products for a lot less and get great results,” Dr. Graf said.\n\nShe said the number one anti-aging trick is using good old-fashioned vitamin A in the form of retinol.\n\nCBS 2 reached out to Estee Lauder but the company would not comment because of pending litigation.\n\nThe lawsuit will not move forward until a judge decides who is eligible to join the class of litigants.\n\nNo specific amount of money has been requested yet.\n\nYou May Also Be Interested In These Stories",
  "latent_23788": "WASHINGTON -- The Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) is increasingly using human shields -- particularly children -- to prevent the U.S.-led coalition from carrying out airstrikes in key areas such as Ramadi, according to a senior Obama administration official who briefed reporters at the White House.\n\nFighters are even using children as escorts while maneuvering in the street in order to exploit U.S. rules of engagement, which are intended to avoid collateral damage.\n\nDespite that the U.S. is able to kill a mid-to-high level ISIS leader \"every two days or so,\" but the ISIS shield tactic complicates a U.S. military operation that the Pentagon likes to call \"the most precise air campaign in the history of war.\"\n\nCBS News senior national security correspondent David Martin has reported that while there is no hard and fast rule governing permissible civilian casualties in U.S. airstrikes and each strike is evaluated individually, he is not aware of any case when a bombing was authorized with knowledge that more than five innocent people were present.\n\nBy barricading themselves with civilians the terror group has inhibited U.S. airpower in the key Iraqi city of Ramadi, tilting the fight more toward being a \"street by street\" battle.\n\nThat's an advantage because the coalition is reliant on the relatively weak national military in Iraq, and a patchwork of local groups to act as ground forces in Syria.\n\nObama on decision to send ground troops to fight ISIS\n\nThe official said U.S. Special Forces have not yet been ordered to conduct any so-called \"accompanied missions\" alongside friendly forces on the ground in Syria.\n\nThe Obama Administration argues that so-called \"core ISIS\" in Iraq and Syria has become a \"dramatically degraded\" network within the past six months due to improved U.S. intelligence and targeting. That means U.S. warplanes have been able to drop more bombs and limit the growth of ISIS-held territory.\n\n\"It is not expanding anymore,\" the official told reporters during a Thursday briefing. He then went on to acknowledge that it would be \"extremely difficult\" to expel ISIS from the group's two strongholds in Mosul, Iraq and Raqaa, Syria. That is why the coalition is focusing on cutting supply lines between the two cities.\n\nThe White House is eager to point to any success during its year-long air campaign given recent criticism that it has failed to stop ISIS from being able to launch terror attacks, including the recent ones in Turkey, Lebanon and Paris.\n\nIt has also spawned ISIS-affiliates in countries like Egypt and Libya, which are far afield of the U.S. bombing campaign.\n\n\"You never completely eliminate an organization like this,\" the official said, comparing it to the more than decade-long fight against al Qaeda.",
  "latent_23869": "SOON after it attacked America on September 11th 2001, al-Qaeda issued a book by its co-founder, Ayman al-Zawahiri, setting out a grand strategy. “Knights under the Prophet’s Banner” explained that striking America, not local regimes, would galvanise Muslims everywhere; jihadists had to cleave “to the masses” and needed a “base in the heart of the Muslim world” to achieve eventual success.\n\nIn the event, al-Qaeda was chased from Afghanistan and dispersed by American forces, which eventually killed its leader, Osama bin Laden. In Iraq, the jihadists were nearly wiped out as the masses turned against them, for a time. And with the subsequent collapse of Syria and Iraq, al-Qaeda was eclipsed by its rebellious progeny, Islamic State (IS), which declared a caliphate in 2014 and has inspired jihadists—and earned the enmity of everyone else—ever since.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\nYet the threat from al-Qaeda never disappeared. Its central leadership remains committed to attacking the West; its regional branches are active; and Mr Zawahiri remains at large. The IS caliphate looks likely to be dismantled as American-backed forces close on its strongholds of Raqqa and Mosul. By contrast, Mr Zawahiri’s dream of a secure base for al-Qaeda in the Arab world may be turning into reality. So, at least, fear Western governments.\n\nAl-Qaeda’s Syrian branch, Jabhat al-Nusra (“The Support Front”), has taken a central role in the fight against Bashar al-Assad’s regime. Mr Zawahiri’s deputy, Abu Khayr al-Masri, released by Iran in a prisoner swap last year, has moved to Syria with several other senior al-Qaeda figures, Western officials say. There is talk that al-Qaeda may soon declare an Islamic “emirate” (one notch down from a caliphate).\n\nSuch worries go some way to explaining the terms of the latest ceasefire in Syria negotiated by America and Russia. Its central bargain is this: if the Russians restrain Mr Assad and allow humanitarian supplies into besieged areas held by rebels, America will join Russia in targeting Jabhat al-Nusra (as well as IS). The first such joint operations since the end of the cold war will start if the ceasefire holds for a week after coming into force on September 12th.\n\nJohn Kerry, the American secretary of state, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, did not agree on a future government for Syria, let alone a timetable for Mr Assad to step down. But Mr Kerry rejects the notion that America has, in effect, bowed to Russia and its intervention to prop up Mr Assad: “Going after Nusra is not a concession to anybody,” he says. “It is profoundly in the interests of the United States to target al-Qaeda.”\n\nBut America risks being seen as doing Mr Assad’s bidding. “This is a conspiracy against the Syrian people to bring their revolution to an end,” says Mostafa Mahamed, the Nusra front’s English-language spokesman. “We are one of the strongest forces fighting the regime, and the world knows it.”\n\nOn the eve of the Kerry-Lavrov deal, someone appears to have made a down-payment: an unknown aircraft struck a meeting of rebel commanders, killing Abu Omar Saraqib, a prominent Nusra figure. Whoever carried it out, rebels of all persuasions mourned his death. “Saraqib was the engineer of the military operations of one of the strongest rebel alliances in Syria. His death will weaken the revolution,” says Zakaria Malahfeji of Fastaqim Kama Umirt, a rebel faction in Aleppo that receives military support from America. Such sentiments say much about the failures of American policy in Syria, and the success of al-Qaeda’s belated pragmatism.\n\nThink global, act local\n\nJabhat al-Nusra has played a long game. Like IS, its roots lie in al-Qaeda’s jihad against American troops (and increasingly against Shias) in Iraq; both later grew in Syria’s blood-soaked soil. But whereas IS doubled down on its anti-Shia sectarianism and the “management of savagery”, Jabhat al-Nusra sought to learn from the excesses of Iraq. IS favours ostentatious brutality, the extermination of rivals and the imposition of strict sharia rules. It took the fast lane to the caliphate, and calls on supporters worldwide to attack the West by whatever means. Jabhat al-Nusra, by contrast, seeks to win the respect of brutalised Sunnis by fighting Mr Assad; sharia strictures have, for the most part, been light; the caliphate is a long-term objective, to be established when conditions are ripe. Jabhat al-Nusra has formed alliances with more moderate groups; and it has focused on the fight in Syria rather than global jihad.\n\nIn July Jabhat al-Nusra declared it had severed “external” ties with al-Qaeda, and rebranded itself Jabhat Fatah al-Sham (Front for the Conquest of the Levant, or JFS). Western counter-terrorism experts tend to dismiss the move as cosmetic. But in Syria it proved contentious enough that some hardline jihadists left. JFS now seeks a full merger with other rebel groups; purists think that its global ambition will be diluted by the nationalist Syrian rebel agenda. David Petraeus, a former CIA chief, has suggested talking to its “reconcilable” elements. Some are even pushing Staffan de Mistura, the UN special envoy to Syria, to start putting out feelers to the front.\n\n“Al-Nusra is still an integral part of al-Qaeda despite the name change. The danger is that they are acquiring popular support. If it continues to grow then it could become a genuine mass movement,” says Charles Lister of the Brookings Institution, an American think-tank. “With a large enough majority behind them they could establish an emirate, a kind of protected territorial base on the borders of Europe that the international community would find very hard to root out.”\n\nThere is little evidence so far that the group has sought to carry out attacks against the West. Indeed its leader, Abu Muhammad al-Julani, says Mr Zawahiri has expressly forbidden him from doing so. But counter-terrorism officials worry that it is just a matter of time. America has been targeting what it calls the “Khorasan group” within the front, a nucleus of al-Qaeda figures who have moved to Syria and were allegedly plotting international attacks. For the most part, though, American bombing has been directed at IS.\n\nThe front’s fighters have acted as the shock troops of the Sunni rebellion, especially in northern Syria. Its cadre of suicide-bombers, known as inghimasi, was used with devastating effect to breach the Syrian regime’s lines before rebel assaults. “Al-Nusra’s fighters have become to the opposition what Russian and Syrian jets are to the regime,” says a seasoned observer. Soon after its rebranding, JFS was instrumental in breaking the siege of rebel-held Aleppo. The respite was brief but earned JFS the gratitude of many in the city.\n\nOther units have little choice but to work alongside the front. It has attracted many recruits; more than two-thirds of its roughly 7,000 fighters are thought to come from Syria. They see it as a better-trained, better-equipped, more disciplined force that takes greater care of its wounded. It has even drawn fighters from IS.\n\nThough Syrian rebel groups are more or less keeping the ceasefire, few will obey America’s order to separate from JFS. They fear that, should fighting resume—as after an abortive ceasefire in February—Mr Assad’s forces will reclaim territory. Many think strikes against JFS would be like “ripping a vital organ from the body of the revolution”, as one Syria-watcher puts it.\n\nThe softer side of jihadism\n\nLike IS, the front presents itself as a quasi-government in areas where it is dominant. Its Department of Relief paves roads, repairs electricity lines, pumps water and rebuilds damaged infrastructure. To prevent looting, its police guard marketplaces. It subsidises bread, runs flour mills and bakeries, offers Islamic education, provides health care and ensures rents remain low for families displaced by the fighting. At “family fun days” locals compete in games of tug-of-war and enter raffles to win TVs.\n\nMany regard the front as less corrupt than other rebel factions. By controlling the judicial system, and access to marriage certificates and property deeds, it seeks to settle disputes and steer locals towards its ideology. “They don’t intervene in people’s affairs like before. Even around Idlib, their main stronghold, you can see girls and women not wearing the niqab,” says Sami al-Raj, an activist from Aleppo. “Many people consider it the only rebel group that can protect their property and money. You rarely find robbery in the areas it controls.”\n\nAlready in 2013, before the split with IS, Mr Zawahiri was urging moderation on jihadists. Except for some places—such as Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Saudi Arabia—they should as far as possible avoid clashing with local regimes. They should resist fighting “deviant sects” like Shias, and “avoid meddling” with non-Muslim minorities. The priority should be to strike America “until it bleeds to death both militarily and financially”, he said in a public missive. “Our struggle is a long one and jihad is in need of safe bases and consistent support in terms of men, finances and expertise.”\n\nThe move from avoiding unnecessary friction to taking care of populations is a new stage in al-Qaeda’s pragmatism, which has been visible in Yemen, too. With the collapse into civil war last year, caused by Shia rebels’ armed takeover of much of the country and a Saudi-led intervention to push them back, al-Qaeda took control of the port of al-Mukhalla. It kept it running, levying taxes on oil imports. It administered the city through existing tribal structures. Supplies of water and electricity increased. Visitors described security as better than elsewhere in Yemen. “They wanted to show that they could rule better than anyone else,” says Elisabeth Kendall of Oxford University. By and large, she says, they succeeded.\n\nIn April, though, special forces from the United Arab Emirates, with the reported help of American ones, put an end to al-Qaeda’s “Hadramawt province”. Its fighters moved east into al-Mahra, prompting internecine fighting for control of smuggling routes into Oman. Far from the rivalry in Syria, al-Qaeda is flirting with a nascent IS offshoot in Yemen.\n\nHarried by American strikes, and more involved in local conflicts, jihadists have not been able to attack the West on the scale of 9/11. But 15 years on, says Nicholas Rasmussen of America’s Counterterrorism Centre, “the array of terrorist actors around the world is broader, wider and deeper than at any time since that day.”\n\nIS and al-Qaeda may yet swap roles. If and when the IS caliphate is destroyed, say Western officials, it might go global, dispersing among its regional franchises, or turning to full-blown international jihad. It would thus become a bit like the al-Qaeda of yesteryear. And if there is no reasonable settlement to the war in Syria, al-Qaeda will plant stronger local roots. Its future emirate, should it come to it, may be more firmly supported by the local population, and therefore even harder to extirpate, than the barbarous IS caliphate.",

In addition to talking about that film, Dreyfuss briefly discussed his participation in the thriller Red and Piranha 3-D, where he reprises one of the roles that made him famous, Jaws’ enthusiastic ichthyologist Matt Hooper. The actor, who at 62 no longer has time for varnished truth, offered the following unusually candid details about his involvement in the pair of upcoming projects.\n\nHollywood News: You indicated you like a comfortable set.

But, I was only on the film for about four days.\n\nHollywood News: What is your role in the film?\n\nDreyfuss: The political cabinet member villain. Apparently, that’s what I do, nowadays.\n\nHollywood News: Why did you take a role in Piranha 3-D? Was that a tribute to Jaws?\n\nDreyfuss: I had said no because I didn’t want to make fun of my own career. I was on the phone with Bob Weinstein and he said, “We can give you a lot more money,” and I told him what I was involved in. I was describing to him this [idea of] bringing civics back, so that people understood their own civic authority. Because if we’re bound only by ideas and don’t teach them, we’re not bound. And, he interrupted and said, “If it hadn’t already been written, I would have said, ‘You had me at civics.’” He wrote a check that was this big to the Initiative, and I said, “Okay, I’ll do the film.” And their names are going to be on the bottom of the website, permanently.\n\nHollywood News: Who do you play in the film?\n\nDreyfuss: I play Matt Hooper. I play the older Matt Hooper, who escaped being eaten by the shark and is now eaten by a bunch of piranha fish.\n\nHollywood News: Was it an opportunity for you to bring some gravitas to something that might otherwise be superficial fun?\n\nDreyfuss: No, it was an opportunity to get money into the Initiative.\n\nThe Lightkeepers opens in limited release on May 7.

Bazemore, 41, of the Bronx, was charged with felony assault and criminal possession of a weapon.Authorities said Bazemore has been linked to at least one other slashing, a New Year's Day attack in the Bronx. In that incident, he is accused of cutting a woman's face with a razor blade near Bruckner Boulevard. The 28-year-old victim sustained a 3-inch slash on her left cheek that required 150 stitches. Charges against Bazemore are pending.He is now being investigated in at least two more unsolved attacks. In one incident, also in the Bronx, one woman was cut and another was punched. On Nov. 4 in Midtown, a woman was struck with a bag. New York City Police Department detectives are continuing their investigations.The victim in Wednesday's attack, 24-year-old Amanda Morris from Brooklyn, said she was walking to work at 5:50 a.m. at West 23rd Street near Seventh Avenue when she was approached by a man. \"He was kind of stumbling around,\" she said. \"I could tell that he didn't really have anywhere he was going specifically. He was just kind of out there, waiting for something. I guess waiting for me.\"Out of nowhere, Morris said the man slashed her on the left side of her face, then fled.Chief of Detectives Robert Boyce said while the suspect has no public record of mental illness, his family members are telling detectives that he is ill.\"If you could see his actions prior to both instances, you could see a man clearly in emotional distress,\" he said. Bazemore has 32 arrests dating back to 1997.On Dec. 30, Bazemore was arrested for allegedly punching a 32-year-old woman in the face at Sixth Avenue and West 12th Street, causing some bruising to her right cheek and eye. He was charged with misdemeanor assault in that case and released without bail later that day.In August 2013, he was charged in two forcible touching incidents on consecutive days in the East Village. He also has a February 2014 grand larceny arrest and a weapons possession arrest.The victim in this week's incident was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she received seven stitches on her face. She has a gash above and below her lip, and she said she had never seen the suspect before and never said a word to him.Bazemore's clothes had evidence of the slashing, according to the NYPD, so when he was led away from the 13th Precinct Thursday night, on his way to arraignment, he wore a white jumpsuit provided by police. Bazemore was undergoing a psychiatric evaluation at Bellevue Hospital.",

  "latent_24472": "— A major Democratic fundraiser who played a role in a couple of Gov. Terry McAuliffe’s more colorful and controversial moments has stepped up to make the first big donation to the governor's political action committee.\n\nMark Weiner, a Rhode Island marketing executive, wrote a $10,000 check last week to Common Good VA.\n\nWeiner and McAuliffe are longtime friends who have worked together in business and national Democratic politics, producing McAuliffe’s short-lived gig as a QVC pitchman for Democratic National Committee bling and facilitating one of his bigger campaign headaches, over an investment that allowed McAuliffe to profit from a stranger’s death.\n\nMichael Halle, adviser to Common Good VA, said the donation was not the PAC’s first, just the first large enough to trigger immediate disclosure. There have been more than 50 other donations, all under $10,000, he said.\n\n“This donation came from a longtime national political donor who has supported causes and campaigns across the country for years,” Halle said.\n\nIn 1997, McAuliffe co-chaired a committee that gave Weiner exclusive rights to sell merchandise to mark President Bill Clinton’s second inauguration.\n\nAt Weiner’s suggestion, McAuliffe sold the commemorative coins, T-shirts and other items on the QVC television shopping channel. The sales job was “probably my lowest moment in American politics,” McAuliffe wrote in his autobiography, “What a Party!”\n\nWeiner popped up during last fall’s campaign, when it was disclosed that McAuliffe had profited from an investment scheme that involved betting on the lives of terminally ill patients. Weiner had introduced McAuliffe to Joseph Caramadre, the Rhode Island estate planner convicted of stealing the identities of terminally ill patients as part of the scheme.\n\nThere was no indication that McAuliffe or other investors were aware that patients were sometimes duped into participating.\n\nDuring the campaign, McAuliffe made a charitable donation of $74,000, an amount representing the $47,000 he said he reaped from the deal as well as a $27,000 donation Caramadre had made to the Democrat’s failed 2009 bid for governor.\n\n“When the Governor was made aware of the annuities scheme he immediately donated all profits to charity,” Halle said in an e-mail.Weiner’s largesse to Common Good VA drew immediate criticism from Republicans, who had already slammed the newly created PAC for bluntly promising donors access to McAuliffe and unspecified “policy experts.”\n\n“This might be a record. Most PACs manage to get at least one donation in the door before it becomes connected to some sort of scandal,” said Garren Shipley. “But this is just par for the course with Terry McAuliffe. Virginians expect better than this.”\n\nFor $10,000, Weiner could count on attending spring and fall PAC retreats, participating in a roundtable discussion with the governor and attending monthly meetings with “policy experts.”\n\nFor ten times that amount, a donor would also get access to other events, including a private spring reception with the governor and first lady and a private dinner with the McAuliffes in late fall.\n\nThere is nothing new about Virginia governors creating PACs to fund like-minded candidates, or donors paying a premium to mingle with political figures at VIP receptions. But McAuliffe’s critics said he was more bluntly selling access with packages of seemingly intimate sit-down meetings with him and experts .\n\nHalle said that the experts would not be members of the administration. He said the PAC was in line with “standard” fund-raising practices.\n\nFormer governor Robert F. McDonnell (R) has invoked McAuliffe’s PAC as part of his defense in a federal corruption case. McDonnell, who is accused of setting up meetings with state officials and taking other actions to benefit a businessman who showered his family with gifts, has said he did nothing more than provide the courtesies normally extended to donors. The former governor says in court filings that the McAuliffe PAC lays out what is plainly known in politics: money buys access — often legally.",
  "latent_24504": "The NFL draft is over and Sam Bradford remains on the Philadelphia Eagles' roster.\n\nA trade request is still live, however, and Bradford has skipped the start of offseason workouts. With coach Doug Pederson installing a new offense, the starting quarterback skipping meetings is problematic.\n\n\"Anybody that's not in any of the 32 offseason programs is losing valuable time at that club,\" Pederson admitted on Saturday night, via CSN Philly. \"Anybody that's not in the offseason program, yes, would lose the time.\"\n\nWith Chase Daniel well-versed in the system, Bradford missing time could put him behind the eight ball when it comes time to battle for the starting spot. Yes, the Eagles have continued to insist Bradford is the starter, but that doesn't mean things can't change when they hit the field for training camp.\n\nPederson was asked at what point Bradford loses the role of starter, especially if the quarterback misses a lot of time.\n\n\"I think it depends on when he does come back and how fast we can catch him up and put him in that situation and see where he's at, at that time,\" Pederson said. \"Again, nobody makes the team in April. We're not making any roster adjustments and letting people go. It's all about evaluation and he's in that evaluation process. But as I've said in the past, he was one, Chase is two and we're moving on from there.\"\n\nWith Carson Wentz drafted as the future of the franchise, perhaps Bradford sitting out this spring in protest might be good for the No 2 overall pick. Without Bradford gobbling up snaps, Wentz should get more reps -- which he needs -- and one-on-one tutoring.\n\nPederson said he hasn't spoken to Bradford recently, but reiterated the team isn't looking to get rid of the quarterback.\n\n\"In regards to Sam, obviously, he's still on the roster,\" Pederson said. \"We mentioned before he's not going anywhere, he's our guy. And I look forward to the day he comes back. It's unfortunate the situation, but it's also a voluntary process, as you know. You can't do much about that. The minute he comes back, we catch him up and we just keep on going forward.\"\n\nThe Eagles hold all the cards, especially after the Denver Broncos and New York Jets drafted quarterbacks. Bradford sitting out in protest at this point only hurts his chances of actually keeping a starting job for 2016.",
  "latent_24807": "At least 60 people have died from an outbreak of the Ebola virus in Guinea. This particular outbreak has moved from the jungle to Guinea's capital city, Conakry, and reportedly crossed into Liberia and Sierra Leone.\n\nThe virus is transmitted by blood or other body fluids. Victims bleed internally and externally. The fatality rate can reach 90 percent, according to the World Health Organization. To learn more, we spoke to Ian Lipkin, the John Snow Professor of Epidemiology at Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health in New York City.\n\nHow do humans contract this virus?\n\nThe original source is likely to be an affected animal—a bat or sometimes a primate. In the preface to human outbreaks, we see the loss of gorillas and other great apes in the vicinity where people become ill. We haven't heard anything of that sort [regarding the loss of primates in this outbreak]. (Related: \"Ebola in Uganda: Why Can't We Cure It? Where Does It Hide?\")\n\nWhat causes the virus to move from animals to people?\n\nThe initial infection is through bush meat. If there are infected bats—or primates used as protein—in the process of butchering them, a person gets in contact with blood.\n\nHow does it move from person to person?\n\nIt's not easily transmitted. But there's this ritual behavior [in some areas, where] they wash bodies by hand to prepare for burial—a loving way of sending the spirit into the next world. This kind of behavior brings people into very close contact with body fluids that are infected, and that's how people become infected.\n\nTypically these outbreaks are relatively easy to control if you can get people to stop washing dead bodies.\n\nWhat about sexual contact?\n\nThere's some evidence of sexual spread, but I don't think that's a major issue. The major way it's spread is by butchering of infected animals and ritual funeral practices.\n\nIn this case, the virus seems to be moving—from rural regions into Guinea's capital, and across borders.\n\nThat's a little bit unusual and suggests a human carrier. These outbreaks typically occur in jungles or rural areas where people come in contact with bush meat.\n\nIt will be interesting as we do the postmortem [on the Guinea outbreak] to figure out how it crossed borders. It suggests to me probably [the transportation of] a dead body was involved. When an individual dies in a given area, if his relatives take care of him or her in that location, it doesn't spread any further. If they decide they want to move the body to bury it someplace else or somebody who lives in the city goes out to the country and takes care of someone and returns to the city, they may bring the infection with them.\n\nIs Ebola always fatal?\n\nThere are cases where people survive, but it's an extremely dangerous infection. The majority of people who show signs of infection die.\n\nCan the disease be treated?\n\nWe don't really have any good drugs. People are working on this.\n\nWould a vaccine work?\n\nThe thing about vaccines is you don't generally vaccinate people for something that doesn't occur commonly. Even if you have a vaccine that is effective, there's always a potential risk associated with using vaccines. What may make more sense is to bring [treatment] online when people have been infected. There's a lot of emphasis on therapeutic antibodies from people who've survived infection, which could create instant immunization, or drugs that can prevent the virus from replicating. There's nothing on the market as yet. But in some of the animal models, people have infected the animals and then vaccinated them and achieved protection.\n\nWill this new outbreak be contained at some point?",
  "latent_24836": "Sold-out crowds braved extremely cold temperatures Friday and Saturday night at Buttermilk for a string of X Games musical performances that ranged from extraordinary to extraordinarily dull.\n\nOn the upside, Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals put on a phenomenal genre-hopping show in their local debut. While on the other end of the spectrum, the hit-making DJ duo The Chainsmokers played a lazy, lifeless and confounding set.\n\nThe reported wind chill temperature at Buttermilk was -7 on Friday night when Bassnectar took the stage and kicked off the concert series.\n\n\"Everybody take a layer off,\" the Bay Area EDM superstar deadpanned early on.\n\nAlone on a stage plastered in massive LED screens, mixing songs behind shooting fireballs, lasers and smoke cannons, his painstaking performance was a master class for how to piece together a 75-minute festival-style set. There were no lulls in the action as he varied his tempos, mashed up pop songs and reimagined his own productions.\n\nHe kept the capacity crowd of Bassheads dancing and involuntarily vibrating from the body-quaking bass as he remixed familiar tracks from the Bassnectar catalog — including a trippy, standout take on \"The Matrix\" — along with showcasing some unreleased material and new mashups.\n\nRecommended Stories For You\n\nDuring a bassed-up passage mixing Pharcyde's \"Passin' Me By\" and The Fugees' \"Fu-Gee-La,\" the Navy Parachute Team made a surprise appearance overhead. They leapt from a plane and sailed over the crowd, trailing fireworks as they swooped down, one of them unfurling a massive American flag before landing beside the superpipe. Between that, the on-stage pyrotechnics and the high drama of Bassnectar's signature noise-metal electronic style, it was quite literally a spectacular show.\n\nSaturday's bill opened at dusk with a buoyant, virtuosic hourlong sprint of a performance from Anderson .Paak & The Free Nationals. They moved smoothly between hip-hop, funk, jazz and rock (with a dash of disco). Playing to a thinner crowd than the primetime acts, the versatile rapper, drummer and bandleader —with a three-piece band and a DJ — gave X Games the musical high point of the weekend.\n\nHe opened with the funky hip-hop hit \"Come Down\" and stayed in that milieu for \"Milk n' Honey\" and \"Drugs\" before moving to the drums and heading into more adventurous terrain exploring different styles.\n\n\"I can't feel my hands, y'all!\" he cried with a laugh as he first sat down at his drum kit — the sun and the temperature going down quickly.\n\nHe and The Free Nationals played a funked-up take on \"The Season,\" showcasing .Paak rapping and drumming simultaneously and guitarist Jose Reyes playing a soaring classic rock guitar line. That transitioned into a partly improvised spoken word version of the sneaker story \"Carry Me,\" which led into a hard funk take on \"Put Me Thru\" and the upbeat R&B of \"Heart Don't Stand a Chance.\" From there, .Paak hopped off the drum kit and went back into emcee mode, standing center stage to spit the labyrinthine rhymes of \"The Waters.\" Later, on \"Miss Right,\" he went around the horn in the jazz tradition, giving everybody in the band a solo.\n\nAnd that's how all of this powerhouse hourlong set went, with .Paak moving seamlessly between modes and styles until he ended his encore with a disco funk rendition of \"Luh You.\"\n\nHe oozed charm and talent, didn't use any pre-recorded vocals and blew the X Games crowd away with meticulous musicianship.\n\nA few hours later, when The Chainsmokers took the stage, the difference was stark.\n\nThe electronic music duo's fans have spun their infectious \"Don't Let Me Down\" more than a billion times on YouTube and The Chainsmokers have several songs with Spotify streams numbering in the hundreds of millions. They know how to produce an earworm of a pop song. But their live show is a mess.\n\nWhereas Bassnectar played for more than an hour nonstop, with seamless transitions, nuggets of fan favorites, thoughtful mashups and steady build-ups to the big bass drops, The Chainsmokers stumbled through a clunky set of fits and starts while making many creative choices that were downright bonkers (when did it become OK for any DJ — outside of a bar mitzvah ­— to un-ironically play Kiss' \"I Wanna Rock N Roll All Night\" unaltered and yell at a crowd to dance?).\n\nAnd where Anderson .Paak genre-hopped flawlessly between rap and jazz, rock and R&B within a unified creative vision and with a consistent voice, The Chainsmokers just threw a careless grab bag of pre-packaged sounds at their audience.\n\nThey fist-pumped. They sort of danced. They lip-synched a bit. But mostly Drew Taggart and Alex Pall just let tracks play from their little-touched soundboards. Occasionally they yelled into the microphone in various combinations of numbers and words like \"Aspen,\" \"X Games,\" \"ready\" and \"go.\" To wit: \"1, 2, 3, let's go!\" and \"4, 3, 2, 1, go!\" and \"X f—ing Games!\" and \"Are you ready for the treble bass!\"\n\nThis show felt like the sonic equivalent of a frozen, microwaveable Guy Fieri meal — all empty calories and spice and no flavor.\n\nThat said, I don't disparage any of the more than 6,000 X Gamers who had fun dancing in the snow during The Chainsmokers' set. It's a blast to sing along with a big crowd as hits like \"Don't Let Me Down\" and \"Kanye\" and \"Paris\" and \"Closer\" play on a pristine sound system, with a laser light show going overhead and cartoons playing on big screens. Given how little they did musically onstage, I'm just not convinced the actual Chainsmokers had to be there to do it. It might have been a decent show if they hadn't been.\n\natravers@aspentimes.com",

  "latent_24867": "BUSINESS\n\nMinister of Science, ICT and Future Planning Choi Mun-kee calls on public servants to devise measures to overhaul public authentication and ActiveX online systems as part of the government’s deregulatory plans last Saturday. (Yonhap)\n\nWhat does it take for both domestic and foreign consumers to log in and buy items on Korean e-commerce sites?The answer is “patience.”There are about a dozen steps to go through to download security programs, set up personal authentication functions and enter personal information, and on some low-end computers this can take ages.Furthermore, they need to agree to a long list of conditions and hand over sensitive data such as resident registration numbers before typing in their credit card numbers to make the actual purchases.This cumbersome process legally requires downloading ActiveX by Microsoft, software that has recently become embroiled in renewed controversy.ActiveX was introduced in the late 1990s, and embedding this so-called public authentication system only via Windows’ Internet Explorer has made Korea the “Hermit IT Kingdom,” according to some.They argue that overregulation over such certification systems has not only hindered innovation and investment in online security but also widened the security loopholes, making the closed IT society vulnerable to hacking and data theft.“Companies were too focused on spending money to maintain the systems under the regulatory environment, instead of allocating their resources to real important things such as creating advanced encryption software for security,” said an industry source in the mobile sector.The long process of authenticating their ID and downloading ActiveX still leaves personal records that hackers can get ahold of while users type in their data and move on to the next step.“Amazon has a one-click system allowing consumers to easily purchase items without having to rerecord their credit card information (as it is allowed to store such data through protective software),” another source said.Amazon also does not require Social Security numbers for any users.“But Korean sites make consumers retype their card numbers whenever they try to purchase goods, while keeping their registration numbers in their database.”The Park Geun-hye administration is seeking to overhaul this widely outdated system that has only made Korea’s Internet sector less competitive than foreign players and more vulnerable to online theft.The plan calls for the mobilization of key government agencies including the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning; the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy; and the Prime Minister’s Office to draw a roadmap to remove and ease about 20 percent of regulations by 2016.This would include fine-tuning and refining the ID authentication and ActiveX systems to allow foreign online consumers to purchase Korean goods worth over 300,000 won ($278) using just their credit cards, even through different browsers.Foreigners currently need a foreign registration number issued by a financial institution to use an e-commerce site in Korea via Windows’ IE browser.This restriction has led to only a small amount of domestic online purchases by foreign consumers, while boosting Korean visits to overseas sites. Foreigners bought online goods worth only 200 billion won in Korea last year. In contrast, Koreans spent about 1 trillion won on overseas online shopping in 2013, according to media reports.Sources reiterated that regulations should be reformed by concentrating on whether the online sector is upholding data protection measures through improved software capability, instead of keeping it in check through authentication and ActiveX system operations.By Park Hyong-ki ( hkp@heraldcorp.com",
  "latent_24898": "HOUSTON – Owner\n\nand general manager Gavin Wilkinson are in Houston, where the Major League Soccer All-Star Game will be played today, representing the\n\nat MLS meetings. Commissioner Don Garber spoke to The Oregonian Tuesday about Portland's entry to MLS and other subjects related to the league.\n\nQ.\n\nHow excited is the league about Portland joining MLS next year?\n\nA. We're very excited. Portland has a great soccer tradition and some of the best fans in the nation. We've have been in constant communication with Merritt and we think he and his staff are doing a terrific job. We're looking forward to next season.\n\nQ. Will MLS take advantage of the rivalry that exists between the three Northwest teams?\n\nA. When both Portland and Vancouver start next year, we will have three of the great rivalries in sports. Seattle, Portland and Vancouver are clubs that have been longtime rivals and I think that's going to alter the focus from the traditional matches in the East and shift some of the attention to the Northwest.\n\nQ. Considering the two new clubs are located in the west, will there some be some realignment in the league conferences and will Portland, Seattle and Vancouver remain in the Western Conference?\n\nA. Yes, there will be realignment, and those three clubs will stay in the west. We know that two teams from the west will have to be moved to the east, but we don't which ones yet.\n\nQ. Any concern about the renovations to PGE Park and the fact that it's not a facility that is being built from the ground up?\n\nA. None at all. One thing that we now know is that some of our most successful stadiums are the ones that are located in or close to downtown. And you can't get any more downtown than PGE Park. The stadium has its own soccer history that goes back many years and we're looking forward to continuing that tradition.\n\nQ. What are the chances the Portland could host an MLS All-Star game or MLS Cup in the future?\n\nA. We've been in discussions with Merritt about bringing a MLS special event to Portland. I'm sure that we'll be able to do that. It's just a matter of time before we finalize just what that event will be.\n\nWe, for sure, are really looking forward to coming to Portland with some big-time events. Not just All-Star games and Cups, but some big-time international matches that our marketing company would promote.\n\nQ. You have been quoted as saying that you hope Landon Donovan remains in MLS, how does he help the league?\n\nA. Landon is our greatest ambassador. He's a great player on the field and a great person off the field. I would love for him to finish his career in MLS, but ultimately, I don't have any control over what he does. But as commissioner, I would like for him to help us continue to grow the game of soccer in the United States, and he would be more effective doing that by playing in the United States, not in Europe.\n\nI think Landon's performance in the World Cup has put him at a level that he is now past just being a soccer star. He's now a sports star and he serves as an example of someone who is associated with our league and attracts attention to Galaxy, our teams and our league.\n\nQ. How important is it for MLS to develop home-grown stars?\n\nA. It's very important. We want our clubs to develop a strong youth academy and through those academies develop young players who will want to play for their local MLS club. That kind of story is something we all want for our clubs, because that's the kind of story that can inspire other youths to play our sport.\n\nQ.\n\nWith the signing of French star Thierry Henry by the New York Red Bulls, there have been a lot of rumors about another big star coming to MLS, Ronaldinho. Can you tell us if he will be coming to MLS soon?\n\nI've read those rumors, I'm not quite sure where they're coming from. Maybe one of our board members might have said he heard that one of our teams is looking at him. But as far as I know, Ronaldinho is under contract to AC Milan. I've got great respect for him and should he ever decide that he's interested in our league, we would certainly be interested in talking to him. Those discussions would only happen when he at the end of his agreement or not under contract.\n\nQ. How do you counter the criticism that MLS is a sort of a retirement home for aging international stars?\n\nA. We just signed a Mexican player in his mid-20s (Chicago Fire signed 26-year-old Mexican striker Nery Castillo last week) and at the peak of his career. I think there will always be some young players and some older players that have come to MLS at the end of their careers. But we have some great young players here as well. ...You look at the way we do our entire league roster pool, not just the handful of guys who make the news.\n\nQ. By the time 2012 comes, the league will have added four new teams (Portland, Vancouver, Philadelphia and Montreal (2012). Are you concerned the league is expanding too quickly?\n\nA. We see the expansion as slow and steady growth, not rapid growth. This is the way we prefer to grow the league, with slow and consistent growth. Our attendance is strong, we have new stadiums that have been built or being built in Portland, Kansas City, Philadelphia, Los Angeles, New York, Canada and other cities. We have long-term television deals. The league has a very good financial foundation to grow in the future. We want to eventually go to 20 to 24 teams, continue to develop players from the United States and attract top international players. We feel we can do that in the future.",
  "latent_24911": "The Israeli government’s approval of an $86 million plan for tightening its grip over occupied East Jerusalem is the latest development in a process of colonisation that continues to proceed with impunity.\n\nAccording to an article in Haaretz, the five-year investment plan will fund “a number of actions with the declared purpose of thwarting any possibility that the city would be divided as part of a future accord”. The newspaper described it as “similar in nature to Economy Minister Naftali Bennett’s proposal to annex Area C of the West Bank”.\n\nThe origins of the report approved by Netanyahu’s cabinet Sunday are in a ministerial discussion last year on “the increase in nationalistically motivated rock-throwing and other violent incidents” in East Jerusalem. This meeting led to a fact-finding committee headed by cabinet secretary Avichai Mendelblit, and including representatives of the Prime Minister’s Office, Housing Ministry, the Shin Bet, Jerusalem District police, and the city municipality, among others.\n\nThe committee’s recommendations included assigning the five-year investment plan to the responsibility of Naftali Bennett, in his capacity as Minister of Jerusalem and Diaspora Affairs, as well as to his ministry’s director-general Dvir Kahana. This is a man who used to visit Palestinian communities and threaten them with expulsion.\n\nThe overriding emphasis of the plan is on ‘security’, as illustrated by the motivation for the report and the nature of its key recommendations. The cabinet-backed report speaks of “uncompromising enforcement and punishment against those who seek to undermine Israeli control in [East Jerusalem]”, with the government expected to seek “amendments to the penal code that would mandate stiffer penalties for the offense of throwing rocks at police officers, civilians or vehicles”.\n\nOther recommendations include “more police officers” and “additional security cameras”, as well an upgrade of “the protection at compounds of Jewish settlers”. This increase in “police and surveillance presence in East Jerusalem” comes as the cabinet pointed to “390 incidents of stone-throwing” in the annexed areas March-April 2014 – so-called “offences with nationalist characteristics“. Thus a full third of the initiative’s budget is designated for “increasing personal security” in East Jerusalem – what, as one analyst put it, is clearly a reference to the security of “the settlers living in the heart of Palestinian neighbourhoods”.\n\nThe plan also promises a survey of public infrastructure in East Jerusalem to be followed by an upgrade as required, as well as funding for schools, employment opportunities, and welfare services. Yet even these elements cannot be untangled from the bigger picture; as Bennett put it, “young people are easily influenced and are more inclined to take part in violent, nationalist or other activities”.\n\nMoreover, the proposed investment in infrastructure in Palestinian areas of East Jerusalem is a drop in the ocean. As NGO Ir Amin pointed out, “NIS 2 billion is required to bring east Jerusalem’s infrastructure into fair condition”, yet “the government decided to spend only one-tenth of that within the next five years”.\n\nThe new plan for East Jerusalem then, is a typically colonial initiative that seeks to crush resistance to occupation with one hand, while offering the crumbs of economic ‘incentives’ with the other. It is part and parcel of decades of Judaisation and colonial settlement exhaustively documented by Palestinians, Israeli NGOs, and international observers. Indeed, EU monitors more or less annually condemn Israeli policies such as home demolitions and the revocation of residency permits. In 2012, the emphasis was on the use of sanctions with regards to East Jerusalem settlement activity.\n\nAnd yet, Israel proceeds with impunity. Illegal, unilateral annexation, settlements, the Apartheid Wall, discriminatory housing policies – the new plan is certainly consistent with the government and municipality’s track record. Will the international community, and in particular the EU, do anything about it? If they do not, they shouldn’t be surprised to see a Netanyahu government proceed with further measures aimed at cementing Israel’s apartheid, de facto one state solution.\n\nThe views expressed in this article belong to the author and do not necessarily reflect the editorial policy of Middle East Monitor.",
  "latent_25009": "I was in my car for the final moments of Saturday's Game 3 between the Atlanta Hawks and Washington Wizards, but one text message told me everything I was missing.\n\nPaul Pierce stepback elbow jumper\n\nI knew immediately that 37-year-old Pierce had just sunk the Hawks with his trademark late-game move, though my friend had clearly undersold the sequence by failing to note that Pierce banked the shot over three Atlanta defenders while saving the Wizards from blowing a 21-point lead.\n\nWhen Pierce bellowed, \"I called game!\" after being asked in an on-court interview whether he called glass on the winner, my phone blew up again. My friends are NBA fans but, more specifically, they are Boston Celtics fans after growing up here and they have thoroughly enjoyed Pierce's postseason exploits with the Wizards.\n\nTo fans here, Pierce will always be a Celtic. In a way, there's this feeling that he's simply on loan to the Wizards, a hired hand while Boston navigates its rebuilding process (which Pierce aided by fetching a ransom from the Brooklyn Nets two years ago).\n\nWe noted earlier this week how, with Boston bowing early in the playoffs, most Celtics fans had hopped on the Wizards bandwagon. Watching Pierce turn back the clocks while trash-talking the Raptors during a first-round sweep made that decision easy for most Boston fans.\n\nNow Pierce has helped the Wizards take a 2-1 series lead over the top-seeded Hawks despite currently playing without star guard John Wall (hand). Celtics fans flocked to social media to celebrate Pierce's heroics and the hashtag \"#icalledgame\" quickly trended in Boston.\n\nOf course it did. Pierce still belongs to Boston. Regardless of his laundry, he's still one of ours.\n\nWhich is a rare thing nowadays. Boston's four major sports teams have won nine total championships over the past 13 years, so Boston fans don't tend to get too sentimental just because an old friend is enjoying some playoff success. Things have certainly changed since Ray Bourque got a parade for winning the Stanley Cup with the Colorado Avalanche in 2001.\n\nPierce might be one of the few guys left in Boston sports who could get a hero's welcome for bringing back a title trophy from another team (and let's not get too far ahead of ourselves considering the Wizards still face an uphill climb in these playoffs, particularly will Wall sidelined).\n\nCeltics fans will simply savor watching vintage Pierce. Even with more than 50,000 minutes on his NBA odometer, Pierce is playing with the confidence of a player half his age. He's found a Fountain of Truth on the court, and has backed up everything he has said.\n\nCeltics fans will keep daydreaming about Pierce finishing out his career in green, even if he's clearly got a good thing going down there in Washington. Boston's young roster needed a veteran presence in falling to LeBron James and the Cavaliers in round 1.\n\nNear the end of his 15 seasons in Boston, Pierce struggled to consistently convert in late-game isolation situations. When Celtics fans texted, \"Paul Pierce stepback elbow jumper\" during his final year here, it was usually a jab about Boston's lack of late-game creativity and the play's lack of success.\n\nBut the play worked Saturday for Pierce and the Wizards. Four hundred and thirty-five miles away, an entire fan base cheered along with Washington fans.",
  "latent_25070": "Opinion\n\nWhat Derby fans have had to say about 2-0 defeat to Newcastle\n\nVery similar to the away match at Bristol City, with Newcastle scoring an excellent early goal and then shutting up shop for the rest of the game.\n\nSo what did the Derby fans make of it all?\n\nMaybe the second goal was a little unfair on the home side to give a two goal margin but surely nobody can argue that Newcastle didn’t deserve to win…or can they?\n\nNigel Pearson argued that Derby were unlucky not to get something but how did his team’s own supporters view it?\n\nHere are a range of views taken from the top Derby fans message board DCFCfans.uk:\n\n‘Newcastle have some good players and picked up on our errors but they didn’t have anything that would make me green with envy.\n\nIn the end a great volley from the corner and a penalty decision was all that separated us from the most likely title contenders.’\n\n‘At least we ran about a lot more than previous games.\n\nHow anyone can turn a decent side into this garbage in such a short time is incredible.’\n\n‘Geordies today were fantastic. A bit chalk and cheese for me. Some are really amazingly friendly dedicated fans and some are just drunken knuckledraggers. Why take your shirt off when you went 1 up? It was your TEAM that scored , not YOU!!’\n\n‘Perfect away performance from Newcastle. And we move on.’\n\n‘Rubbish game of football. I thought we cancelled each other out & a 0-0 bore draw was probably a more fair result.’\n\n‘When Newcastle had the ball there were multiple passing options and we had to make great tackles to win the ball. When we had the ball, there was no one to pass to and we would surrender the ball cheaply or just sideways and back pass. What does that tell you?’\n\n‘Thought the team competed today against what was a really well organised and tactically astute Newcastle side.\n\nToday could have easily been a 0-0. It’s easy to forget that Newcastle were just as poor as we were and had limited opportunities so we were by no means overawed, just that they took their chances when they came around.’\n\n‘Newcastle and villa were relegated for reasons which have nothing to do with their prospects this season. Newcastle had a number of prima donna players , some of who they have sold for vast sums of money. They have strengthened the team sensibly with top championship players. They are the best team in this league and will be promoted for sure. They are not world beaters… They gave the ball away several times today and a better team than the Rams would have capitalised. But they are easily good enough for promotion.’\n\n‘I thought Newcastle were very comfortable. Never had to get out of first gear and for all of our toil and hard work, we never really looked like threatening them.’\n\n‘Newcastle had better players than us all over the pitch.\n\nNewcastle also managed to con some teams into paying well over the odds for some of their players. To compare the spending power of Villa and Newcastle with Burnley and Hull last year is pretty laughable – it was more of a level playing field last year, but its only going to get worse, so we had better get used to it.’\n\n‘Pretty poor stuff today against quite poor opposition.’\n\n‘Watched this with a pub full of toon fans in Whitley Bay. They weren’t impressed with us or them. 2 poor teams with 2 goals that won’t be repeated any time soon. What worries me is the lack of chances created. They were always going to sit back and let us come on to them, what work did we do during the week to try and break them down?’\n\n‘There was nothing in the game, Newcastle converted a half chance (a stunning goal) and a calamity at the end when we only had 3 defenders on the pitch. That was it, we had a couple of half chances and should have had 2 penalties. It could have easily been 0-0. On another day we would have edged it.’\n\n‘I think that was the most disappointing thing, Newcastle weren’t great, I can hardly remember Carson having to make a save….’\n\n‘Newcastle didn’t need to push forward after going 1-0.

  "latent_25216": "\"Sit\" redirects here. For other uses, see Sit (disambiguation)\n\nSitting is a basic human resting position. The body weight is supported primarily by the buttocks in contact with the ground or a horizontal object such as a chair seat. The torso is more or less upright. Sitting for much of the day may pose significant health risks, and people who sit regularly for prolonged periods have higher mortality rates than those who do not.[1]\n\nThe form of kneeling where the thighs are near horizontal and the buttocks sit back on the heels, for example as in Seiza and Vajrasana (yoga), is also often interpreted as sitting.\n\nPrevalence [ edit ]\n\nThe British Chiropractic Association said in 2006 that 32% of the British population spent more than ten hours per day sitting down.[2]\n\nPositions [ edit ]\n\nOn the floor [ edit ]\n\nThe most common ways of sitting on the floor involve bending the knees. One can also sit with the legs unbent, using something solid as support for the back or leaning on one's arms. Sitting with bent legs can be done with the legs mostly parallel or by crossing them over each other.\n\nA common cross-legged position is with the lower part of both legs folded towards the body, crossing each other at the ankle or calf, with both ankles on the floor, sometimes with the feet tucked under the knees or thighs. The position is known in several European languages as tailor style, from the traditional working posture of tailors;[3] compare tailor's bunion. It is also named after various plains-dwelling nomads: in American English Indian style, in many European languages \"Turkish style\", and in Japanese agura (胡座, The sitting style of non-Han ethnics (particularly Turks, Mongols and other Central Asians.)). In yoga it is known as sukhasana.\n\nOn a raised seat [ edit ]\n\nMost raised surfaces at the appropriate height can be used as seats for humans, whether they are made for the purpose, such as chairs, stools and benches, or not. While the buttocks are nearly always rested on the raised surface, there are many differences in how one can hold one's legs and back.\n\nThere are two major styles of sitting on a raised surface. The first has one or two of the legs in front of the sitting person; in the second, sitting astride something, the legs incline outwards on either side of the body.\n\nThe feet can rest on the floor or on a footrest, which can keep them vertical, horizontal, or at an angle in between. They can also dangle if the seat is sufficiently high. Legs can be kept right to the front of the body, spread apart, or one crossed over the other.\n\nThe upper body can be held upright, recline to either side or backward, or one can lean forward.\n\nYoga, traditions, and spirituality [ edit ]\n\nToddler sitting on a bench\n\nThere are many seated positions in various traditions and rituals. Four examples are:\n\nSeiza ( 正座 ) \"correct sitting\" is a Japanese word which describes the traditional formal way of sitting in Japan. A related position is kiza ( 跪座 ) , which differs in the tops of the feet being raised off the ground.\n\nis a Japanese word which describes the traditional formal way of sitting in Japan. A related position is kiza , which differs in the tops of the feet being raised off the ground. Vajrasana (Diamond Pose) is a yoga posture (asana) similar to seiza.\n\nThe lotus position involves resting each foot on the opposite thigh so that the soles of the feet face upwards.\n\nThe Burmese position, named so because of its use in Buddhist sculptures in Burma, places both feet in front of the pelvis with knees bent and touching the floor to the sides. The heels are pointing toward pelvis or upward, and toes are pointed so that the tops of the feet lie on the ground. This looks similar to the cross-legged position, but the feet are not placed underneath the thigh of the next leg, therefore the legs do not cross. Instead, one foot is placed in front of the other.\n\nIn various mythologies and folk magic, sitting is a magical act that connects the person who sits with other persons, states or places.[4]\n\nHealth risks [ edit ]\n\nBack of a sitting nude by school of Rembrandt\n\nIn 1700, De Morbis Artificum Diatriba, listed sitting in odd postures as a cause of diseases in “chair-workers”.[5] Current studies indicate there is a significantly higher mortality rate among people who regularly sit for prolonged periods, and the risk is not negated by regular exercise, though it is lowered.[1][6] The causes of mortality and morbidity include heart disease, obesity, type 2 diabetes and cancer, specifically, breast, endometrial, colorectal, lung, and epithelial ovarian cancer.[1][6][7][8][9] The link between heart disease and diabetes mortality and sitting is well-established, but the risk of cancer mortality is unclear.[8][10] Sedentary time is also associated with an increased risk of depression in children and adolescents.[11] A correlation between occupational sitting specifically and higher body mass index has been demonstrated, but causality has not yet been established.[6] There are several hypotheses explaining why sitting is a health risk. These include changes in cardiac output, vitamin D, inflammation, sex hormone activity, lipoprotein lipase activity, and GLUT4 activity due to long periods of muscular unloading, among others.[6][8][9]\n\nSitting may occupy up to half of an adult's workday in developed countries.[6] Workplace programs to reduce sitting vary in method. They include sit-stand desks, counseling, workplace policy changes, walking/standing meetings, treadmill desks, breaks, therapy ball chairs, and stepping devices.[7][12] Results of these programs are mixed,[7] but there is moderate evidence to show that changes to chairs (adjusting the biomechanics of the chair or using different types of chairs) can effectively reduce musculoskeletal symptoms in workers who sit for most of their day.[13]\n\nPublic health programs typically focus on increasing physical activity rather than reducing sitting time.[1][14] One major target for these public health programs is sitting in the workplace.[7][15][needs update] For example, WHO Europe recommended in September 2015 the provision of adjustable desks in the workplace.[14] In general, there is conflicting evidence regarding the precise risks of sitting for long periods.[6] A 2018 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence that providing employees with a standing desk option may reduce the length of time some people sit at work in the first year.[12] This reduction in sitting may decrease with time, and there is no evidence that standing desks are effective in the long term.[12] In addition, a 2018 British Journal of Medicine systematic review concluded that interventions aimed at reducing sitting outside of work were only modestly effective.[16] It is not clear how standing desks compare to other work-place interventions to reduce the length of time employees are sitting during the work day.[12]\n\nKneeling chairs [ edit ]\n\nThe kneeling chair (often just referred to as \"ergonomic chair\") was designed to encourage better posture than the conventional chair.[qualify evidence] To sit in a kneeling chair, one rests one's buttocks on the upper sloping pad and rests the front of the lower legs atop the lower pad, i.e., the human position as both sitting and kneeling at the same time.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nFurther reading [ edit ]\n\nChau JY, der Ploeg HP, van Uffelen JG, Wong J, Riphagen I, Healy GN, Gilson ND, Dunstan DW, Bauman AE, Owen N, Brown WJ (2010). \"Are workplace interventions to reduce sitting effective?

  "latent_25244": "Marshawn Lynch took a little longer on his way to becoming every other running back, but this weekend, he finally got there. Friday afternoon, Lynch stated his intention to hold out from training camp by calling a former teammate turned TV analyst and having him announce it on-air. Like so many other things with Lynch — his candy, his fury, and being all about that action — he did it his own way. Over the past few years, if Lynch has been anything, he’s been different.\n\nThe thing is, no matter how unique Lynch is as a player and personality, he, like most running backs, is replaceable. At least that seems to be the theory driving the reaction.\n\nOn paper, there are plenty of reasons why that might be true. Even last year, people figured Lynch was on borrowed time in Seattle, because of the team’s balance sheet. His cap figure in 2015 will be $9 million, the third-highest total among running backs, and Seattle would save $7.5 million by cutting him loose. He’ll be 29 by then, with a lot of mileage, and we all know the rules. Giving money to running backs pushing 30 doesn’t turn out very well. Now that Lynch is asking for even more (or really, just some security beyond next season), it feels like the consensus is that he’s even more expendable.\n\nClick here for more from our 2014 NFL preview.\n\nRunning backs do have diminished value, and Lynch is getting older. What’s hard to understand is how Seattle’s success has somehow diminished Lynch’s value, despite his role in it. One of the main points being used in the argument against paying Lynch is that the Seahawks are a team fresh off a championship — a championship won with defense. That’s true for the most part. The Seahawks trotted out one of the best defenses ever last year. That defense dominated in the Super Bowl when Lynch didn’t. He had only 39 yards on his 15 carries, his worst game of the season. But here’s the thing: Seattle had to win two playoff games to get to the Super Bowl, and there Lynch was fantastic, with a combined 249 rushing yards on 50 carries.\n\nIt’s the same way he played all year. His 1,257 rushing yards aren’t mind-blowing, but the way he got them is. According to Football Outsiders, Lynch led the league in broken tackles last year with 59, eight more than anyone else. His broken-tackle rate (17.5 percent of his touches) blew away every other back in the league who got significant work. Pro Football Focus’s elusive rating had only Adrian Peterson as a harder running back to take down.\n\nAnd Lynch did it all with an offensive line that was dinged up and often ineffective. Pro Bowl left tackle Russell Okung missed a chunk of the season with an ankle injury. Pro Bowl center Max Unger had a pedestrian year by his standards. The Seahawks aren’t some run-game machine with parts that can simply be switched in and out. The only thing you could call a machine is Lynch.\n\nWhen Jamaal Charles announced his own holdout last week, some supported his claim by pointing out that he’d accounted for more than 36 percent of his team’s total offense. Lynch may not be quite there, but he did manage 29 percent, which bested Peterson’s 26 percent.\n\nThere’s no denying that Charles had a much better case for wanting to be paid. He was due just $3.65 million this year, and that doesn’t reflect just how great he’s been the past two seasons. He also has about 700 fewer carries than Lynch (two seasons’ worth), even though he’s only eight months younger.\n\nWhat I find most interesting about all of this, though, isn’t whether the Seahawks should actually pay Lynch — the history of running-back holdouts is littered with mistakes, and there’s a good chance a hefty extension for Lynch would be another. But that doesn’t mean he’s disposable. That seems to be how the Seahawks and plenty of others are treating him.\n\nAmong the first reactions to the Lynch news were comments about the skyrocketing fantasy value of Christine Michael. Taken in the second round of last year’s draft, there has been talk that Michael could steal Lynch’s gig for the better part of the year. You’d think that based on what Lynch did last year, people might think twice about how easily a running back we’ve never seen could step in and do his job, but I guess not.\n\nSeattle’s offensive-line situation hasn’t dramatically improved since last year either. Okung is back healthy, and there’s a good chance Unger will be better this year without some of the nagging injuries that slowed him down. But for the most part, the group is still the Seahawks’ biggest question mark. James Carpenter, the former first-round pick who Seattle has seemingly avoided playing whenever possible, is slotted to play left guard while a pair of seventh-round picks (J.R. Sweezy and Michael Bowie) are penciled in on the right side. The Seahawks drafted tackle Justin Britt in the second round, but there’s no telling if he’ll be ready to step in as a rookie.\n\nWhat the Seahawks have to be hoping is that every non–running game part of their roster will be better than it was a year ago. With the passing game, that seems reasonable. Percy Harvin should be around for at least a little while, the Seahawks drafted two receivers in the first four rounds, and Russell Wilson will probably be asked to take on more responsibility.\n\nIt’s the defense that might be getting a little too much credit. Yes, the Seahawks re-upped both Earl Thomas and Richard Sherman this offseason, and there’s no reason to think they won’t have the league’s best secondary yet again. Elsewhere, though, they’ve lost at least some of what made them such a terror a year ago. Seattle’s front was defined by its flexibility, flexibility it has lost by shelling out big money to its stars.\n\nRed Bryant and Chris Clemons weren’t the most important players on Seattle’s defense, but they added versatility the Seahawks will miss. Seattle’s greatest advantage last year was its depth. With the rotating crop of defensive linemen, Michael Bennett could line up at defensive tackle on passing downs and gain a subtle advantage he wouldn’t have outside. Those subtle advantages have vanished in several spots.\n\nThat’s where the gap in the case to jettison Lynch exists. The thinking that surrounds most great teams is that they’ll simply continue to be great. Often, the issue is that what made those teams great is hard to sustain. One of the things that made the Seahawks great was Marshawn Lynch. That seems worth remembering.",

  "latent_25938": "There is a popular belief that women are better than men at multitasking. Although some studies have supported this claim, other scientists have pointed to the insufficient evidence for this generalization. New research supports the former, suggesting it may be more difficult for the male brain to switch between tasks, as it uses more resources to do so.\n\nMen may find it more difficult to switch between tasks, suggests a new study. Men may find it more difficult to switch between tasks, suggests a new study.\n\nWe commonly use the term \"multitasking\" to refer to our brain's ability to perform several tasks at once.\n\nHowever, from a psychological point of view, \"task-switching\" may be a more accurate term. Findings in neuroscience and psychology suggest that during what is commonly referred to as \"multitasking,\" the brain actually performs a task, stops, and switches to the next one, all in a very short span of time.\n\nThere is a popular belief that women are better at task-switching than men, but some scientists have argued that this remains a popular generalization with no scientific evidence to support it. For example, one extensive overview of scientific literature \"could not find a single scientific report to support this view.\"\n\nHowever, other studies suggest women do perform better at least in some multi-tasking paradigms. One such study found women outperformed men in computer-based, task-switching tests, as well as in \"paper-and-pencil\" multitasking tests. Men were also significantly slower in switching between tasks.\n\nNew research looks at how much energy male brains spend when performing task-switching tests, as well as what areas of the brain are activated when doing so.\n\nStudying task-switching in men and women\n\nA new study performed by researchers from the Higher School of Economics (HSE) in Moscow, Russia, looks at gender differences in attention-switching task performance.\n\nThe research was led by Svetlana Kuptsova and Maria Ivanova, from the HSE Neurolinguistic Laboratory.\n\nResearchers examined 140 men and women aged between 20-65, of whom 69 were men.\n\nParticipants were asked to perform a task-switching test inside a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) machine, and blood-oxygen-level-dependent (BOLD) contrast imaging was used to observe activity in the brain.\n\nParticipants were asked to switch attention between two objectives, in a pseudo-random order. They were required to classify figures according to shape, namely round or square, and classify them according to number, i.e. one or two.\n\nResearchers calculated the volumes of gray and white matter in the entire brain and in selected areas.\n\nAdditionally, they conducted neuropsychological tests, such as the D-KEFS Trail Making Test, to measure the participants' attention-switching ability, and the Wechsler Memory Scale Test to measure their auditory and visual memory.\n\nMen use more brain resources to switch between tasks\n\nRegardless of gender or age, task-switching usually activates the dorsolateral prefrontal areas of the brain, the inferior parietal lobes, and the inferior occipital gyrus.\n\nThe study revealed that compared with women, young men aged between 20-30 had greater bilateral activation in the prefrontal areas and higher activity in the right parietal lobe and insula. In addition, men displayed bilateral activation of the supplementary motor area, which was not observed in women.\n\nAge seemed to somewhat impact the results. The observed brain activation was localized in younger adults but became more diffused with age. No correlation between BOLD signals and age was noticed between the ages of 20-40 in women and between 20-55 in men. However, after this age, researchers found an increase in the number of brain areas activated in both men and women.\n\nGender differences also became negligible with age, as researchers did not register any significant differences in men and women aged between 51-65.\n\nFinally, the analysis showed a decrease in gray, but not white matter with age.\n\nThe results of the study was published in the peer-reviewed journal Human Physiology.\n\nMen may find task-switching more difficult\n\nThe research suggests men might find it more difficult to switch between tasks, as the male brain appears to need more brain power when doing this.\n\n\"We know that stronger activation and involvement of supplementary areas of the brain are normally observed in subjects faced with complex tasks. Our findings suggest that women might find it easier than men to switch attention and their brains do not need to mobilize extra resources in doing so, as opposed to male brains.\" Svetlana Kuptsova\n\nAlthough the difference found in reaction time is scientifically relevant, in day-to-day life it is barely noticeable, explains Kuptsova, with the exception of perhaps \"really stressful circumstances or critical situations which require frequent switching of attention.\"\n\nThe reasons for this difference remain unknown. As Kuptsova argues, although evolutionary and social factors might play a role, any assumptions as to why nature might need it are pure speculation.\n\nLearn about how media multitasking has been linked to brain changes.",
  "latent_26113": "If you had any doubts about the level of zealotry involved in today's global warming movement, they likely will be erased by the goings on at PBS the past few days.\n\nSince allowing well-known climate realist Anthony Watts on NewsHour Monday to voice his views on this controversial issue, PBS has been under attack for doing so (videos follows with transcripts and commentary).\n\nThe ten-minute segment began:\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the debate over the magnitude of climate change, its impact, and the human role in it.\n\nTypically, the battle plays out among prominent climate scientists and a vocal group of skeptics. But one skeptic's recent public conversion is adding new fuel to that fire and sparking criticism from both sides.\n\n\"NewsHour\" correspondent Spencer Michels has the story.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Physicist Richard Muller and his daughter, Elizabeth, a mathematician, are not exactly household names.\n\nBut in the world of climate change, where most scientists and a much smaller group of skeptics remain bitterly divided over their assessment of what's happening to the planet, Richard Muller has long been on the side of those who deny climate change is happening.\n\nSo, when he published an op-ed in The New York Times last month saying he was no longer a skeptic, it captured national attention and sparked angry reaction on both sides of the climate fence.\n\nHere were Watts's contributions:\n\nSPENCER MICHELS, HOST: Yet, many of those believers were annoyed that Muller's conversion got more attention in the media than their reports have gotten in the past. They dismissed him as being publicity-hungry and adding nothing new to the debate.\n\nClimate modeler and British Green Party member William Connolley called Muller's study rubbish, saying they hadn't added any knowledge to what had been done before. Skeptics were even more dismissive of Muller`s work.\n\nJudith Curry, professor of earth sciences at Georgia Tech, who suspects natural variability accounts for climate change, not human- produced CO2, said Muller`s analysis is \"way oversimplistic and not at all convincing.\"\n\nEven former ally Anthony Watts thinks Muller got it wrong. Watts works five hours from Muller in Chico, California. There, he runs a company supplying data and display systems to television weather forecasters and private individuals. He was trained as a broadcast meteorologist, though he has authored some papers with academic researchers.\n\nHis blog, Watts Up With That?, bills itself as the world's most viewed sight on global warming and climate change. Watts believes all climate warming data, Muller's included, is off because weather stations where temperatures are recorded have soaked up heat from their surroundings.\n\nANTHONY WATTS, Meteorologist: A brick building that's been out in the summer sun, you stand next to it at night, you can feel the heat radiating off of it. That's a heat sink effect. We have got more freeways, you know, more airports. We have got more buildings.\n\nYes, we have some global warming. It's clear the temperature has gone up in the last 100 years, but what percentage of that is from carbon dioxide and what percentage of that is from the changes in the local and measurement environment?\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: He also thinks believers have a hidden agenda.\n\nANTHONY WATTS: Global warming has become essentially a business in its own right. There are whole divisions of universities that are set up to study this factor. And so there's lots of money involved. And so I think that there`s a tendency to want to keep that going and not really look at what might be different.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: It's a charge climate change believers say is totally false. But many do agree with Watts' criticism of Muller for presenting his report in a newspaper, rather than in a scientific journal.\n\nANTHONY WATTS: He has not succeeded in terms of how science views, you know, a successful inquiry. His papers have not passed peer review. [...]\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: And polls conducted by Gallup and other news organizations suggest the issue ranks lower on voters' top priorities. Watts says polls can be manipulated by how the question is asked. He's worried that those who believe in manmade climate change will have their way in Washington.\n\nANTHONY WATTS: Some of the issues have been oversold. And they have been oversold because they allow for more regulation to take place. And so the people that like more regulation use global warming as a tool as a means to an end. And so, as a result, we might be getting more regulation and more taxes that really aren't rooted in science, but more in politics.\n\nPretty innocuous stuff. In fact, the entire segment was surprisingly balanced offering views from both sides of this contentious debate.\n\nAnd therein lies the problem for climate alarmists, especially as a blog was posted by Michels with video including a more extensive discussion with Watts:\n\nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration sent a response to PBS:\n\nThe American public can be confident in NOAA’s long-standing surface temperature record, one of the world’s most comprehensive, accurate and trusted data sets. This record has been constructed through many innovative methods to test the robustness of the climate data record developed and made openly available for all to inspect by NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center. Numerous peer-reviewed studies conclusively show that U.S. temperatures have risen and continue to rise with recent widespread record-setting temperatures in the USA. There is no doubt that NOAA’s temperature record is scientifically sound and reliable. To ensure accuracy of the record, scientists use peer-reviewed methods to account for all potential inaccuracies in the temperature readings such as changes in station location, instrumentation and replacement and urban heat effects.\n\nSpecifically, NOAA’s National Climatic Data Center published a scientific peer-reviewed paper (Menne, et al., 2010) that compared trends from stations that were considered well-sited and stations that received lower ratings on siting conditions, which found that the U.S. average temperature trend is not inflated by poor station siting. A subsequent research study led by university and private sector scientists reached the same conclusion (Fall et al. 2011). Additionally, the Department of Commerce Inspector General reviewed the US Historical Climatology Network dataset in July 2010 and concluded that “the respondents to our inquiries about the use of and adjustments to the USHCN data generally expressed confidence in the [USHCN] Version 2 dataset.”\n\nLooking ahead to the next century, NOAA has implemented the U.S. Climate Reference Network (USCRN) – with 114 stations across the contiguous United States located in pristine, well-sited areas. Comparing several years of trends from the well-sited USCRN stations with USHCN shows that the temperature trends closely correspond – again validating the accuracy of the USHCN U.S. temperature record.\n\nAnd that brought out the zealots. Climate Progress's Joe Romm was global warming alarmist on the spot:\n\nIf you happened to be watching the PBS News Hour tonight, you probably thought the show had been hijacked by Fox News. At first, their climate segment seemed to be about Koch-funded former “skeptic” Richard Muller and his conversion to scientific reality.\n\nBut then PBS decided that the way to “balance” a former skeptic who merely confirmed what climate scientists have demonstrated repeatedly for decades was by quoting nonsense from Sen. James Inhofe and then giving an extended interview to former TV weatherman and current A-list disinformer Anthony Watts.\n\nThe New York Times' Andrew Revkin observed (HT Tom Nelson):\n\nSurreally softball @newshour Q&A with @Wattsupwiththat’s A. Watts. For starters, might have been worth asking about research showing Watts stock-in-trade surface station issues don’t significantly affect global warming finding.\n\nThe propagandists at DeSmogBlog followed (HT Climate Depot):\n\nPBS – the network that conservatives have regularly attacked for “liberal bias” for more than 40 years – finally put that myth to rest tonight by airing a one-sided interview with climate change denier Anthony Watts. The former weatherman-turned business owner and blogger Watts, was given close to ten minutes of uncontested airtime to spout his disinformation about climate change, without any retorts from actual climate scientists.\n\nThe global warming advocacy group Forecast the Facts published a petition \"calling on the PBS ombudsman to immediately investigate how this segment came to be aired and recommend corrective action to make sure a journalistic abomination like this never happens again\":\n\nImmediately investigate the NewsHour segment featuring climate change denier and conspiracy theorist Anthony Watts for violations of PBS standards on accuracy, integrity, and transparency, and recommend corrective action to ensure that such reporting never again occurs on PBS.\n\nThe George Soros-funded shills at Media Matters predictably joined in:\n\nLast night, PBS NewsHour turned to meteorologist and climate change contrarian Anthony Watts to \"counterbalance\" the mainstream scientific opinions presented by the program. This false balance is a disservice to PBS' viewers, made worse by the program's failure to explain Watts' connection to the Heartland Institute, an organization that receives funding from some corporations with a financial interest in confusing the public on climate science.\n\nWhile PBS mentioned that 97 percent of climate scientists agree that manmade global warming is occurring, it did not reflect this consensus by giving significant airtime to Watts' contrarian views. The segment presented Watts as the counterbalance to scientists that believe in manmade global warming -- every time a statement that reflects the scientific consensus was aired, in came Watts to cast doubt in viewers' minds. As 66 percent of Americans incorrectly think that \"there is a lot of disagreement among scientists about whether or not global warming is happening,\" news organizations need to be careful not to contribute to this confusion.\n\nThe far-left Huffington Post also weighed in:\n\nA recent report from \"PBS NewsHour\" on climate change has drawn sharp criticism from climate groups that feel it provides a false sense of debate around the facts of climate change.\n\nDespite PBS' acknowledgement that climate scientists almost unanimously concur that manmade climate change is occurring, critics charge that featuring Watts \"propagates confusion\" and obscures the distinction between a scientific consensus and a very small, but vocal, minority who has a vested interest in this confusion.\n\nAll this pressure led Michels to publish what almost reads like an apology Tuesday:\n\nAnything dealing with climate change is bound to provoke an argument. And our story on Berkeley physicist Richard Muller's recent conversion to a believer in man-made global warming, which he made in an op-ed in the New York Times, certainly stirred the pot. In addition to preparing a video story on the PBS NewsHour, I had written a blog that included extended remarks from Anthony Watts, a well-known blogger and prominent voice in the skeptic community. Watts -- a former California TV weatherman who runs a company that provides weather data to TV stations -- says he doesn't completely discount global warming, but he says that much of the data recording temperatures are flawed because the stations are in areas like urban settings which retain heat and therefore read too high.\n\nThe idea of the online post -- in part -- was to let the audience hear more about the views of a prominent voice from the community of skeptics. In the past, we have on occasion provided a more expansive view from the overwhelming majority of climate scientists who say climate change is real, an ever-growing problem and one that is getting significantly worse because of our own contribution to greenhouse gases. (In fact, my colleague Hari Sreenivasan posted links to some of that prior reporting earlier today.) We thought the online post with Watts would provide a chance for viewers to hear more about the skeptical perspective than we have done recently.\n\nThat said -- and as many of you wrote us to complain -- we should have not ONLY posted additional comments from Watts' perspective.\n\nSo Michels decided to publish numerous quotes and videos from global warming alarmists to counter Watts's position including NOAA's statement.\n\nWhat Michels and PBS seem to misunderstand is that the public practically only gets such views from America's media. It was therefore refreshing to see a segment that actually had some balance.\n\nSadly, the global warming skeptics don't want that, and PBS caved to the pressure.\n\nRegardless, kudos go out to Watts for continuing to fight the good fight. His website Watts Up With That? is a daily must-read for those looking to keep truly informed on this subject.\n\nHere's the full transcript of this segment:\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Now to the debate over the magnitude of climate change, its impact, and the human role in it.\n\nTypically, the battle plays out among prominent climate scientists and a vocal group of skeptics. But one skeptic`s recent public conversion is adding new fuel to that fire and sparking criticism from both sides.\n\n\"NewsHour\" correspondent Spencer Michels has the story.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Physicist Richard Muller and his daughter, Elizabeth, a mathematician, are not exactly household names.\n\nBut in the world of climate change, where most scientists and a much smaller group of skeptics remain bitterly divided over their assessment of what`s happening to the planet, Richard Muller has long been on the side of those who deny climate change is happening.\n\nSo, when he published an op-ed in The New York Times last month saying he was no longer a skeptic, it captured national attention and sparked angry reaction on both sides of the climate fence. Perhaps most disturbing to some of his former allies was this conclusion:\n\nRICHARD MULLER, University of California, Berkeley: In our world, we attribute the warming from 1753 to the present essentially exclusively to humans -- not mostly, but exclusively.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Even those skeptics who accept that the climate is changing attribute it to natural cycles, but Muller even claimed his study was more conclusive in that regard than any that came before.\n\nRICHARD MULLER: We really are in some sense coming out with a stronger conclusion than the prior group had come out with.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Working out of their house in Berkeley, where Muller is a physics professor at the University of California, the Mullers formed the Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project.\n\nUsing funds partly supplied by the Koch brothers, who have also funded skeptical organizations like the Heartland Institute, the Mullers had long analyzed temperature data others had collected. But, for years, they said they hadn`t trusted that data.\n\nRICHARD MULLER: I think many of the people working on this had convinced themselves that global warming was real and had lost some of their objectivity.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: But in their op-ed, the Mullers said that their latest research showed that the data from other climate change scientists was by and large correct.\n\nELIZABETH MULLER, Berkeley Earth Surface Temperature Project: We used all of the data, or essentially all of the data, five times more than any other group had done. And after having done all of that, we determined that the previous -- the previous studies on global warming had been about right. There was global warming of about one degree Celsius in the past 50 years. And that was a big surprise to us.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: The conclusion about a warming climate due to human actions matched what many other climate change believers have been saying, including William Collins, a senior scientist at Lawrence-Berkeley Laboratory. He acknowledges that natural warming and cooling periods have occurred for eons, but the warming occurring now is off rhythm.\n\nWILLIAM COLLINS, Senior Scientist, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory: What we`re seeing now is occurring much faster. Rather than happening over tens of thousands of years, we`re seeing very rapid change occurring on just the time scale of a single century.\n\nThis timeline is showing how the temperature all over the globe has changed since the beginning of the 20th century. Look at how warm California has gotten, four or five degrees hotter than our historical climate.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: And, Collins concludes, man is a big contributor.\n\nWILLIAM COLLINS: What man has been doing is enhancing the greenhouse effect by taking carbon dioxide that was formed over the last half-a- billion years and releasing that carbon dioxide, which is a greenhouse gas, back into the Earth`s atmosphere.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Yet, many of those believers were annoyed that Muller`s conversion got more attention in the media than their reports have gotten in the past. They dismissed him as being publicity-hungry and adding nothing new to the debate.\n\nClimate modeler and British Green Party member William Connolley called Muller`s study rubbish, saying they hadn`t added any knowledge to what had been done before. Skeptics were even more dismissive of Muller`s work.\n\nJudith Curry, professor of earth sciences at Georgia Tech, who suspects natural variability accounts for climate change, not human- produced CO2, said Muller`s analysis is \"way oversimplistic and not at all convincing.\"\n\nEven former ally Anthony Watts thinks Muller got it wrong. Watts works five hours from Muller in Chico, California. There, he runs a company supplying data and display systems to television weather forecasters and private individuals. He was trained as a broadcast meteorologist, though he has authored some papers with academic researchers.\n\nHis blog, Watts Up With That?, bills itself as the world`s most viewed sight on global warming and climate change. Watts believes all climate warming data, Muller`s included, is off because weather stations where temperatures are recorded have soaked up heat from their surroundings.\n\nANTHONY WATTS, Meteorologist: A brick building that`s been out in the summer sun, you stand next to it at night, you can feel the heat radiating off of it. That`s a heat sink effect. We have got more freeways, you know, more airports. We have got more buildings.\n\nYes, we have some global warming. It`s clear the temperature has gone up in the last 100 years, but what percentage of that is from carbon dioxide and what percentage of that is from the changes in the local and measurement environment?\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: He also thinks believers have a hidden agenda.\n\nANTHONY WATTS: Global warming has become essentially a business in its own right. There are whole divisions of universities that are set up to study this factor. And so there`s lots of money involved. And so I think that there`s a tendency to want to keep that going and not really look at what might be different.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: It`s a charge climate change believers say is totally false. But many do agree with Watts` criticism of Muller for presenting his report in a newspaper, rather than in a scientific journal.\n\nANTHONY WATTS: He has not succeeded in terms of how science views, you know, a successful inquiry. His papers have not passed peer review.\n\nRICHARD MULLER: In science, peer review means you give talks to the public. You send your papers to colleagues around the world. That`s what I did. Before I wrote my op-ed, we put all of our papers available on the Web.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: But the fight over climate change is anything but academic. Whether the politicians listen to the 97 percent of scientists who say that it is real or they pay attention to the vocal community of skeptics will determine to a large extent what regulations and what laws get passed.\n\nNeither presidential candidate is talking about climate change, but, in Congress, it`s a different story; 74 percent of U.S. Senate Republicans publicly question the science of global warming, including Oklahoma Senator James Inhofe, who thinks it`s a hoax.\n\nSEN. JAMES INHOFE (R), Oklahoma: Those people who really believe that world is coming to an end because of global warming, and that`s all due to manmade anthropogenic gases, we call those people alarmists.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Polls show more than half the Republicans in the House are global warming skeptics. Many were elected with the Tea Party wave during the 2010 election.\n\nIn 2011, a Republican-dominated House committee defeated an amendment offered by Democrats simply acknowledging warming of the Earth.\n\nStanford University professor of communication and political science Jon Krosnick, who has polling on climate change for 15 years, thinks the skeptics are winning in Washington.\n\nJON KROSNICK, Stanford University: The voices of skeptics on climate change are very loud in this country and particularly effective in Washington at the moment. But they`re a very, very small group.\n\nLess than 10 percent of Americans are confidently skeptical about climate change at the moment. And yet that group expresses its points of view so often and so vociferously that I believe they have got Washington confused at the moment.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: He says his polls, taken nationwide, show many Americans still worry about climate change.\n\nJON KROSNICK: From the very beginning, we were surprised that large majorities, and in some cases huge majorities of Americans, expressed what you might call green opinions on the issue. They said they thought the planet had been gradually warming over the last 100 years. They thought human activity was responsible for it. And they supported a variety of government actions because they saw it as a threat.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Krosnick says that neither storms nor the recent drought that has been affecting the Midwest affect his poll numbers, which have remained steady for more than a decade.\n\nHowever, other polls showed a significant decline in the number of Americans saying there is solid evidence global warming is occurring, a drop of 20 percent between 2008 and 2010, when belief started rising again.\n\nAnd polls conducted by Gallup and other news organizations suggest the issue ranks lower on voters` top priorities. Watts says polls can be manipulated by how the question is asked. He`s worried that those who believe in manmade climate change will have their way in Washington.\n\nANTHONY WATTS: Some of the issues have been oversold. And they have been oversold because they allow for more regulation to take place. And so the people that like more regulation use global warming as a tool as a means to an end. And so, as a result, we might be getting more regulation and more taxes that really aren`t rooted in science, but more in politics.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: But Muller and others think action is exactly what is needed.\n\nRICHARD MULLER: I expect we will have considerable warming. And I think, depending on the growth of China, between 20 years and 50 years from now, we will be experiencing weather that`s warmer than Homo sapiens ever experienced. And I tend to think that`s going to be bad and we should do something about it and we can do something about it.\n\nSPENCER MICHELS: Doing something about global warming raises a host of other issues, including new regulations and the costs of reducing greenhouse gases, issues that inflame an already contentious debate.\n\nJUDY WOODRUFF: Online, Spencer talks to climate skeptic Anthony Watts about politics and global warming.",

  "latent_26193": "New online system set to reduce hundreds of chemical tests on animals\n\nPosted on 20 June 2017\n\nScientists at the University of York and SimOmics Ltd have developed a new online data sharing system which could reduce the need for hundreds of laboratory tests on animals.\n\nSimOmics Ltd, a spin-out company of the University, claim that the new web-based system, developed for the agricultural chemical production industry, could significantly reduce the number of tests on animals by allowing chemical formulations to be shared between companies.\n\nTo ensure human safety, agricultural chemical formulations, such as pesticides, are tested on animals for acute oral, skin and eye irritation classification. For confidentiality reasons, the chemical formulations are not shared between companies, which mean that other interested companies maybe testing the same formulas, requiring yet more animal experimentation.\n\nReplace testing\n\nProfessor Jon Timmis, Head of the University’s Department of Electronic Engineering and CEO of SimOmics Ltd, said: “It is crucial that agricultural chemical products are tested for their safety before they are used in the environment.\n\n“Small animals, such as rats and rabbits, are currently used to test chemical formulations, but there is now a growing commitment across the industry to reduce the number of animals used in testing and eventually replace them altogether.\n\n“We estimate that the new system we are working on could reduce the need for tests on more than 1,000 animals a year.”\n\nConfidentiality\n\nThe SimOmics Ltd team, which includes scientists from the University’s electronic engineering, environment, mathematics, and computer science departments, have been awarded £100,000 from the National Centre for the Replacement, Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research (NC3Rs), to develop a system that will pool existing animal data together with non-animal data and mathematical models to determine acute oral, skin and eye irritation classifications whilst maintaining confidentiality of agrochemical company formulations. .\n\nSupported by the NC3Rs, and agrochemical companies Syngenta, and Dow Agrochemical scientists, the project will aim to deliver a new system to confidently classify mixtures of chemicals based on existing data. This will then present the user with options on how to locate those results without having to conduct any further testing on animals.\n\nEvidence-based\n\nProfessor Timmis said: “The reason this kind of data has not been shared before is because the ingredients of formulations are kept confidential.\n\n“Our new system will explore whether putting an evidence-based data management in place, which can be provided to a system regulator, will help facilitate the sharing of confidential data and models in an acceptable way, potentially cutting the use of animal testing in the thousands each year.”\n\nYork mathematicians and computer scientist will produce algorithms that allow the new tool to make predictions based on testing data already available. These predictions will be able to guide the need for experimentation, or promote the sharing of data that could indicate no further experiments are required.\n\nProfessor Timmis added: “Development of these kinds of technologies will help to change the mind-set of whole industries and regulators as well as promote the use of alternative testing tools and reusable data. We have seen much industry support for this research already, so we are looking forward to launching the new system within the next 12 months.”",
  "latent_26282": "President Barack Obama turns to leave the stage after he spoke about National Security Agency (NSA) surveillance, Friday, Jan. 17, 2014, at the Justice Department in Washington. (AP Photo/Charles Dharapak)\n\nOn the campaign trail in 2008, Barack Obama promised to preside over the most transparent administration in U.S. history. “No more secrecy,” he said. “That is a commitment that I make to you.”\n\nAs president, however, Obama has embraced many of the same domestic surveillance programs he once derided as a candidate. For the one-time constitutional law professor, the shift has been particularly striking. Here is a brief history:\n\n2004 — The Race for the U.S. Senate\n\nObama, campaigning for Senate, begins to address questions about the intersection of national security and privacy. He takes aim at the Patriot Act for “violating our fundamental notions of privacy,” and tells the Democratic National Convention, “We don’t like federal agents poking around our libraries.”\n\n2005 — Obama the Critic\n\nAs a senator, Obama focuses on reining in government surveillance. In 2005, he sponsors a bill to make it harder for federal agents to use a special type of subpoena, known as a national security letter, to obtain business records without a court order.\n\nThat same year, he joins Democrats to press for additional civil liberties protections in a vote to extend the Patriot Act. The law, he says, “seriously jeopardizes the rights of all Americans and the ideals America stands for.”\n\n2006 — A Vote Against Michael Hayden for the CIA\n\nObama votes against confirming Gen. Michael Hayden, who as head of the NSA under President George W. Bush, developed the administration’s highly controversial warrantless wiretapping program. Explaining his vote, Obama says:\n\nAmericans fought a revolution in part over the right to be free from unreasonable searches — to ensure that our government could not come knocking in the middle of the night for no reason. We need to find a way forward to make sure we can stop terrorists while protecting the privacy and liberty of innocent Americans.\n\n2007 — A Promise on the Road to the White House\n\nBy 2007, Obama is campaigning for the White House and making government transparency a central part of his platform. He tells an audience in Washington that the Bush administration “puts forward a false choice between the liberties we cherish and the security we provide.”\n\nAs president, Obama says, he will provide U.S. intelligence agencies the tools they need to defeat terrorists without undermining the Constitution. “That means no more illegal wiretapping of American citizens. No more national security letters to spy on citizens who are not suspected of a crime … No more ignoring the law when it is inconvenient.”\n\nJuly 2008 — A Vote for the FISA Amendments Act\n\nSeeking to enhance his national security credentials amid a close race for president, Obama votes for a law expanding the government’s ability to eavesdrop on communications inside the U.S. without obtaining a specific warrant for each case.\n\nThe measure includes a controversial provision granting legal immunity to phone companies that participated in the NSA’s wiretapping program. The vote comes just months after an Obama spokesman told Talking Points Memo, “To be clear, Barack will support a filibuster of any bill that includes retroactive immunity for telecommunications companies.”\n\n2010 — Keeping the Power to Seize Records\n\nIn an early move as president, Obama signs a one-year extension for several controversial elements of the Patriot Act. Among the provisions renewed is Section 215, which allows the government to petition the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court to compel businesses — such as Verizon — to hand over customer records.\n\n2011 — Patriot Act Is Renewed Again, with an “Autopen”\n\nThe president again renews the Patriot Act, offering a new lifeline to several controversial elements of the law, including Section 215; the use of “roving wiretaps”; and the so-called “lone-wolf” provision, which allows for surveillance of individuals with no known ties to a terrorist organization.\n\nObama is traveling in Europe as the law is set to expire, so he directs the bill be signed into law by a mechanical autopen. Administration officials say it is the first time in history that a president has used a mechanical signature to turn a bill into law.\n\n2012 — An Extension for the FISA Amendments Act\n\nObama signs a five-year extension of the FISA Amendments Act, the same law he once threatened to filibuster as a senator. The extension is approved despite a failed push in the Senate for more oversight and public disclosure. Later in the year, he tells Jon Stewart on The Daily Show (apx. 27 seconds into the video below) that the administration had “modified” Bush-era surveillance practices and put “safeguards in place that weren’t there before.”\n\nJune 5, 2013 — NSA Spying Under Obama is Exposed\n\nThe Edward Snowden revelations begin to come out. The Guardian reports that for the first time under the Obama administration, the telephone communications records for millions of Americans “are being collected indiscriminately and in bulk — regardless of whether they are suspected of any wrongdoing.” The next day, Barton Gellman and Laura Poitras report in The Washington Post that the NSA is tapping into the central servers of nine leading U.S. Internet firms, “extracting audio and video chats, photographs, e-mails, documents, and connection logs.”\n\nJune 7, 2013 — Obama Responds to the Snowden Leaks\n\nThe president makes his first public statement on the Snowden leaks, saying the telephone records program “is fully overseen not just by Congress, but by the FISA Court.” No one, he says, “is listening to the content of people’s phone calls.” Obama admits to having had “a healthy skepticism” about the surveillance programs he inherited as president, but ultimately concluded that they helped prevent terrorist attacks.\n\n“It’s important to recognize that you can’t have 100 percent security and also then have 100 percent privacy and zero inconvenience,” he says. “We’re going to have to make some choices as a society.”\n\nJan. 17, 2014 — A Call for Reform\n\nObama outlines reforms for the NSA’s telephone metadata program “as it currently exists.” Critics “are right to point out that without proper safeguards, this type of program could be used to yield more information about our private lives, and open the door to more intrusive bulk collection programs in the future,” he says.\n\nUnder the White House plan, outlined in March, the phone data would no longer stay in the hands of the NSA. Instead, phone companies would warehouse the data themselves. In order to access it, the government would first need a judge’s permission.",

For other uses, see Acrasia (disambiguation)\n\nAkrasia (; Greek ἀκρασία, \"lacking command\"), occasionally transliterated as acrasia or Anglicised as acrasy or acracy, is described as a lack of self-control or the state of acting against one's better judgment.[1] The adjectival form is \"akratic\".[2]\n\nClassical approaches [ edit ]\n\nPortrait in marble of Socrates , who was an early investigator of akrasia\n\nThe problem goes back at least as far as Plato. In Plato's Protagoras Socrates asks precisely how it is possible that, if one judges action A to be the best course of action, one would do anything other than A?\n\nIn the dialogue Protagoras, Socrates attests that akrasia does not exist, claiming \"No one goes willingly toward the bad\" (358d). If a person examines a situation and decides to act in the way he determines to be best, he will pursue this action, as the best course is also the good course, i.e. man's natural goal. An all-things-considered assessment of the situation will bring full knowledge of a decision's outcome and worth linked to well-developed principles of the good. A person, according to Socrates, never chooses to act poorly or against his better judgment; and, therefore, actions that go against what is best are simply a product of being ignorant of facts or knowledge of what is best or good.\n\nAristotle, on the other hand, took a more empirical approach to the question, acknowledging that we intuitively believe in akrasia. He distances himself from the Socratic position by locating the breakdown of reasoning in an agent’s opinion, not his appetition. Now, without recourse to appetitive desires, Aristotle reasons that akrasia occurs as a result of opinion. Opinion is formulated mentally in a way that may or may not imitate truth, while appetites are merely desires of the body. Thus, opinion is only incidentally aligned with or opposed to the good, making an akratic action the product of opinion instead of reason. For Aristotle, the antonym of akrasia is enkrateia, which means \"in power\" (over oneself).[3]\n\nThe word akrasia occurs twice in the Koine Greek New Testament. In Matthew 23:25 Jesus uses it to describe hypocritical religious leaders, translated \"self-indulgence\" in several translations, including the English Standard version. Paul the Apostle also gives the threat of temptation through akrasia as a reason for a husband and wife to not deprive each other of sex (1 Corinthians 7:5). In another passage (Rom. 7:15–25) Paul, without actually using the term akrasia, seems to reference the same psychological phenomenon in discussing the internal conflict between, on the one hand, \"the law of God,\" which he equates with \"the law of my mind\"; and \"another law in my members,\" identified with \"the flesh, the law of sin.\" \"For the good that I would do, I do not; but the evil which I would not, that I do.\" (v.19)\n\nIn Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, book II, Acrasia, the embodiment of intemperance dwelling in the \"Bower of Bliss\", had the Circe-like capacity of transforming her lovers into monstrous animal shapes.\n\nContemporary approaches [ edit ]\n\nDonald Davidson (1969–1980) attempted to solve the problem by first criticizing earlier thinkers who wanted to limit the scope of akrasia to agents who despite having reached a rational decision were somehow swerved off their \"desired\" tracks. Indeed, Davidson expands akrasia to include any judgment that is reached but not fulfilled, whether it be as a result of an opinion, a real or imagined good, or a moral belief. \"[T]he puzzle I shall discuss depends only on the attitude or belief of the agent…my subject concerns evaluative judgments, whether they are analyzed cognitively, prescriptively, or otherwise.\" Thus, he expands akrasia to include cases in which the agent seeks to fulfill desires, for example, but ends up denying himself the pleasure he has deemed most choice-worthy.\n\nDavidson sees the problem as one of reconciling the following apparently inconsistent triad:\n\nIf an agent believes A to be better than B, then they want to do A more than B.\n\nIf an agent wants to do A more than B, then they will do A rather than B if they only do one.\n\nSometimes an agent acts against their better judgment.\n\nDavidson solves the problem by saying that, when people act in this way, they temporarily believe that the worse course of action is better, because they have not made an all-things-considered judgment, but only a judgment based on a subset of possible considerations.\n\nAnother contemporary philosopher, Amélie Rorty (1980) has tackled the problem by distilling out akrasia's many forms. She contends that akrasia is manifested in different stages of the practical reasoning process. She enumerates four types of akrasia: akrasia of direction or aim, of interpretation, of irrationality, and of character. She separates the practical reasoning process into four steps, showing the breakdown that may occur between each step and how each constitutes an akratic state.\n\nAnother explanation is that there are different forms of motivation which can conflict with each other. Throughout the ages, many have identified a conflict between reason and emotion, which might make it possible to believe that one should do A rather than B, but still end up wanting to do B more than A.\n\nPsychologist George Ainslie argues that akrasia results from the empirically verified phenomenon of hyperbolic discounting, which causes us to make different judgements close to a reward than we will when further from it.[4]\n\nWeakness of will [ edit ]\n\nRichard Holton (1999), argues that weakness of the will involves revising one's resolutions too easily. Under this view, it is possible to act against one's better judgment (that is, be akratic), but without being weak-willed. Suppose, for example, Sarah judges that taking revenge upon a murderer is not the best course of action, but makes the resolution to take revenge anyway and sticks to that resolution. According to Holton, Sarah behaves akratically but does not show weakness of will.\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ \"College Info Geek\". ^ akrasia/akratic) in English texts, it was once the philosophers' English language convention to use the precise English equivalent of akrasia/akratic, incontinence/incontinent.

  "latent_26386": "By Céline Nahory\n\nThe veto has always loomed over the work of the UN Security Council. During the Cold War, the United States and the Soviet Union often brandished their prerogative publicly in Council meetings. Overall, the five permanent members cast 199 vetoes between 1946 and 1989 (1) - well over four per year - preventing the Council from taking action on many important matters. Since the end of the Cold War, however, the formal use of the veto has diminished dramatically. Between January 1990 and March 2004, the Permanent Five (P5) cast 17 vetoes - only about one per year. In spite of this new appearance of restraint, the P5 continue to pressure the Security Council through a \"hidden\" veto - the quiet threat of possible veto use. As Ambassador Curtis Ward of Jamaica put it, \"the mere presence of the threat of the veto â€¦ determines the way the Council conducts its business.\" (2)\n\nPermanent members use the hidden veto mainly in closed-door informal consultations, rather than in official open meetings. Since the late 1980s, the Council largely conducts its business in such private sessions. Away from the public and without any record of what has been said, the P5 have more freedom to pressure, threaten, and even bully other members of the Council. By giving private veto warnings before a vote takes place, the P5 can \"convince\" Council members to shift their position and still persuade the international public of their good intentions.\n\nHidden vetoes - nearly always pitting a single permanent member against the rest of the Council - have a very negative impact on the work of the Security Council. Washington's constant threat of vetoes on Security Council actions critical of Israel is a notorious example of this abuse, which generally worsens international crises. Though the Arab group has obtained monthly Security Council meetings on the situation in Israel and the Occupied Territories, the US prevents any substantive role of the Council on the matter. The constant threat has been strengthened by the actual use of the veto on draft resolutions judged either \"unfair\" or \"unconstructive\" by Washington (3). By contrast, France's threat to block a resolution authorizing war against Iraq in the spring of 2003 illustrates the very unusual case of a threatened veto with an arguably positive effect. Contrary to most threats of veto, France made its threat publicly, confident that worldwide support for its action would ultimately help other members of the Council to stand up against US pressure. But in the great majority of cases, a single member issues a veto threat against the will of a large majority of Council members, and often too against the preponderance of UN member states and international public opinion. (4)\n\nControlling the Agenda\n\nPermanent members use their hidden veto to control the Council's agenda and prevent the Council from taking up certain issues. The Council never discusses crises that a P5 member considers to be within its own exclusive sphere of interest. Chechnya, Tibet, Xinjiang, Northern Ireland, Sudan, Uganda and Colombia figure among the forgotten conflicts that the Council ignores. Even in earlier days, when the formal veto was used much more frequently, hidden vetoes kept key issues such as colonial wars and Cold War conflicts off the agenda. The Security Council never debated the Algerian war or the partitioning of India because of the hidden vetoes of France and the UK. Nor did the Council take up US involvement in Vietnam or the Soviet war in Afghanistan even though hostilities continued for almost a decade after Moscow vetoed a draft resolution in 1980.\n\nTo prevent the Council from discussing taboo issues, permanent members carefully mould the monthly program of work during intense negotiations among the rotating president and the other Council members. Though the UN Charter does not provide a right of veto on procedural matters, the P5 insist on their right to set the boundaries of what may and may not be said. The P5 argue implausibly but unshakeable that the Council makes a decision on substance (rather than a simple procedural move) when deciding what goes onto the agenda, thus making such a decision subject to a veto! (5)\n\nBlocking Action\n\nEven when items pass through P5 censorship and make the agenda, permanent members continue to use the hidden veto to further their national policy goals. Iraq, a theater of deeply divergent strategic and commercial interests among the P5, has provoked more threats of veto than any other recent issue. For more than a decade, the US and UK clashed with Russia, China, and France – freely using their hidden vetoes at every turn, not only in the Security Council, but also in the Council's sanctions committee dealing with Iraq. (6) During committee debates, the US (and sometimes also the UK) blocked approval of contracts for Iraq imports under the Oil-for-Food programme, while in the Council France and Russia blocked lesser changes of the sanctions regime, pressing for extensive revamping or lifting of the sanctions. Successive threats of veto blocked action on the damaging consequences of the sanctions, the Oil-for-Food programme, no-fly zones, arms inspections and eventually the war of 2003.\n\nThe hidden veto weakens many resolutions by removing language disapproved by P5 members. France presented a draft resolution in January 2004 on the protection of children in armed conflict. The text was based on a 2003 report by the Secretary General that provided a list of affected countries. (7) The UK and Russia strenuously opposed the inclusion of Northern Ireland and Chechnya as \"armed conflicts,\" especially because the conflicts would be subject to monitoring under the terms of the resolution. London and Moscow signaled their hidden vetoes by \"refusing to support\" the text. The UN Secretariat was then forced to make \"official corrections\" to the original report so that it referred in the sensitive cases not as \"armed conflicts\" but as \"situations of concern.\" After four months of negotiations and Secretariat collusion, Resolution 1539 was then adopted unanimously. The public, generally unaware of the dispute, welcomed the adoption of the weakened resolution.\n\nIn the Security Council's culture of formal cooperation and teamwork, the hidden veto plays a highly strategic role even among the P5 group. As the Council increasingly takes decision by consensus, permanent members consult often among themselves on important matters before going to the Council with a common arrangement. In this context, permanent members may threaten a veto as leverage to strike a deal with other members or swap their support. The United States and Russia apparently struck a deal in 1999, trading off a threat of Russian veto on Iraq in return for ''no action'' on Chechnya.\n\nEarly in their term, elected members learn the topics they cannot raise without risking a very high price. Increasingly discouraged after facing one hidden veto after another, they stay away from these topics, creating what can be considered a \"double hidden veto.\" In addition to P5 threat of veto, then, elected members' self-censorship paralyzes the work of the Council. When determined ambassadors challenge the veto system, they are quickly put in their place. Past the middle of his term in the Security Council in 1999-2000, Ambassador Peter Van Walsum of the Netherlands interjected a statement about Chechnya in a Council debate on another subject. Ambassador Sergey Lavrov of Russia immediately interrupted to object and make clear that, as a veto-wielder, he would block any further discussions on the topic. The president of the Council ruled that Van Walsum was out of order and the matter never arose again.\n\nHidden vetoes can have terrible consequences. The Security Council failed to act during the Rwandan genocide in 1994 due to the hidden vetoes of France and the US. Paris and Washington not only blocked UN action, but also used their hidden veto to weaken the definition of the crisis under international law. An independent UN report admitted that the failure of the Security Council to act led directly to the genocide. (8) The Security Council could not even pass a resolution containing the word \"genocide,\" which would have required intervention by parties to the 1951 Genocide Convention. Only after the worst months of the killing did the Security Council endorse Opération Turquoise, a deployment of French troops as a \"humanitarian\" mission under the UN flag. Yet, 800,000 people died because permanent members considered an earlier UN intervention contrary to their interests. A Human Rights Watch report scathingly said: \"The Americans were interested in saving money, the Belgians were interested in saving face, and the French were interested in saving their ally, the genocidal government.\" (9)\n\nHidden vetoes usually do not make the headlines, so the public tends to believe that the veto is a problem of the past. Permanent members continue to keep the Security Council under intense political pressure, shaping Council action according to their own national interests. Only abolishing the power of veto can resolve the problem of the hidden veto. But permanent members oppose any reforms of the voting system. Eager to keep their absolute prerogative, the P5 will rule out any attempts to eliminate the veto - even proposals aiming at limiting the use and the scope of the veto. Permanent members concede that the veto should remain a \"last resort,\" but in fact they use the hidden veto constantly. Their abusive use of this privilege bedevils the Security Council, making it undemocratic, lacking in legitimacy and often sadly ineffective.\n\nFootnotes:\n\n(1) Between 1946 and 1989, the USA and USSR cast respectively 60 and 79 vetoes. The topics vary from the Korean war and the Middle East conflict to applications for membership. Moscow especially exercised its veto power in the early period, while Washington cast its first veto in 1970.

See a complete list of subjects of the veto: security/membship/veto/vetosubj.htm\n\n(4) Because veto threats are issued informally, it is impossible to count the number of hidden vetoes, which must add up to many hundreds. As an indicator, the count of actually cast vetoes gives a sense of how the P5 use the hidden veto to block decision against the will of other Council members. Among the 216 vetoes cast between 1946 and April 2004, only 27 were cast by more than one P5 member.\n\n(5) See Bailey and Daws, The Procedure of the Security Council, Clarendon Press, Oxford, 1998, Third Edition, p. 240-249.\n\n(6) Sanctions Committees operate by consensus.

He returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution to overthrow Gadhafi.\n\nHe has criticized the government for not getting a grip on violence, particularly from Islamist groups, and has called for the government in Tripoli to be removed from power.\n\nHe has named his campaign against Islamist militias Operation Dignity.\n\nMilitants have attacked foreign diplomats, Westerners, Libyan journalists, activists and judges, but they have aimed most of their violence at government security forces with nearly daily bombings, kidnappings and assassinations.\n\nEstablishment army clout\n\nMany of those who have declared alliance with Haftar come from the ranks of Libya's army, including well-respected officers, and they have been on war footing with Islamist militias already. Members of secular militias have also joined the LNA.\n\nThe central government has vehemently objected to Haftar's offensive, but the retired officer, who fought to overthrow former dictator Moammar Gadhafi, vowed to not stop until Libya is \"purged\" of extremists groups.\n\nIt's unclear whether there was any coordination of the attacks in Tripoli and Benghazi by forces claiming loyalty to the Libyan National Army. But their common enemy is clear: Libya's Islamists.\n\nU.S. prepares evacuations\n\nAs violence spread early this week, the U.S. military doubled the number of aircraft standing by in Italy if needed to evacuate the U.S. Embassy in Tripoli.\n\nAbout 250 Marines plus seven Ospreys and three C-130 planes were in place, just in case, a Pentagon spokesman said.\n\nNo decision has been made to close the embassy, he said, but one of the lessons of the Benghazi incident that killed the U.S. ambassador and three more U.S. citizens was the \"need to be more agile.\"",

MUST WATCH Crucial 48 hours at Mar-a-Lago may hold answers 01:30\n\nPlanning for busy year ahead\n\n\"We'll be working in Florida -- I'll be working very hard during that Christmas because we have many things we're talking about, including North Korea, including a lot of things happening in the Middle East, as you know,\" Trump told reporters at the White House on Friday.\n\nThat may not be strictly true -- the President is spotted on the golf course nearly every weekend that he spends in South Florida -- but Trump has at moments converted his 90-year-old compound into the center of power for the US government, complete with strategy sessions on the patio and top-secret briefings carried out in converted anterooms.\n\nIn Florida for his first Christmas as President, Trump is expected to begin work on his State of the Union address, due to be delivered at the end of January. And he's said he'll continue weighing his next legislative priority, either welfare reform or a new infrastructure package.\n\nPeople close to him say Trump is also likely to reflect on the makeup of his team as he approaches the one-year mark of his presidency. Buoyant in his tax achievement, Trump isn't likely to demand a dramatic overhaul of his inner circle. But cognizant of impending departures of key West Wing and Cabinet staff, the President will contemplate his options.\n\nThat includes what to do with Tillerson, the beleaguered secretary of state, who has insisted that he'll remain in place even as some White House aides are working to choreograph his exit. This week's high-profile actions by US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, praised exuberantly by Trump in a cabinet meeting on Wednesday, only exacerbated the impression that she and not Tillerson is the administration's foreign policy star.\n\nTrump is also facing pressure to revamp his political operation after election defeats in Virginia, New Jersey and Alabama. A spat in the Oval Office between current and former members of his political operation highlighted the different factions pulling at the President as midterm congressional elections near.\n\nMar-a-Lago guest rules\n\nMembers still flock to Trump's club when he is in town, despite strict security measures and new rules against taking photos in the dining room when the President is around. Reservations are required two weeks in advance, and new limits have been placed on the number of guests that members are permitted to bring.\n\nThe ticket prices for New Year's Eve are also going up. Tickets are going for up to $600 for members and $750 for guests, an increase from 2016's prices of $525 for members and $575 for guests, Politico reported\n\nIn the year that Trump has been President, not everyone has viewed his private oceanfront club with new luster. More than a dozen charity groups abandoned plans to host fund-raisers at Mar-a-Lago after Trump made equivocal remarks about racial violence in Virginia.\n\nAnd Palm Beach County continues to strain at the costs required to keep Trump's facility secure while he's here. The Department of Homeland Security announced this week that it was awarding a $3.3 million grant to the Palm Beach County Sheriff's Office for costs associated with presidential protection.\n\nBut for a President who's nearly completed a chaotic year of governing, the familiar Mar-a-Lago cloisters and the wealthy snowbirds who populate them provide a reminder of when life seemed easier.\n\n\"It's my second home,\" Trump told a group of schoolchildren in March. \"I'm here all the time.\"",
  "latent_26764": "The React Native Feature No One's Talking About\n\nLast week I started digging into the internals of the React Native project. I was looking to get a better understanding of how to debug and profile React Native apps with Chrome Developer tools. What I learned was a bit surprising and showed huge potential for future app developers.\n\nHere’s a little background on how React Native works, at a high level it’s broken down into two isolated runtimes.\n\nJS Runtime (Application)\n\nThe JavaScript runtime is responsible for driving the application logic. This code is executed asynchronously over their bridging mechanism and results are sent back to the native runtime.\n\nNative Runtime (UI)\n\nThe native runtime is responsible for rendering UI efficiently and emitting events (touch, scroll, zoom etc.). The events are pushed over the bridging mechanism and the UI is updated based on the response.\n\nIn a typical configuration the JavaScript is being executed on the device (or simulator) with the local JavaScript engine. Due to the decoupled architecture of React Native the JavaScript can be executed either locally or remotely. You can activate remote execution now by using the Chrome Developer Tools. This is activated by pressing ⌘+D in the simulator and then selecting Debug In Chrome.\n\nThis triggers the JavaScript application logic to be executed remotely inside of the newly opened Chrome tab. This is useful because it allows you to use all of the profiling and debugging tools already baked into Chrome. What’s interesting is that React Native enables remotely executed JavaScript to be driving a thin native UI.\n\nThe JavaScript is platform agnostic and can be ran nearly anywhere, from a browser tab to an instance of Node running on AWS.\n\nRemote JS Runtime\n\nHere’s an overview on how this is achieved inside of a Chrome tab. Digging into React Native’s debugger.html (opened when the Debug In Chrome is selected) you can see how it’s implemented.\n\nEstablish A Connection Via Websocket\n\nFirst a connection is established between the native runtime and the remote runtime via Websocket. In the initialization process a sessionID is exchanged and the JavaScript runtime is reset to a clean state.\n\n// handler for message type `prepareJSRuntime` 'prepareJSRuntime' : function ( message ) { window . onbeforeunload = undefined ; window . localStorage . setItem ( 'sessionID' , message . id ); window . location . reload (); }\n\nLoad Application Logic\n\nThe scripts are injected into the runtime so they can be executed later.\n\n// handler for message type `executeApplicationScript` 'executeApplicationScript' : function ( message , sendReply ) { for ( var key in message . inject ) { window [ key ] = JSON . parse ( message . inject [ key ]); } loadScript ( message . url , sendReply . bind ( null , null )); } function loadScript ( src , callback ) { var script = document . createElement ( 'script' ); script . type = 'text/javascript' ; script . src = src ; script . onload = callback ; document . head . appendChild ( script ); }\n\nAsynchronously Run JavaScript Remotely\n\nAfter the JavaScript runtime has all of the scripts injected it’s ready to start running commands remotely. These commands are sent in batches and the results are reported back to the native runtime over the Websocket.\n\n// handler for message type `executeJSCall` 'executeJSCall' : function ( message , sendReply ) { var returnValue = null ; try { if ( window && window . require ) { var module = window . require ( message . moduleName ); returnValue = module [ message . moduleMethod ]. apply ( module , message . arguments ); } } finally { sendReply ( JSON . stringify ( returnValue )); } }\n\nWhen experimenting with the codebase a I updated the debugger.html page to visualize the batched JavaScript calls and show the UIs memory and CPU utilization - PR Can Be Found Here\n\nLimitations\n\nI’m sure there’s someone out there thinking you’re proposing that I run application logic behind a websocket, isn’t that slow?. Of course there’s overhead, there are multiple hops over the Websocket before you get a response from a function call. The point would not be to run everything remotely, just the bits the would get the most benefit from it.\n\nWhy is this cool?\n\nYou’re not limited to where the mobile application logic must be executed. This provides more options to build better mobile applications. From a Front End developer’s perspective the fact that the code is running remotely is completely abstracted. They simply see the response from a function call and don’t need to be concerned about where the code was executed. It’s even conceivable to be executing code on another mobile device (these features are disabled at compile time when not in debug mode for security reasons), which makes possible a whole new class of applications that were either too difficult or not previously possible.\n\nIt’s been a lot of fun playing around with the React Native codebase, and I think it shows that Facebook has invested time and energy into the project. Got to love open source.\n\nHave some thoughts on this? Reach out to me on Twitter: @hjharnis",
  "latent_26941": "According to the New Jersey Law Journal , Unilever, a company that sells mayonnaise as Best Food and Hellmann’s, is suing Hampton Creek, the makers of Just Mayo, for alleged false advertising.\n\nThe lawsuit claims that Hampton Creek is falsely advertising the plant-based mayonnaise to the public as real mayonnaise by calling it Just Mayo. Unilever has concluded that since one of the main ingredients in traditional mayonnaise is eggs, and since Just Mayo does not contain any eggs, Hampton Creek is in violation of the law.\n\nHave you ever heard of anything so ridiculous?\n\nIn addition, Unilever claims that the name Just Mayo is causing its own sales to drop and the mislabeling will only lead to more \"irreparable harm\" to the company.\n\nInstead of suing Hampton Creek for falling sales, perhaps Unilever should have a look in its own backyard.

  "latent_26982": "It includes $300 billion in temporary tax cuts for individuals and businesses, in part to attract Republican support. It includes a big expansion of safety-net programs like unemployment insurance, which Democrats say makes both economic and social sense. It includes more money for highways, schools and other public infrastructure; more money for “green” energy projects; and more money to help state governments pay for health care and education.\n\nRepublicans, as always, are advocating for more and broader tax cuts. But the evidence is ambiguous about whether tax cuts will really spur economic activity at a time when consumers and businesses alike are frozen in fear and reluctant to let go of their money.\n\nThe risk is that Mr. Obama and the Congress will weigh down their effort with measures that cost many billions of dollars but may not have much impact on economic activity.\n\nTax breaks, for example, usually produce less than $1 of stimulus for every dollar they cost, economists say. Spending on public construction projects, like highways and bridges, produces the most economic activity — but there is a limit to how many projects are “shovel-ready,” and even those take time to generate jobs and ripple through the economy.\n\nChristina Romer, whom Mr. Obama has designated to be his chief economist, concluded in research she helped write in 1994 that interest-rate policy is the most powerful force in economic recoveries and that fiscal stimulus generally acts too slowly to be of much help in pulling the economy out of recessions, though associates said she now supports a big stimulus package if policy makers roll it out early enough in the recession.\n\nThe goal behind all those ideas is to jump-start economic activity by getting as much money as possible as quickly as possible into the hands of consumers and businesses, trying to make up for the falling demand in the private sector that is leading to higher unemployment. And although the package includes a big dose of tax cuts, it represents a big departure from President Bush’s playbook by relying heavily on direct government spending.\n\n“This is not an intellectual exercise, and there’s no pride of authorship,” Mr. Obama told a news conference in Washington on Friday. “If members of Congress have good ideas, if they can identify a project for me that will create jobs in an efficient way — that does not hamper our ability to, over the long term, get control of our deficit; that is good for the economy — then I’m going to accept it.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nMr. Obama’s aides said he did not intend to unveil a detailed formal proposal but rather to allow Congress to fill in the outline that he has proposed.\n\nGiven the recent scale of the downturn — the nation lost 1.5 million jobs in the last three months of 2008, and economic output during those months shrank by 6 percent compared with same period in 2007 — economists were highly uncertain about whether the economic plan would provide enough firepower.\n\nAdam Posen, the deputy director of the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, said Mr. Obama’s plan could provide just the right boost — if it was carried out properly.\n\nBut as the Federal Reserve has been learning for months now, the biggest obstacle to economic activity right now is not a shortage of money. The real obstacle is pervasive fear, which has made banks reluctant to lend and companies reluctant to invest in expansion.\n\nAlan J. Auerbach, an economist at the University of California, Berkeley, said the overall scale of the program looked “reasonable” at $800 billion over two years.\n\n“It’s much bigger than anything that’s been tried in my lifetime, but this is scarier than anything we’ve seen in my lifetime,” Professor Auerbach said.\n\nLeft to their own devices, many Congressional Democrats would prefer to focus almost entirely on spending projects and avoid tax incentives.\n\n“One thing we learned from the Depression is marginal, incentive changes don’t work very well when the economy is falling away from you very rapidly,” said Senator Kent Conrad, Democrat of North Dakota and chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. “And that’s what’s occurring here.”\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nBut Republicans have been adamant about the need for tax breaks, and Mr. Obama has made it clear he would like to bring as many members on board as possible.\n\nRepresentative Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, said in an interview, “I really do believe that if you combine the evidence of history along with the psychological concerns about making investments in the economy today, the better bang for your buck is lower taxes that are certain and permanent and lasting.”\n\nThe Democratic plan would direct much of the stimulus money to low-income and middle-income families. That reflects both traditional Democratic concerns about helping lower-income households, as well as the view of economists who say that people with lower incomes are more likely to spend rather than save any money they receive from the government.\n\nMark M. Zandi, chief economist at Moody’s Economy.com, a forecasting firm, told a forum of House Democrats this week that the “bang for the buck” — the additional economic activity generated by each dollar of fiscal stimulus — was highest for increases in food and unemployment benefits. Each dollar of additional money for food stamps yields $1.73 in additional economic activity, Mr. Zandi estimated, and each extra dollar in unemployment benefits yields about $1.63.\n\nBy contrast, Mr. Zandi estimated, most tax cuts produce less than a dollar for each dollar of stimulus, especially if the tax cuts are temporary, because people save at least some of their extra money.\n\nOne of the few tax cuts that economists say can generate a positive bang for the buck is a reduction in payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare.\n\nMr. Obama wants to offer a tax credit of $500 for individuals, and up to $1,000 for families, which they would receive through a temporary reduction in payroll tax withholdings. The idea, known as the Making Work Pay credit, was part of Mr. Obama’s economic platform during the presidential campaign. As originally envisioned, it would have been available to households with annual incomes as high as $200,000.\n\nBut economists said the tax credit could have drawbacks as an economic stimulus measure, mainly because people usually save part of the money or use it to pay down debt. That makes good sense from an individual’s standpoint but does nothing to increase economic activity.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nJoel Slemrod, a professor of tax policy at the University of Michigan, said, “The research I’ve done on the 2001 and 2008 tax rebates suggests that the proportion of the rebates that went to spending was rather small, about one-third.”\n\nAfter Congress approved Mr. Bush’s tax rebate to individuals and families last spring, economic activity jumped fleetingly during the summer, and then stalled out again in the fall.\n\nSome Democratic officials were also skeptical.\n\n“It’s not that rebates don’t work under normal conditions,” said one senior Democratic aide in the Senate. “It’s that current conditions are not normal and are not favorable to rebates or broad tax relief.”",

  "latent_27493": "\"Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans.\"\n\nCan the Republican establishment steer GOP voters away from Donald Trump? Pundits on CNN chewed over the matter recently, with one conservative arguing they shouldn’t try.\n\n\"I think we're missing one important point here. Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,\" said Mike Rogers , a former Republican congressman from Michigan and CNN's national security commentator, on Jan. 12.\n\nRogers said people who don't see this are \"missing the folks on the street who are drawn to his campaign. He's got this whole group of Democrats for Trump, it's an economic issue. … This is a Republican Party attracting Democrats, independents, Reagan Democrats to a message that says this town is broken. The institutions of government are broken. The economy is broken.\"\n\nWe were intrigued by the idea that Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans, so we asked Rogers' office for his sources. We also checked some national polls.\n\nFirst stop: the latest Fox News Poll, jointly conducted by a Democratic and Republican polling firm from Jan. 4 to 7. The results were reported four days before Rogers' statement. It surveyed 1,006 registered voters by phone and found that in a matchup with Hillary Clinton, Trump's level of support was 84 percent among Republican but only 9 percent among Democrats.\n\nThe latest Quinnipiac poll to look at the question, conducted Dec. 16-20 among 1,140 registered voters, found that while 82 percent of Republicans would support Trump, only 4 percent of Democrats would vote for him in a matchup with Clinton.\n\nSo Democratic support for Trump doesn't come close to his level seen among Republican voters.\n\nWhen we asked Rogers about his sources, his spokeswoman sent us two articles, one from the New York Times and the other an opinion piece from U.S. News & World Report .\n\nThe Times analysis is based on surveys by Civis Analytics of more than 11,000 people who say they lean Republican. Trump's support was 43 percent among Republicans who are still registered as Democrats. But that group makes up only 8 percent of the respondents who said they tend to support the GOP, and Civis spokeswoman Lisa Kornblatt told us no Democrats were included in the survey.\n\nArguing that Civis polling shows that Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans \"is a misrepresentation of our data,\" she said.\n\nThe results from Mercury Analytics , cited in the U.S. News & World Report opinion piece, found that a hefty 19 percent of likely Democratic voters would cross party lines and vote for Trump if the election were held when the online survey was conducted, January 6-8.\n\nBut, in contrast, Trump was supported by 73 percent of Republicans, making him nearly four times more popular among Republicans.\n\n\"If the claim was truly 'Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans,' this is completely untrue – ridiculous,\" Mercury CEO Ron Howard wrote in an email.\n\nThe Mercury poll also found that 14 percent of likely Republican voters said they would vote for Democrat Hillary Clinton.\n\nOur ruling\n\nCNN commentator and former congressman Mike Rogers said, \"Donald Trump is appealing as much to Democrats as he is to Republicans.\"\n\nA January 2016 Fox News poll found Trump was nine times more popular among Republicans than Democrats, when matched up against Clinton. A December 2015 Quinnipiac poll found that the billionaire was 20 times more popular.\n\nRogers, in contrast, cited one survey that didn't even poll people who said they leaned Democrat and another that found Democrat support for Trump was only about one quarter of what it was among Republicans.\n\nThe relevant numbers render Roger's assertion ridiculous.",
  "latent_27554": "Preview | Recap | Notebook\n\nBobcats-Pistons Preview\n\nBy TAYLOR BECHTOLD\n\nPosted Dec 19 2013 2:28PM While the Detroit Pistons have been the league's top scoring team in the paint, they'll become even more dangerous if Brandon Jennings can continue making shots from the perimeter. Executing that plan could be tough against one of the NBA's top defensive clubs. Though they've played well on the road, the Pistons try for only their fifth win in their last 13 home games Friday night while the Charlotte Bobcats seek a season-high third straight win. Greg Monroe and Andre Drummond present a difficult matchup inside, and they teamed for 26 points and 24 rebounds as Detroit scored 52 in the paint en route to a 107-106 victory at Boston on Wednesday. The Pistons (13-14), averaging a league-high 51.6 paint points, rallied from a 21-point first-half deficit to win for the seventh time in 11 games. Led by Jennings' five 3-pointers, Detroit, which came in shooting just 31.2 percent from long range, complemented its interior production by going 10 for 27 from beyond the arc. Jennings finished with 28 points and matched a season high with 14 assists. \"He made plays,\" said coach Maurice Cheeks, whose club won at Indiana in its previous contest. \"If it wasn't for him, he made it for other players like Monroe and had plays down low.\" Jennings has averaged 20.8 points while hitting 20 of 49 from beyond the arc over his last eight contests. Monroe and Drummond combined for 27 points and 15 boards to help the Pistons hold a 58-28 advantage in the paint on the way to a 113-93 victory in the most recent matchup with the Bobcats in Detroit on April 12. Things aren't likely to come as easy against this Charlotte team, which ranks near the top of the NBA by allowing averages of 35.7 paint points and 92.7 points overall. Charlotte has limited its opponents to 10-of-41 shooting from 3-point range in its last two, but also has given up 88 paint points in wins over Sacramento and Toronto. After missing two free throws in the final 20 seconds of overtime, Kemba Walker made amends by sinking a jumper as time expired to give the Bobcats a 104-102 road win over the Raptors on Wednesday. Walker finished with 29 points and Al Jefferson added 24 and 11 rebounds for the Bobcats, who haven't won three straight since the end of last season. \"Kemba, he lives for those shots,\" Jefferson said. \"I really think he missed those free throws on purpose so we could be in that situation, because that's what he lives for.\" Walker has scored 25.7 per game on 61.4 percent shooting - including 10 for 19 from 3-point range - over his last three games. Now he'll try for his fifth straight 20-point effort against the Pistons. Despite Walker's scoring surge, Charlotte ranks near the bottom of the league with 91.1 points per game while sitting last with a 30.6 3-point percentage. The Pistons are hoping to carry over some of their road success to the home court. They've given up an average of 97.1 points during a 6-1 road stretch, but have allowed 106.6 while dropping five of seven at home. Dating back to his time with Atlanta, Detroit's Josh Smith has averaged 20.9 points on 56.2 percent shooting in eight straight wins against Charlotte.\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

(AP) Al Jefferson found a groove just in time for the Charlotte Bobcats. Jefferson scored 15 of his 24 points in the fourth quarter, and the Bobcats overtook the Detroit Pistons for a 116-106 victory Friday night. Charlotte trailed by 20 in the second quarter and by 14 heading into the fourth. \"I don't know what was going on in the first half,\" Jefferson said. \"It just got to a point where I'd had enough. I just had to go out there and do what I can do.\" Kemba Walker scored 34 points for Charlotte and Gerald Henderson added 22, but the fourth quarter belonged to Jefferson. With Detroit up 99-94, the 6-foot-10 center scored six straight points for the game's first and only lead change. Then Walker added a 3-pointer from in front of the Detroit bench to make it 103-99. Jefferson scored Charlotte's next seven points on a jumper, a three-point play and a 20-footer that made it 110-102. Brandon Jennings had 26 points for Detroit, which rallied from a 21-point deficit to beat Boston on Wednesday but blew a big lead two nights later. \"When Al gets into that kind of rhythm, with his offensive game, I'm not sure anyone is going to stop him,\" Pistons coach Maurice Cheeks said. \"We really struggled with their dribble penetration. That had been getting better, but they were able to get their guards to the basket too easily. After that, they just started going to Jefferson in the post and steamrolled us.\" Down 89-75, the Bobcats scored the first nine points of the fourth quarter to get back in the game. Charlotte ended up with 72 points in the second half and outscored the Pistons 41-17 in the final quarter. The Pistons lost despite shooting 12 of 23 from 3-point range. Charlotte won even though forward Jeff Taylor played less than a minute before going down with a right Achilles injury. Taylor left the game after only 37 seconds. He stayed down for a while after the injury to his right leg and could be heard groaning in pain before he was eventually helped off the court. Taylor is expected to undergo further testing Saturday. The Bobcats have won three straight. Jefferson equaled a season high in scoring that he'd set in an overtime win over Toronto on Wednesday. \"He played great tonight,\" Charlotte's Cody Zeller said. \"He made some tough shots and carried us in the fourth quarter. He was able to play his game tonight and got good looks down in the post.\" Josh Smith scored 18 points for Detroit, and Josh Harrellson scored all 12 of his in the second quarter. The 6-foot-10 Harrellson looked like he was auditioning for a blooper video when he missed three straight layups during one sequence in the final minute of the first quarter. Those ended up being his only misses of the first half. Kyle Singler and Chauncey Billups made 3-pointers to start the second quarter, giving the Pistons a 37-22 lead. Harrellson added a 16-footer moments later, the first of five consecutive shots he would make in the quarter, including two 3-pointers. Detroit led 52-32 after an alley-oop from Will Bynum to Andre Drummond, but there was enough time for the Bobcats not only to win - but in convincing fashion. \"It's real big, especially for a team like us, trying to prove ourselves,\" Jefferson said. \"We came back from 20 points down and we just kept fighting, and stayed together.\" NOTES: Detroit G Rodney Stuckey (sore right shoulder) did not play. ... The Bobcats are still without F Michael Kidd-Gilchrist (broken left hand). ... Charlotte went 25 of 28 on free throws. ... The last team to rally from at least 20 points behind for a victory - then blow a lead of at least 20 for a loss in the next game was Orlando in 2001, according to STATS. The Magic came back from a 20-point deficit to beat Chicago on Jan. 15, 2001, then blew a 22-point lead in a loss to Dallas three days later.\n\nCopyright 2013 by STATS LLC and Associated Press.

The therapist had taught him some self-talk techniques to get through the panic, but it wasn’t until Mark had been out of therapy for several years that he was able to make the connection between his panic attacks and the breakup with his first serious girlfriend.

It wasn’t that Mark had plans to act on any of the thoughts, or that he had ever actually taken revenge against anyone in his whole life. And certainly Mark had never been violent towards anyone either. It was just that the thoughts were so intense and so constant that Mark had seriously started to worry that maybe at heart he was capable of doing things he had never imagined himself capable of doing. And that was so scary that he couldn’t sleep much at night at all.\n\nTherapist #2 had helped Mark learn some relaxation techniques to help him with his sleep, as well as a technique called “thought stopping” in which he would snap a rubber band against his wrist each time the thoughts came and would then try to make himself think of something else instead. The rubber band snapping made his wrist kind of sore but the technique did work, at least some of the time. Mark and his therapist also talked about the difference between thinking things and acting on them, and Mark would try to remind himself that he wasn’t actually acting on the thoughts of revenge, and that it was okay to think them in his head; sometimes this helped and sometimes it didn’t.\n\nSomehow Mark and his second therapist didn’t manage to get to make the connection, though, about the similarity between Mark’s boss and his critical father, who had never given Mark the approval that he had always wanted, no matter how hard Mark tried or what he accomplished. Perhaps it would have helped to have made that connection in therapy, perhaps not. Certainly Mark did not know the difference between one type of therapy and another in any case.\n\nAnd so when Mark first came to see me and brought up the car issue at hand, it only made sense that he expected me to teach him ways to calm his anxiety down and to manage the obsessive thoughts he kept having about whether he should buy the Corvette or not.\n\nIt was hard for me to imagine why the decision about the car was keeping Mark up at night and taking over his mind to the point of his not being able to concentrate at work. Mark explained that his wife had gone over the pros and cons with him several times, and that the logical conclusion was readily apparent: Mark should buy the car. After all, there was more than enough money in the bank; Mark worked very hard for his money, and was certainly entitled to get himself a luxury car; it was undebatably time for a new car; Mark’s wife wanted him to be happy and to drive his dream car once and for all; and Mark had wanted this car for a really long time.\n\nAnd so it really made no sense that Mark somehow just couldn’t let himself get the car he really wanted.\n\nAnd that Mark couldn’t sleep at night because of his indecisiveness about the matter.\n\nAnd that Mark and his wife had almost had a fight because he was so testy about the car decision.\n\nAnd that Mark couldn’t focus at work because he was too busy trying to decide if he should get the car or not.\n\nAnd so by the time Mark got to me, he was pretty desperate. He actually told me that he felt “sort of crazy” about the whole thing.\n\n“Like I know it doesn’t make any sense,” Mark said to me, “and I’m embarrassed because my wife is going to finally see that I have a screw loose in me. Because I really can’t just turn the worry and obsessiveness off, and I know it makes no sense, and I need to buy the car already, but I just can’t decide which car to get, the cheaper one or the Corvette that I’ve always wanted. And I just can’t stop going back and forth about it no matter how hard I try.”\n\nI asked Mark what it would be like to give himself what he wanted.\n\n“It’s not that I can’t let myself have the things I want,” Mark explained to me, sort of dismissing the question, “It’s just that I’m not the kind of person who drives a…Corvette.” And he said the word Corvette as if it was practically a dirty word.\n\n“Oh.” I said. “What kind of person is the kind to drive a Corvette?”\n\nMark blushed.\n\n“Well, I guess like someone really wealthy, someone who has money to spare, some fancy business man who makes it big and can afford to drive a fancy luxury car.”\n\n“Go on,” I said.\n\n“You know,” Mark continued, as if the psychological qualities of a Corvette driver should be perfectly obvious to a therapist like myself, “people who are snobby and make everyone around feel small and insignificant. People who are successful and like to show it off to the world.”\n\n“I see,” I said this time. “And so you’re not the Corvette driving type? You’re not rich, super successful, show-offy, and able to afford a luxury car?” I asked.\n\nBut Mark never did answer my question. Instead he informed me that his anxiety had suddenly spiked so much that he felt like he was leaving his body.\n\n“Something I said just now put you into a panic?” I asked Mark innocently, despite my hunch about what was going on.\n\nMark simply said that he could feel himself back in his body now but he had a terrible headache. It was the kind of headache he got sometimes, one that seemed to come out of nowhere but was so sharp and painful that he had to just go home and go to sleep when it came on. “We can talk about this all next time,” Mark said to me, as he proceeded to pick himself up and walk right out of the session.\n\nBut by the time “next time” came, Mark had completely forgotten about what we had talked about in our last conversation.\n\n“How’s it going with the car decision?” I asked.\n\n“Well, I stopped thinking about it as much, but when I was on my way here today, the panic started all over again. I was even thinking over the week that I was going to just buy the Corvette and try not to think too much into it, but as soon as I was on my here for our session, I started feeling like there was no way I could actually go ahead with my decision.”\n\n“We were talking about Corvette drivers last session.” I reminded Mark gently. “About how they are rich, successful business men who like to show off their success.”\n\nI paused for a moment for impact.\n\n“Is this you?” I asked Mark.\n\nMark blushed again. He seemed embarrassed and looked down at the floor.\n\n“It’s just that I always knew I wanted to make it big in business,” Mark explained to me, still looking down. “I saw how hard my dad worked at his job in a factory, and how hard it was for my parents to make ends meet. I was always sort of embarrassed because my friends had dads who were really successful, and we were just always the poor ones on the block. And I had always vowed to myself that things would be different for me when I grew up, that I was going to make it big and that my own family would never have to feel the sting of that shame I always felt about my family. And I guess I am pretty successful.” Mark looked away again as the word successful rolled off his tongue.\n\n“You mean, successful as in a really wealthy businessman who can afford to drive a fancy luxury car like a Corvette and who can finally show the world that he’s not some poor, embarrassing working-class guy like his dad?” I asked.\n\nMark was still looking down, but I decided to go for the jugular anyway. “How much money do you actually make anyway?” I asked, catching Mark off guard by the directness of my approach.\n\nMark answered my question not with words, but by immediately getting one of those splitting headaches that always made him feel the need to immediately end his session so he could make his way straight home.\n\n“Do you think there might be some connection between your headaches and the idea of us talking out loud about the fact that perhaps you make quite a bit of money?” I asked Mark when he came in for our next session.\n\nThis time Mark smiled a bit sheepishly, still looking slightly embarrassed but nonetheless able to make a little eye contact with me at least for the moment.\n\nWe were definitely making some progress.\n\n“Well, I decided to buy the Corvette.” Mark informed me. “I feel kind of good about it actually, although I was still anxious about coming here and talking about it.”\n\n“So, in today’s session, are you going to show off to me and actually tell me how much money you make?” I asked Mark again, a bit of banter in my tone.\n\nMark smiled in that sheepish way again.\n\nBut this time he did manage to stay in the session at least, without getting one of those notorious headaches that I had come to expect after asking such questions.\n\nMark paused for a few moments, not quite looking down at the floor but still looking just enough to the side to avoid meeting my gaze directly.\n\n“It’s just hard to admit that I’m a…billionaire.” Mark looked down again as he said the word, but he did manage to say the word out loud.\n\nMark tried to hide the tears that were welling up in his green eyes, but they were not quite lost on me.\n\n“And I guess it’s okay for a billionaire to drive a Corvette if he really wants to.” Mark finally said, after a minute or two.\n\n“It’s just that I don’t like to admit that I make that much money,” he continued, finally putting his fears into words. “I don’t want my family to envy me, and I feel guilty that I have it so much easier than my father ever had it. And sometimes I guess I feel bad that I was so embarrassed of my dad, because he really did work so hard and he gave me a good work ethic.”\n\n“And it sounds like you also stereotype people who are financially successful quite a bit,” I added, “and that there has been something so threatening about the idea of stepping into your billionaire shoes and coming out of the closet about your success, that you felt your whole sense of self and tie to your family to be at risk.”\n\nMark nodded, and then looked at me with an assertiveness I had not seen in him before.\n\n“You do realize,” he said to me, “that this was the first time I’ve ever admitted to anyone, myself included, that I am a billionaire?”\n\n“Well, so how does it feel?” I asked Mark with a smile.\n\n“Pretty nice.” Mark said, a big smile beginning to spread all the way across his face. “Pretty nice.”",

  "latent_27666": "Councillor Giorgio Mammoliti, known for his intentionally outrageous statements, baselessly suggested Monday that Councillor Gord Perks is aiding pedophiles — and called Parkdale, which Perks represents, a “pedophile district.” Mammoliti’s words were bewildering even to another outspoken right-winger, Councillor Doug Ford, who said Mammoliti has “lost his mind.” Perks said diverse, accepting Parkdale is “a model for how the rest of Toronto should be.”\n\nCouncillor Giorgio Mammoliti stunned fellow councillors with his remarks about Parkdale and insinuations about fellow councillor Gord Perks in the context of a debate about resuming all-ages dance parties at Exhibition Place. ( BERNARD WEIL / TORONTO STAR )\n\n“In this job, sometimes people make personal attacks,” Perks said. “That’s water off my back. What really bothers me, though, is that probably one of the very best places to live anywhere in the world, and that’s Parkdale, got attacked. That I won’t tolerate.” Mammoliti made the comments in a news release on the subject of all-ages electronic dance music parties at Exhibition Place. Mammoliti persuaded the Ex board to ban the events in April, but Perks helped convince city council to reverse the ban in May. Perks argued that pushing the gatherings off of city property, where they are tightly regulated, would have only made participants less safe. Mammoliti suggested, without any evidence, that Perks has a darker motive.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“The question needs to be posed to the Parkdale representative, Councillor Gord Perks, who has publically (sic) condoned the all ages promoters — why are you advocating for children and adults to be partying together right next door to your ward which has one of the largest concentrations of registered sex offenders in the city? Who are you really representing? This is about much more than a dance party,” he said in the release. Mammoliti also said: “With ‘all-ages’ parties being held next to a pedophile district we are simply encouraging the continued abuse of our children.” He stood behind his remarks at a public consultation meeting held on the Exhibition Place grounds Monday evening. “I think that everybody in this city should be worried about the amount of people who have settled in and around this community who are sex offenders,” he said. “I won’t apologize for my particular concern around this and I will continue pointing to it as long as I am a politician.” Mammoliti told the Star that the data shows he has 15 registered sex offenders in his ward and that his office is currently trying to identify those individuals.\n\n“We’re looking them down now and we’ll find out where they live and I’ll decide what I need to do when I find out where those 15 live,” he said. The ban was initially pushed by Zlatko Starkovski, owner of Muzik nightclub, which also operates on the Exhibition grounds. In his April comments to the board, Starkovski himself suggested that all-ages events are a beacon for pedophiles.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n“I don’t pretend to represent pedophiles. I don’t want anything to do with them and quite frankly I don’t think they should exist in society, and if that means death then that’s fine with me,” said Mammoliti. One community member spoke at the meeting — Chloe-Marie Brown, a policy developer with the Toronto Youth Cabinet, who was in favour of the electronic dance events continuing. “We’re moving forward with the Music City initiative, and to deprive the city of such a cultural space, it’s a disservice to the youth,” said Brown. Data obtained by Global News shows that low-income Parkdale is home to a relatively high percentage of sex offenders — but still fewer than 100 residents out of tens of thousands. Neither Mammoliti (Ward 7, York West) nor Starkovski has presented any evidence for the assertion that these offenders have targeted the attendees of electronic dance music events. “For someone to accuse a whole district of being pedophiles, I think the guy’s lost his mind, Mammoliti, some days,” said Ford. “I may not (agree) with Councillor Perks, but I’ll support him 100 per cent on this.” Mammoliti and the left-wing Perks (Ward 14, Parkdale-High Park) had a chin-to-chin clash at a council meeting in 2012. Mammoliti memorably told a radio host that, had Perks made physical contact, he would have “kicked him in the nuts and the face at the same time.” The Exhibition Place board of governors is scheduled to meet June 25 with the future of electronic dance music parties on the agenda.

The other a quiet, unassuming, and many would say underrated tireless midfielder, beginning to make a name for himself in the domestic.\n\n“El Cabezon” César Marcelo Meli is however a name that is beginning to hit the headlines. And with a triple header of fiery Superclásico’s against arch-rivals River Plate around the corner, Boca Juniors’ very own little-big head could well prove pivotal to their long overdue success.\n\nThe summer of 2014 saw a multitude of arrivals at La Bombonera. Boca keen to revert a baron recent period, recruited heavily. Among the many was Cesar Meli (20 June 1992, Salto Argentina) perhaps only notable among the plethora of stars due to the protracted nature of his transfer.\n\nMeli’s first club Club Atlético Colón where keen to retain their promising, young midfielder. In the same way that Los Xeneizes where eager to recruit a player who already at that time had shown considerable promise in his early outings. The stalemate finally broken by the inclusion of the loan to El Sabalero of another promising youngster (who has since returned from his apprenticeship) Cristian Pavón, and thus Boca had their man.\n\nJust over 12 months on, and perhaps to the surprise of many Cesar Meli has established himself as a key component in an all-star Boca Juniors XI. Having been progressively introduced into the side under Carlos Bianchi, the arrival of his successor Rodolfo “El Vasco” Arruabarrena midway through last seasons campaign, saw the beginning of a progressive evolution both in status, and on the field contribution for the now established Boca midfielder.\n\nMost comfortable playing the “Number 8” box-to-box midfielder position, Meli’s dynamic, all action style has seen him the embrace the “third man running” role and make it his own. Indeed the Torneo 2015 has seen Cesar Meli add goals to a game that already included an insatiable work rate, and an ultra competitive, tough tackling attitude.\n\nAnd with Boca Juniors heading into the Superclásico series without two of their most dependable holding midfielders Cristian “Pichi” Erbes and Adrián Cubas. Not only will Meli’s work-rate undoubtedly increase, but so hill will his importance to any potential Boca success over rivals River Plate.\n\nSo when everybody else is focusing on the “star names” the likes of Dani Osvaldo, Teó Gutiérrez, Nico Lodeiro, Rodrigo Mora and Co.

  "latent_27730": "Controversy has grown over a last-minute addition to Republicans’ tax bill that gives real estate owners like President Donald Trump — and perhaps Sen. Bob Corker (R-TN), who suddenly came around to supporting the bill on Friday — a major tax break.\n\nThe provision essentially extends a new tax break for “pass-through” businesses, like partnerships and LLCs, to real estate investors — personally benefiting some lawmakers and exacerbating the already favorable rates for the wealthy in the bill.\n\nSeveral news reports raised questions about Corker’s sudden support for the tax bill over the weekend, pointing out that the Tennessee Republican owns a lot of commercial real estate and would likely benefit personally from the tax break. Majority Whip Sen. John Cornyn only heightened the skepticism after saying the provision was added in an effort to “cobble together the votes we needed to get this bill passed.”\n\nBut while the provision quickly became dubbed the “Corker kickback,” Corker has vehemently denied it was what won him over, saying he didn’t read the whole bill before offering his support and that he didn’t know about the provision’s existence. Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-UT), the chair of the tax-writing Finance Committee, also insists Corker had no role in the provision’s crafting.\n\nHatch wrote a letter to Corker on Monday reasserting that the alleged connection between the added provision and Corker’s support was “categorically false”:\n\nIt takes a great deal of imagination — and likely no small amount of partisanship — to argue that a provision that has been public for over a month, debated on the floor of the House of Representatives, included in a House-passed bill, and identified by JCT as an issue requiring a compromise between conferees is somehow a covert and last-minute addition to the conference report.\n\nThe provision’s intention is not entirely new: Republicans, as Hatch said, have made pass-through businesses a priority in every iteration of their tax bills. But the provision in the final draft of the tax bill, which Republicans say reconciles the differences between the House and Senate tax proposals, is a completely new way to address the entities.\n\nThe final proposal is yet another articulation of how the Republican tax bill primarily benefits America’s highest earners. The provision would amount to a multimillion-dollar windfall for wealthy real estate developers — like Trump and his son-in-law Jared Kushner.\n\nWhat does this provision actually do?\n\nFrom the beginning, Republicans have made it a priority to give pass-through businesses a tax cut.\n\nCurrently, owners of pass-through companies, like LLCs, partnerships, sole proprietorships, and S corporations — the Trump Organization, for example — are taxed as personal income, at the top individual tax rate of 39.6 percent.\n\nThe House and Senate approached pass-throughs wildly differently. The House bill gave pass-through businesses a reduced rate at 25 percent, while the Senate bill allowed them to deduct 23 percent from their taxes, in addition to lowering the top tax rate from 39.5 percent to 38.5 percent. The final tax bill reconciled between the House and Senate lowers the top rate to 37 percent and offers pass-through businesses a 20 percent tax deduction.\n\nBut there is a major point of contention in this effort.\n\nRepublicans are billing this tax break as being a benefit for small businesses, which often organize as pass-throughs instead of as corporations, which are taxed at a different rate. But the push has long received criticism as a major loophole for the wealthy, who can establish themselves as a pass-through business to pay the lower rate for their personal investments.\n\nThe Senate attempted to address these criticisms by putting up certain guardrails to prevent wealthy individuals who don’t pay wages, or create jobs, from benefiting from the lowered tax rate. It limited how much business income was eligible for the tax break to 50 percent of the wages paid by the business. In other words, it attempted to reward pass-throughs that created jobs.\n\nBut that effort was ultimately weakened in the conference report. The new provision that has caught everyone’s eye as a handout to people like Trump essentially reintroduces a tax break for wealthy investors who aren’t creating jobs — a kickback that would primarily benefit real estate investors.\n\nThis tax bill personally benefits Donald Trump\n\nTrump and his administration keep insisting that he would not benefit from this tax bill.\n\n“This is going to cost me a fortune, this thing,” Trump said at a rally in Missouri early on in the tax effort. “Believe me.”\n\nThe president has repeatedly said the “rich will not be gaining at all” with the tax bill — which Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin repeated over the weekend.\n\nThat’s not true. In fact, Trump will personally gain from this tax bill.\n\nThe Trump Organization is a pass-through; it is a large holding company for all of the golf courses and hotels that Trump owns, and it pulls in about $9.5 billion in annual revenue. But because it is exempt from the corporate income tax, and its profits are instead taxed upon distribution to shareholders, this new tax break for pass-throughs is a huge win for the Trump family — and the many other businesspeople who structure their companies like this.\n\nAs Dylan Matthews explained, there are some provisions in the proposal meant to prevent rich individuals from using this tax break as a way to shelter income, but they only limit the benefit in many cases.\n\n“The overwhelmingly rich owners of these companies will still come out way ahead,” he writes.",
  "latent_27759": "Shortly after Prozac became the best-selling drug in the world in the early 1990s, I proposed that there was little or no evidence for efficacy, but considerable evidence that the drug would worsen depression and cause severe behavioral abnormalities. I attributed much of the problem to \"compensatory changes\" in neurotransmitters as the brain resists the drug effect. Since then, in a series of books and articles , I've documented antidepressant-induced clinical worsening and some of its underlying physical causes. Now the idea has gained ground in the broader research community and has recently been named \"tardive dysphoria.\"\n\nA recent scientific study by El-Mallakh and his colleagues reviewed the antidepressant literature and concluded that any initial improvements are often followed by treatment resistance and worsening depression. They compare this problem to tardive dyskinesia, caused by antipsychotic drugs, and call it tardive dysphoria, \"an active process in which a depressive picture is caused by continued administration of the antidepressant.\" Based on rat studies, they hypothesize that \"dendrite arborization\" -- an increased branching growth of nerve cells -- caused by chronic antidepressant exposure, may be the cause.\n\nIn a meta-analysis of 46 studies, Andrews et al. (2011) found the relapse rate for antidepressant-treated patients (44.6 percent) was much higher than for placebo-treated patients (24.7 percent). Andrews also found that the more potent antidepressants caused an increased risk of relapse on drug discontinuation. A 2010 Minnesota evaluation of patient care in the state found that only 4.5 percent of more than 20,000 patients were in remission at 12 months, indicating that they had become chronically afflicted with depression during and probably as a result of their treatment.",
  "latent_28028": "Some of you may have read about and seen the video/screenshot of a mysterious worker who appeared in TEPCO's Livecam of Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant.\n\nWell, he's gone semi-public with his email to a high ranking administration official on September 8, protesting the harsh working conditions for the workers, and he has posted his statement and photographs inside the plant on his website:\n\nhttp://pointatfuku1cam.nobody.jp/e.html\n\nScroll down for his English explanation. It's not the perfect English but you get the gist. (Well, actually it is rather hard to follow, compared to the original Japanese which is relatively clear.)\n\nOne of the photos he has: A cute poster warning against the danger of heat exhaustion... \"Don't get too hot\", the girl says.\n\nThe intention of pointing toward Tepco, the goverment and the claim for them\n\nI claim the concrete improvement of the state of working conditions, entrustment of businesses to subcontract companies, ascertainment of all workers’ employment situations.\n\nAs you know according by the reports from some media, there are some workers who have some compelling reason were arranged by the people in the outlaw territory. And they work while hiding from the prime contractor that they are in unfair or harsh conditions.\n\nEven the case of the company recruiting through the Hello Work (Japanese government employment agency), the prime contractor don’t know some workers’ actual employer.\n\nToo many subcontracts cause some problems of the workers’ low wages or not to join the insurances, no contract documents, as known by reports of media.\n\nIn addition, I show some of my experiences.\n\nI had some days that I can’t asleep well in the daytime though I had works in late night because the working hours of our room’s members are inconsistent.\n\nThere is a rule that the workers have to declare the day’s conditions of their health by writing and submitting the paper. I wrote 4 about the sleeping hours honesty, but a senior rewrite as 6 while I took my eyes off. I think he judged that the existence of a person who can’t control his health is not good for our company.\n\nAnd, I saw workers who have much extra jobs except the job which the prime contractor knows. They worked so hard for miscellaneous jobs –for example, caring newcomers’ procedures– and they did their original jobs and drove a car in spite of a few hours sleeping.\n\nSubcontract companies compete or appeal with overwork, then the prime contractor obtain high efficiency works with low cost. But some small unreasonable things and harmful effects are not reported to above. They could lead to serious accident in this emergency.\n\nIf someone indicates those problems on the conference, Tepco may just answer “we are going to investigate” or “we ask cooperative companies not to do so.”\n\nAnd great information never will be reported. Only the evidences not to damage to themselves will be reported to above for having been subcontracted.\n\nSubcontract companies and dishonesty workers are not only responsible for such this situation but also prime contractor or Tepco. Even if some workers or the companies were punished severely, this problem would not be solved.\n\nStern regulations don’t connect the safety measure. This is the important thing we have to learn from the Train Crash on JR West Fukuchiyama Line(2005), I think.\n\nTepco has to release weaker people from the pressure that they have to hide their overworks. This is hard to carry senses of mission on their back for many people, so we must not to impose the pressures of labor conditions or instability of employment.\n\nI think we should cope with this problem as whole problem of employment system.\n\nIt is best that if Tepco employed all workers and companies. If it is completely unable, I want Tepco to confirm the all workers’ contract situation on their documents completry (though I did not make written agreement), and to check if there are fair wages and insurances.\n\nHow about grasping if there are enough people on each posts or companies?\n\nOrginally, outsourcing is not to waive the responsible of administration but to consign technical works. I hear that the accident is barely saved from the worst crisis nevertheless being unpredictable. In this case, it is important to avoid human errors from the halfway administration or caring workers.\n\nAnd my action went through without someone’s check, it gave an example that there is many ways to pick something by someone who were not satisfied on the present state. This won’t change anything if the security will become improved.\n\nIt is proper measure to improve the employment situation not to make workers unsatisfied. I hope mass-medias to ask Tepco and the government these points.\n\n■ The intention of pointing toward the people who watches the video\n\nI wanted to make a opposite direction against the observation. We still have put the workers on nuclear power plant as “an exceptional subject different from us” by changing the word from “lower workers” to “heros” or “working people”\n\nI wanted to point it out. I think we can't avoid this on watching something through a media.\n\n■ the intention of pointing toward myself through the mobile phone\n\nI also watch workers and this accident through the media, so I can't leaving out of this situation, I thought. And this action content a self-sacrifice by narcissism, it should not acknowledge unconditionally in the social crisis.

  "latent_28166": "It can be a little deceiving to think of Mexico's drug cartels as simply gangsters. Instead, they've blurred boundaries between organized crime and quasi-military insurgents, seized swathes of territory and become some of the world's most dangerous criminal gangs. They've also acquired plenty of firepower to back it up. The Zetas are one of the most disruptive and aggressive of them all. Formed by ex-military men who became armed enforcers for the Gulf Cartel, the Zetas split with their former patrons nearly three years ago and have since become one of Mexico's largest and most dangerous cartels. While most of those ex-military founding fathers of the cartel are now dead or in prison, they've retained a culture of military loyalties, if not so much the discipline and hierarchy. Or much in the way of taste. In September, Mexican police arrested Ramiro Pozos, the alleged leader of drug gang \"The Resistance\" and Zeta ally -- with his gold- and silver-plated AK-47. Meanwhile, coming up on Saturday, incoming president Enrique Pena Nieto takes office, the first change in the presidency since the drug war exploded across the country more than six years ago. Aside from reducing the level of violence, one of his priorities will be wrenching back control of cartel territory, and putting it back under the control of the state. It won't be easy. To enforce their claims, the Zetas — and other criminal groups like the Sinaloa Cartel and the Gulf Cartel — deploy an extensive amount of hardware, nearly rivaling Mexico's own military. Police forces are often corrupted or threatened into compliance, and almost always outgunned. Here's a look at seven examples why. Photo: AP\n\nUnder the Gun The Mexican army regularly seizes arsenals of small arms from stockpiles, abandoned after firefights or concealed inside vehicles driven by drug traffickers. In June, a \"narco rebellion\" in the border city of Piedras Negras resulted sporadic firefights lasting hours. After it was over, the military had turned up 50 AK-47 rifles, along with grenade launchers, various machine guns, shotguns and bolt-action rifles. But the cartels are also getting increasingly more powerful guns. In March, firefights between police and the Zetas netted both M-60 and a .30-caliber Browning machine gun. <ahref target=\"_blank\">Sniper rifles and machine guns up to the .50-caliber size have been discovered. The Mexican military has even turned up a German MG34 machine gun from World War II.</ahref> An open question is where the cartels get their guns. It's generally accepted the bulk come from two places: The United States and Central America. In April, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found that 68,000 out of 99,000 guns discovered in Mexico and submitted to the ATF since 2007 originated in the United States. That's about 68 percent of the total submitted for tracing. The subject is also fraught with U.S. domestic politics, and was at the heart of the scandal around the ATF's botched Fast and Furious operation, which resulted in an estimated 2,000 straw-purchased firearms being smuggled into Mexico after purchase in Arizona gun stores. Photo: AP\n\nDrug Gangs ... With Grenades Hand-lobbed grenades are unfortunately quite common, and hundreds of grenades have reportedly been detonated in Mexico in 2012 alone. In 2009, \"spillover\" violence came to the forefront of concerns over border security after someone threw a South Korean fragmentation grenade into a strip club in Pharr, Texas. The grenade didn't explode, but was later traced to another batch of imported grenades that were lobbed at the U.S. consulate in Monterrey and a TV news studio. Rocket-propelled grenade launchers are some of the heaviest weapons possessed by the cartels, and owe their introduction to the region during the Cold War conflicts in Central America. The launchers have also been reportedly stolen from military stockpiles in countries like El Salvador and Honduras and smuggled across the border into Mexico. They've been used in retaliatory attacks against the police and army following the arrest of cartel bosses, and Heriberto Lazcano — the former Zetas boss killed by Mexican marines in early October — was also reportedly packing one. Later in October, several Mexican cops came close to being on the receiving end. A police SWAT team in the border city of Piedas Negras stopped a stolen van when they were fired on by gunmen. The gunmen fled the van on foot, but left behind a Soviet-made RPG-7 launcher with three rockets. It provoked El Narco author Ioan Grillo to note: \"If the criminals had got a rocket off, they could easily have blown the SWAT vehicle to pieces.\" Photo: AP\n\nRoad Warriors One of the most overt expressions of cartel power is the convoy. They're how the cartels move when moving in force, like a narco-trafficking blitzkrieg. A single convoy can number into the dozens of SUVs and trucks loaded down with gunmen, and a single grupo de limpieza, or \"cleanup squad,\" can pose a formidable and fast-moving danger. Some vehicles are armored, with steel welded inside interior compartments and paneling. Other than armored plates in the doors and bulletproof glass for windows, cartel vehicles have been seen with armored sunscreens that flip up to act as a shield for a gunman poking out the top. Sniper perches have been spotted fitted to the beds of pickup trucks, and the cartels have even outfitted vehicles with nail- and oil-spraying gadgets like James Bond. A related tactic is to carjack motorists and use their vehicles as roadblocks: a way to slow the authorities down while operating in cities. The cartels have also taken to randomly shooting out car tires to block traffic during firefights.\n\nThe Monster Because too much is apparently never enough for narcos, the cartels were spotted last year with their own \"tanks.\" That's bit of a misnomer, as the \"tanks\" are not tracked vehicles, and more like souped-up armored monster trucks à la Mad Max. Mexican authorities have reportedly seized more than 100 of the cartel \"monsters,\" which come in varying DIY designs, include firing ports and turrets, room for up to 12 gangsters at a time plus an armored steel shell. The biggest versions appear to be retrofitted dump trucks and semi-trucks. <object classid=\"clsid:d27cdb6e-ae6d-11cf-96b8-444553540000\" codebase=\"http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=6,0,40,0\" height=\"480\" width=\"640\"><param name=\"src\" value=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/tQc61D_nq5k?version=3&hl=en_US\"></param><param name=\"allowfullscreen\" value=\"true\"></param><embed allowfullscreen=\"true\" allowscriptaccess=\"always\" height=\"480\" src=\"http://www.youtube-nocookie.com/v/tQc61D_nq5k?version=3&hl=en_US\" type=\"application/x-shockwave-flash\" width=\"640\"></embed></object> But there's also a practical reason for having them. With so much firepower being thrown around between rival gangsters, blow-torching steel plates onto a semi-truck seems like the logical thing to do, albeit from the perspective of a drug cartel. Photo: AP\n\nThe Incredible Flying Drug Mule To move drugs across the border and over border walls, the cartels have taken to using flying clever contraptions like this ultralight, home-brewed flying cocaine mule. Closer to gliders than an actual plane, ultralight planes are small, cost around $3,000 and their engines purr quietly. Some don't even have to land, and can literally release a harness carrying a drug load down to a waiting friend below. The downside is that they move slowly, but can also fly low and hide from the Border Patrol's radars. Their use is also on the upsurge. U.S. Customs and Border Protection spotted 223 flights in 2011, double that of 2009. Few are ever caught. Photo: ChuckHolton/Flickr\n\nAttack of the Bombs Car bombs were uncommon among cartels only a few years ago, and are normally associated in the country with Anarchists and left-wing militant groups. Today, the bombs are still relatively rare, but have been showing up more in ambushes on military patrols. Car bombs have been repeatedly blown up outside newspaper offices and police stations, causing relatively few casualties but with the intent to terrorize and intimidate. Sporadic car bombings have also occurred in the border city of Nuevo Laredo, as rival drug gangs fight over control of the lucrative turf. An open question is whether the cartels will take the route of the infamous drug lord Pablo Escobar, who once used car bombs to inflict mass casualties on the Colombian public. But Mexico's gangsters haven't indicated they will so far, perhaps seeing it in their interest to avoid bringing down too much heat from the authorities. An alleged 2009 Iranian-Zetas bomb plot to kill the Saudi ambassador in Washington was met with disbelief — the alleged plotter was never confirmed to have actually met with anyone from the Zetas. There's also a difference between a \"car bomb\" and a bomb that happens to be placed in a car. Many vehicle-borne bombs used by the cartels have been fairly small — sometimes just a few sticks of dynamite in a trunk — compared to a large and powerful bomb that could potentially level a building. But the cartels also appear to be building more sophisticated bombs, and have been discovered with military-grade mines. In May, Mexican troops fought a group of drug traffickers in the state of Zacatecas, killed three of them, and seized an arsenal of weapons including a M18A1 Claymore anti-personnel mine. The Claymore can blast hundreds of steel balls at a range of more than 300 feet, and is used by the U.S. military, though is also widely copied around the world. Even more worrying was that the mine was seized together with its detonator wire and firing device, meaning it could have been usable.",

  "latent_28265": "In the aftermath of Imperial Japan’s surprise attack upon the U.S. Military at Pearl harbor, fear and uncertainty gripped the United States. Americans of Japanese heritage were suspected of divided loyalties or worse. On February 19, 1942, President Franklin Roosevelt issued Executive Order 9066 enabling the Secretary of War to declare “Military Zones” and ultimately authorizing the internment of more than 100,000 Japanese-Americans in “War Relocation Centers.”\n\nThe internment of Japanese Americans potentially applied to anyone who had a Japanese great grandparent or closer heritage, so that citizens of Chinese-Japanese heritage were affected; Koreans were affected as well, since Japan had governed Korea for almost 40 years by the time of Pearl harbor. (It is notable that almost none of the more than half-million Chinese-Americans in the US during the war years were affected by this “relocation” effort. China was a U.S. ally in the war with Japan.) Was this internment order inspired by racism and bigotry? In large part, no doubt. Simple greed was a major factor as well, profiteering knowing no limits of race. Many of the Japanese-Americans who were subject to internment had to sell their homes and possession on very short notice and at greatly undervalued prices. As noted, the action was not applied to people simply because they were from East Asia. The Japanese were specifically targeted.\n\nOf the ten internment camps that were established in 1942 and 1943 in support of the relocation effort, Manzanar in California’s Owens Valley is the most well-known. This is due to three factors: it was the first of the “War Relocation Centers” (WRCs) to be opened, in March of 1942; it was the largest, and it has been preserved as a National Historic Park.\n\nOne of the aspects of these camps that is worth calling to mind is that while they were truly “Concentration Camps” in the original sense of the word, they were not in the same category as the concentration camps in Nazi-occupied Europe which gave that term such an especially evil and murderous reputation. In fact, the American Jewish Committee at one time strenuously objected to the use of the term “Concentration Camp” to refer to the WRCs, as the WRCs were demonstrably far different from Nazi camps. The WRCs featured stores, schools, hospitals, recreation facilities of sorts, and libraries. These were not comfortable facilities, and no one would wish to be imprisoned even in a palace, but they were not intentionally physically brutalizing.\n\nThese camps were Spartan, to say the least. The accommodations were meager and only just barely adequate, being built of boards and tarpaper, and having minimal heating, no cooling. At a place such as Manzanar, in the high desert, the cold could be fierce and the heat intense. The facilities, though, were basically the same as the barracks used by members of the armed forced at the time, and so were not intentionally harsh. There were no “permanent” buildings at these camps. Some structures were placed upon concrete slabs, and a few had masonry foundations, but none were of brick. The guard towers were wood-frame construction in all the camps. Costs were kept low.\n\nI had the moving experience of meeting a former inmate of Manzanar a few years ago in California when I attended a memorial service for Ruth Colburn, the mother of a College classmate. She had served as head librarian at Manzanar from 1942 through 1945. In that capacity, she made many deep and lasting friendships, and she earned the respect and affection of many of the camp’s inmates, as reflected in the fact that one of the “alumni” of Manzanar, a gentleman in his early 80s, remembered that she had been a gracious and kind presence in a difficult and stressful circumstance. He had been a teenager at Manzanar, and had evidently taken full advantage of the library that was provided.\n\nGrowing up in California, I had the chance to know a few people of Japanese heritage who had been sent to these “War Relocation Centers.” Frank Kamada, a nurseryman, had been interned at Camp Jerome in Arkansas. Frank recalled such things as being “deloused” by being showered in Malathion insecticide, and having to play baseball with ball of string wrapped in medical adhesive tape copped from first aid kits. Frank also remembered being allowed outside the camp to work for and with local farmers, and teaching the Arkansan farmers techniques of soil conservation and improvement which originated in Japan. Frank spoke of this time without apparent bitterness or regret. “We were at war,” he once observed. Note that use of “we.” Frank was Nisei, a 2nd generation Japanese descendant. He identified as American, as did his parents. But they were all interned.\n\nWhen my folks owned a flower shop in the early 1970s, we did a great deal of business with vendors in the “Japanese Market.” Los Angeles’ wholesale flower market – in those days second only to Amsterdam’s – occupied two city blocks on either side of Wall Street in downtown LA. On the south side was the American Exchange, on the north was the Japanese Market. Many of the folks who owned concessions or worked in the market were Nisei or Sansei (3rd generation) who had been in the camps or had family who had been interned. Sada Miyahara (who anually on 17 March donned vibrant green and wore a green plaid tam on his head, would proclaim, “I’m Irish: Me O’Hara!”) had been at Tule Lake WRC. He recalled his time there frankly, but, again, without any grudge.\n\nI was then and remain to this day struck by how little resentment or bitterness was expressed by these people to whom so great an injustice had been done. No doubt some small number of those imprisoned were loyal to the Emperor, but even these could hardly have constituted a meaningful threat to the U.S. But one must bear in mind that the shock of war was profound and dramatic, and that the suddenness of the surprise attack that brought us into it alarmed people in a way that even the 9/11 terrorist attacks did not. This does not excuse the internments, but it does help to explain them.\n\nI would not aim to lessen the grim and oppressive aspect of these camps. Their very existence is a proof enough of oppression and discrimination. But as my brother observed, “I was appalled then (and am now) to think that US citizens could be treated that way but I was also struck by the complete lack of rancor evident when these folks told about their wartime experiences. I doubt I would be as calm in retelling such a tale. All the same, it seems, in a small way, more humane and civilized to know that those camps were provided with libraries and trained librarians. Somebody was thinking. How nice to know that Ruth Colburn was one of the people who made our internment camps something far less odious than what the Germans and Japanese had to offer the world at the time.”\n\nExecutive Order 9066 was officially rescinded by President Gerald Ford on 19 February 1976. Under President Jimmy Carter, a commission was established to fully investigate and evaluate the motive and the impact of Executive Order 9066. Eventually, reparation payments were made to living internees and the Federal Government formally apologized for the internment. While money and conciliatory words cannot truly redress an old wrong, remembering and reflecting may help us to avoid repeating the episode in some future time of fright and trepidation. Executive Order 9066 remains a part of our American past that must not be forgotten.\n\n+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-+-=-\n\nJamie Rawson\n\nFlower Mound, Texas\n\nTo do injustice is more disgraceful than to suffer it. — Plato",

  "latent_28492": "Consumer data companies are selling lists of rape victims, seniors with dementia and even those suffering from HIV and AIDS to marketers, underscoring the need for tighter government regulations, a privacy group told Congress Wednesday.\n\nThe World Privacy Forum uncovered these lists, along with several others, while investigating how data brokers collect and sell consumer information. Marketers buy this data so they can target shoppers based on everything from their income to clothing size.\n\nOther lists the nonprofit found included the home addresses of police officers, a mailing list for domestic violence shelters (which are typically kept secret by law) and a list of people with addictive behaviors towards drug and alcohol.\n\nThe mere existence of these lists highlights the need for increased government regulations, said World Privacy Forum executive director Pam Dixon.\n\nRelated: What your zip code reveals about you\n\n\"This is where I urge Congress to take action,\" she said Wednesday at a Senate committee hearing. \"Highly sensitive data are the frayed and ugly ends of the bell curve of lists, far from the center. This is where lawmakers can work to remove unsafe, unfair and overall just deplorable lists from circulation.\"\n\nCurrently, data brokers are required by federal law to maintain the privacy of a consumer's data only if it is used for credit, employment, insurance or housing. And while medical privacy laws prohibit doctors from sharing patient information, medical information that data brokers get elsewhere, such as from the purchase of over-the-counter drugs and other health care items, is fair game.\n\nIn some cases, such lists could put people in harm's way. The list of more than 30,000 police officers' home addresses, for example, could put the lives of the officers and their families in danger, said Dixon. Meanwhile, a list of seniors suffering from dementia could open them up to predatory financial offers.\n\nRelated: Find out what Big Data knows about you\n\nLinda Woolley, president of the Direct Marketing Association, said in a statement that such lists represent a \"tiny minority\" of marketing products.\n\n\"We recognize that there are situations in which lists are being used to disparage certain groups,\" she said. \"That is not something that DMA supports.\"\n\nShe added that some names of lists may be misleading as to the information it contains and that most lists typically focus on a person's likely interests, such as whether someone is a \"sports enthusiast\" or \"avid traveler.\"\n\nSome data brokers offer ways to opt out, but many have unclear opt-out procedures or none at all. Plus, most consumers have no idea they're on the lists in the first place, said Dixon.\n\nRelated: What your wireless carrier knows about you\n\nWednesday's hearing came after a year-long Senate committee investigation into the $156 billion data brokerage industry.

The WWE mega-star was slapped with a one-year suspension by USADA last month following two positive tests for clomiphene last summer. Reports suggested that Lesnar could have returned following serving his MMA ban after July 15, 2017, but this looks to have been proven as false information.\n\nLesnar was a former UFC heavyweight champion, and a popular figure with fans. Should the wrestler backtrack on retirement plans, he would need to serve the remaining five months of his initial suspension, which would begin from any return drug-testing pool:\n\n“Pursuant to the UFC Anti-Doping Policy, all UFC athletes serving a period of ineligibility for an anti-doping policy violation are required to remain in the USADA registered testing pool and make themselves available for testing in order to receive credit for time served under his or her sanction,” USADA’s press release regarding Lesnar’s sanction stated. “Furthermore, if an athlete retires during his or her period of ineligibility, the athlete’s sanction will be tolled until such time the athlete notifies USADA of his or her return from retirement and once again makes him or herself available for no-advance-notice, out-of-competition testing.”\n\nLesnar’s only fight since an initial departure from the UFC almost five years ago came in his victory against Mark Hunt at UFC 200.

  "latent_28599": "On Friday, the Trump administration released long-anticipated rules that relax the Obama-era birth control mandate, which required employers to offer insurance that covered contraception for women.\n\nEffective immediately, some companies can now more easily refuse to cover the cost of birth control by seeking religious or moral exemptions.\n\nTo justify this rollback, the administration wrote pages into the new regulations that challenge well-established research on the health impact of birth control — from whether contraceptives reduce unwanted pregnancies to the harms and benefits of the Pill.\n\nAltogether, the case presented against birth control is a stunning distortion of the research on contraception. And it’s anything but novel.\n\nThere is a long history of false information shaping women’s health law and policy — part of a broader push to curtail women’s reproductive rights in America. “[These birth control regulations] seem to be part of this larger effort to roll back women’s health care, roll back access to reproductive options,” said Diane Horvath-Cosper, a fellow with Physicians for Reproductive Health. “It certainly looks like [the administration is] misusing science to that end.”\n\nHere’s a quick rundown of the various abuses of science that surfaced in the government’s new birth control regulations. Many will be familiar — they echo claims the religious right has been making about the effects of contraception for years.\n\nYes, birth control does decrease the number of unplanned pregnancies\n\nAccording to the White House, there isn’t good evidence linking access to birth control to lower rates of unintended pregnancies. More specifically, we don’t actually know that giving more women birth control reduces the risk of unwanted pregnancies at the population level, the new regulations say: “In particular, association and causality can be hard to disentangle.”\n\nWhat the White House doesn’t mention is that you cannot do a causation-proving experiment on birth control. We know birth control works to reduce the risk of pregnancy, so it would not be ethical to randomly assign some women to use contraception while withholding it from others and waiting to see what happens.\n\nThe research we have on the population-level impact of contraceptives is indeed observational, and observational studies can only describe correlations between phenomena, not causation. But even given the limitations, it’s extremely informative.\n\nJust take a look at the research from the CHOICE Project, out of Washington University in St. Louis. For this work, researchers gave out free contraceptives to local teenagers, and followed them for up to three years to see what happened to their rates of pregnancy and abortion.\n\nThey published the results in a study in the New England Journal of Medicine: CHOICE participants were significantly less likely to get pregnant and have abortions compared to their American counterparts. As you can see in the chart above, women enrolled in CHOICE had birth rates, abortion rates, and pregnancy rates that were less than half that of the average American. (You can read all about the project here and here.)\n\n“What this shows is that when you take away costs, when you take away barriers, you see increases in the use of more effective methods of birth control and a substantial decline among adolescent pregnancies,” said Megan L. Kavanaugh, principal research scientist at the Guttmacher Institute, adding that the CHOICE research is some of the best data out there on the effect of birth control on unwanted pregnancies.\n\nThe White House’s claim about correlation and causation also ignores one very basic thing about birth control: It works!\n\nOn the individual level, birth control is extremely effective at stopping women from getting pregnant. “If there wasn’t any use of methods of birth control, 85 percent of reproductive-age women would get pregnant every year, and we’re not near that,” said Leslie Kantor, vice president of education at Planned Parenthood and a professor at Columbia University’s Mailman School of Public Health. “So [this administration] is ignoring a lot of evidence to suggest we don’t know really well what birth control does.”\n\nAs to why the White House is ignoring the evidence, we have some clues. One of the architects behind the new birth control rules is reportedly Matthew Bowman, a lawyer at the Department of Health and Human Services who worked for Alliance Defending Freedom, a Christian legal advocacy (and anti-choice) group. Another top Trump adviser on health care is Katy Talento, an anti-abortionist who has claimed that side effects of hormonal birth include cancer and miscarriages. Trump put Teresa Manning, another anti-abortion lawyer who once said giving people easy access to the morning-after pill was \"medically irresponsible\" and \"anti-family,” in charge of Title X, HHS’s federal family planning program. Trump’s positions on abortion have been wishy-washy, but it’s well known that Vice President Mike Pence has been crusading against reproductive rights for years.\n\nExpanding birth control access hasn’t encouraged risky sex\n\nAnother argument the Trump administration cites in limiting access to contraceptives is that a birth control coverage mandate could “affect risky sexual behavior in a negative way.” In other words, give more women birth control and they’ll be more promiscuous.\n\nNo matter where you stand on the sexual freedom spectrum, this is another well-studied issue, and the best available evidence suggests birth control does not increase risky sexual behaviors.\n\nStudies have looked at whether giving people access to contraception encourages people to have more sex. It doesn’t. Most women in the CHOICE study reported no change in their number of sexual partners after gaining access to free birth control. They were also no more likely to be diagnosed with sexually transmitted infections.\n\nWhat’s more, the introduction of the Obamacare birth control mandate in 2012, which expanded access to contraception, has actually coincided with a period of less risky sexual behavior among Americans.\n\nConsider the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey, which has been tracking teen’s sex lives since the early 1990s. That study finds kids these days are actually less sexually active. Here’s Christopher Ingraham at the Washington Post explaining the findings before and after the Obamacare mandate:\n\nThe proportion of high school students who ever had sex dropped from 47.4 percent in 2011 to 41.2 percent in 2015. The share who were currently sexually active fell from 33.7 to 30.1 percent. Similar declines were apparent among the rate of teens having sex before age 13, and the share of teens having four or more sexual partners.\n\nThe latest federal data also shows that the teen birth rate has plummeted in recent years, from 41.5 births per 1,000 teenage girls in 2007 to 20.3 births per 1,000 teenage girls in 2017. And what contributed to the change? Birth control.\n\nAs Vox’s Sarah Kliff reported in September, “The percentage of sexually active teens who used at least one type of birth control the last time they had sex rose from 78 percent in 2007 to 86 percent in 2012.” More youngsters are also using more effective types of birth control, such as pills, IUDs, or implants.\n\nThe benefits of birth control outweigh its negative effects\n\nAnother reason the White House doesn’t want to require companies cover contraception for women? “[The] positive health effects might also be partially offset by an association with negative health effects,” according to the new regulations.\n\nThey go on to cite research suggesting oral contraceptives increases the risk of deep vein thrombosis in women, and question the Pill’s effects on cancer risk.\n\nEvery medical intervention has harms and benefits. But in this case, the Trump administration exaggerates the harms and undermines the benefits. With oral contraceptives, Alina Salganicoff, vice president and director of women’s health policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told me that both the Institute of Medicine and the Women's Preventive Services Initiative have reviewed the totality of the evidence for the contraceptive products on the market and determined that their benefits vastly outweigh their harms, so much so that they recommended birth control be a required preventive health service for women.\n\nLet’s consider the White House claim about hormonal contraceptives increasing the risk of deep vein thrombosis, or blood clotting. There is indeed a small risk increase that comes with using hormonal birth control, but in the vast majority of women, this side effect never materializes.\n\n“To put the risk in context,\" as NHS Choices, a fantastic medical information service from the UK government, pointed out, \"you are far more likely to develop a blood clot in pregnancy than by using a combined contraceptive.\" For example, the NHS says, there are about five to 12 cases of blood clotting per 10,000 women who use oral contraceptives for a year — a small boost compared with women who are not on the Pill and who generally have two blood clot cases per 10,000.\n\nOn cancer, according to a World Health Organization review of the evidence, taking birth control pills “slightly” modifies the risk of various cancers — but this effect goes in both directions: There’s an association with an increased risk for some cancers, and a decrease for others. Through the Food and Drug Administration, however, “The federal government has found that every approved method of birth control has net positive health benefits for most women, or else they wouldn’t be approved for use in this country,” said Adam Sonfield, senior policy manager at the Guttmacher Institute, in an email.\n\n“We have an incredible amount of research that shows that contraception is safe,” said Horvath-Cosper, from Physicians for Reproductive Health. “The risks for the vast majority of people are much smaller than the benefits, and the benefit is they work to prevent pregnancy and they’re really good at doing that.”\n\nFor Kantor, Friday’s move by the administration is just another way to attack women’s advancement by limiting their reproductive rights in ways that’ll harm their health. And in a country that already has extremely poor health outcomes for women on many measures, that should be worrying.\n\n“I think everybody who cares about science is concerned there’s a lot of non-science making its way into regulations,” said Kantor, “not just on [reproductive health] but other topics as well.”",

The winner of the tournament will be awarded a custom follower, which will be hard-coded into the mod by their steam ID: http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=787953139 *model by RiceKunThere will be 3 separate, double-elimination brackets. Each bracket will be for a different region (America, Europe, Asia), to allow those with different time zones to compete. There will only be 1 game per match-up. Games should be played within the following time ranges:You can only sign up for one bracket, but which bracket you choose is totally up to you, as long as you are available on most days during the standard play time. Sorry if these time slots don't fit your particular schedule/time zone. The winners of each of these brackets will play each other in single-elimination matches for the finals (the region with the most sign-ups will get a BYE).I will use challonge.com for the brackets. You'll need to make an account in order to sign up, but it is a pretty quick process. After you make an account, users should sign up with their steam ID in their name (ie. \"Sancho (76561197962338210)\"), to make it easier for their opponent to find them. You can find your steam ID by going to your steam profile page, and copying the last part of the URL.17:00-23:00 (UTC-8): America 17:00-23:00 (UTC+0): Europe 17:00-23:00 (UTC+8): Asia Basic English will be helpful.Users can add their opponent to friends directly on steam to communicate a time to play. Alternatively, you can use this group to organize games: TTS Carcassonne . Use either the group chat room or create a discussion thread. You will need to contact your opponent by yourself. I won't babysit.If your opponent isn't responsive, mention it publicly in a discussion thread. Do not add me to your friends, I'll decline it. I suspect at least half of the signups or possibly more will be no shows, so I will not hesitate to disqualify anyone that isn't communicating well. Don't take it personally. I just need to keep things moving.If a match is not completed within 24 hours, and I haven't heard from either player, both will be disqualified. The finals will be given more leeway, since it will be players from different time zones trying to coordinate. I realize this is a strict schedule, but in my experience giving more leeway doesn't actually allow more people to play, it just drags things out needlessly. Still, if you need an extension, make a thread and I'll see if an exception can be made.All games will be preferably played on the Scripted Carcassonne mod and the rules enforced by the mod should be followed. If there is a script issue, please try to recover the game by saving and loading. If all else fails, complete the game without scripting. If something happens to mess up the game to a state you can't recover (ie. score gets messed up and neither player can figure out how to undo it, or pieces are removed and you can't remember where they should go), you'll unfortunately have to restart (sorry!)I wanted to give people the opportunity to vote for the \"standard expansions\" they want to play with. I put up a poll here so people can vote: Expansion Poll I'll probably take every expansion that gets more than a certain percentage of votes, but I'm not quite sure what that will be at this point. Will be announced at the start of the tournament.Players are welcome to deviate from this standard and play with whatever expansions they want, as long as both opponents should agree. Putting pressure on your opponent to agree to an expansion that they don't want is considered poor sportsmanship. Each player has the right to request the \"standard expansions\" if they aren't comfortable with the suggested expansions.The winner will report their own victory (score isn't required if you forget it). I strongly suggest liberal use of save games and screenshots, in the event that there isn't agreement on the outcome of the game.Common sense applies. Sportsmanship is mandatory and the lack thereof could disqualify you. There's a fairly significant luck factor in this game. We all know it. Sometimes you will lose to someone you are better than. Take your loss elegantly; try not to take the tournament too seriously and have fun.Good luck!",
  "latent_28716": "A Kanye West, Rihanna, Ty Dolla $ign & Paul McCartney collaboration is going \"to drop soon.\"\n\nIf there's one cardinal, but unspoken, rule for musicians, it's that when Kanye West calls, you answer. So when Yeezy summoned Ty Dolla $ign to record with him this past September, the West Coast crooner gladly hopped on a plane to Mexico.\n\nOver the span of two days, Ty Dolla $ign and West recorded roughly nine songs together, including \"Only One,\" on which he sings background vocals. West dropped the emotional ode to his daughter, North West, just before the stroke of midnight on New Year's Eve. The song, featuring Paul McCartney, is sung from the perspective of West's late mother Dr. Donda West.\n\nKanye West's 'Only One': An Ode to Happiness & Healing\n\nIn the first of a two-part exclusive interview with Billboard, Ty Dolla $ign talks about working with 'Ye on \"Only One\" and the eight other tracks that they churned out over the course -- one of which happens to be a collaboration with Rihanna and McCartney.\n\nWith thanks to these sessions, it looks like 2015 is already turning into the year of Ty Dolla $ign.\n\nHow did you end up working with Kanye West?\n\nOne day my homie Ricky Anderson [Kanye's cousin] hit me up and was like, 'Kanye wants you to come work with him in Mexico,' so I came out there [and] we did like nine songs in one day; one of them happened to be 'Only One.'\n\nDid you know he was going to drop \"Only One\" on New Year's Eve, or were you surprised like everybody else?\n\nNah, they called me before and told me. Atlantic [Records] called and asked me to clear it and everything. I didn't know what song 'Only One' was at first, then the other homie called me and played me the song [to refresh my memory]. It came out, everybody's going crazy. They playing it on the radio, every city, every state, every country, so shit, I'm happy!\n\nHow did it feel to wake up and hear your voice on \"Only One\"?\n\nIt's like running track and getting a gold medal. Constant gold medals!\n\nWhat was the recording process like?\n\n[In] like 24 hours, [we recorded] seven songs or nine songs that day. I was like, 'I'm here with Kanye, I'm not gonna waste my time.' They really wanted me to stay for like a week, but I only had like two days, 'cause I was about to start the [Under the Influence of Music] tour.\n\nHe was open to my input, like, 'do whatever you want to do. Here's your mic. Do you need anything?' I'm like 'Awesome! Let's get it!'\n\n[We were] in Mexico, at this big house. The back of the house had no walls and no doors; it was just open [and facing] the ocean. You would think he would want the mic enclosed and all that but we just had the doors open, and it came out perfect. That inspired me to record like that at the crib.\n\nEverybody [on his team] is into all the dope shit that's out and they said that my [Beach House] project was one of them.\n\nWhat did you learn from working with 'Ye?\n\nJust take my time and really examine what's dope and what's not. He reminds me of myself a lot. [He has] all the homies around, everybody being like 'yes' or 'no' [about a song]. Also, be real critical about what you do, [and] not just let anything go out there.\n\nAt first, I was wondering what he was gonna' think and all that shit, but I was like 'I'ma just do this like I'm doing it for myself' and everybody fucked with it. I gave that nervous shit up a couple years back and that's when I was able to get it pippin.' At first, I ain't gon' lie, I used to be a little nervous about what people were gon' think about my music but once I let that go, then everything started happening.\n\nWhat can you tell me about the other songs you worked on with 'Ye?\n\nMe, Rihanna, 'Ye and Paul [Mc Cartney] got a song about to drop as well...\n\nIt's featured on 'Ye's album?\n\nYeah. It's gonna drop soon. I heard they shot the video recently. I don't know what the final title is, but I know it's crazy so just be looking out for [it].\n\nRight now I'm focussing on -- since we got all his stuff done -- I'm trying to get him on my album [laughs]. I'm just waiting for that date that he's like, \"Yeah cool, let's do it.\" I'm finishing up my album right now, and I definitely want to get that 'Ye joint on there.\n\nDo you know how many of your features made the album's final cut?\n\nI'm not sure which ones are gonna make the final [cut], but there's a couple for sure.\n\nI don't want to talk about his album, I want him to present it how he wants to present it.

Sadly, the same cannot be said for the name of the artist who wrote that song.\n\nI refuse to go the way of Flea and Ice Cube. Great artists rendered unsearchable by virtue of their names’ alternate associations. Maybe we could solve this whole problem if we just made the searches case-sensitive.

  "latent_29714": "Majority are pro-UK, even in Scotland, but ideas vary either side of border on whether whole of Britain should have its say\n\nA strong majority across the UK favours keeping the kingdom united, according to a new Guardian/ICM poll. But as Scotland's first minister Alex Salmond prepares to publish his plans for an independence referendum this week, there are very different ideas in England and Scotland about whether it should be for the whole of Britain or for Scots alone to seal the union's fate.\n\nSome 68% of respondents across Britain say \"the UK is stronger together\", as against just 24% who believe England and Scotland \"are proud nations in their own right\", which could thrive on their own.\n\nThe unionist balance of opinion is evident across England, as well as Scotland and Wales. The pro-UK majority exceeds two to one in every case, even among Scots who back the union on this question by a 63%-30% margin. The Scotland-only results necessarily rely on a much smaller sample, but are in line with the findings of other recent polls in suggesting that Salmond has a mountain to climb.\n\nA recent YouGov survey of Scottish voters for Channel 4 news pointed to a 61%-39% referendum defeat for independence.\n\nDavid Cameron started the political year by demanding the Scottish government set out how the referendum would be run, but he ran into a furious reaction from the SNP administration at Holyrood, which accused him of trying to dictate the terms and the timing from London. Cameron's involvement wins some support from voters – and in Scotland as well as England.\n\nAcross Britain as a whole, only 28% deem that \"it is for the Scottish government to manage Scotland's referendum\" as against 61% who judge that London is right to want \"a say on the ground rules\" because \"independence would affect the whole UK\".\n\nEven among Scottish respondents, a majority, 56%, take the latter position, against just 39% who think that the plebiscite is Scotland's to manage alone. Over the weekend it appeared London and Edinburgh were inching closer on the referendum's management, with reports that Holyrood can accept the involvement of the UK-wide electoral commission, so long as it is subjected to Scottish oversight.\n\nBut if the poll points to compromise over how the referendum is managed, there are sharp differences between the Scots and the English when it comes to who should get to take part. A clear majority of Scottish respondents, some 55%, believe that in or out of the UK, \"Scotland's future is a matter for the Scottish people alone\". By contrast, two-thirds of voters in both England (66%) and Wales (65%) judge that \"Scotland's future is very important for the whole UK, and so should not be settled without the people of England and Wales being consulted in a referendum too\". Fewer than one English voter in every three, just 29%, express contentment with the Scots determining their own course alone.\n\nConservative voters are particularly vehement in the believing that the whole UK deserves a say – some 75% of them say as much. Similarly high proportions of Tories back Cameron's belief that London should have a say in the ground rules of Scotland's referendum (76%), and insist that the UK is stronger together (73%).\n\nThe results come as the IPPR thinktank issues research which suggests that growing numbers of voters in England believe that their country gets a raw deal out of the union as currently arranged. The report finds that twice as many English voters as in 2007 now believe that Scottish devolution has left Britain being worse governed. It also charts an increasing tendency for the English to believe that the Scots get more than their share of public spending, although English opinion has not yet coalesced on any single response, such as barring Scottish MPs from voting on English laws at Westminster or establishing a separate English parliament.

  "latent_29735": "WASHINGTON ― A draft version of a House Republican bill to repeal and “replace” the Affordable Care Act shows how the move would weaken or eliminate coverage for an untold number of people on Medicaid and private health insurance.\n\nHouse Republicans, led by Speaker Paul Ryan (R-Wis.), appear to be putting the finishing touches on the legislative vehicle with which they intend to eliminate former President Barack Obama’s signature health care law and put in place a new system ― one that would provide significantly less funding for people seeking health benefits and for states providing Medicaid coverage. Ryan has said that he hopes the House can begin advancing legislation when it comes back from recess next week.\n\nThe draft bill, first reported by Politico’s Paul Demko, carries a Feb. 10 timestamp, and Republicans may have revised their proposal since then. The text does not indicate which lawmakers or committees are responsible for it, and there is a blank space where normally the legislation would include the bill’s title.\n\nBut the draft is consistent with the principles Ryan laid out in his “A Better Way” agenda over the summer, and the basic shape of legislation closely resembles a bill that Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price introduced when he served in the House.\n\nLike those proposals, the draft legislation would generally reduce financial assistance for lower- and middle-income people buying private health insurance. It would also weaken standards for what those plans cover, roll back funding for the Medicaid expansion and create a new tax on employer-provided health insurance.\n\nTaxes on wealthy people would fall, and the law’s controversial individual mandate ― a penalty for people who don’t get coverage ― would go away immediately, although most parts of the law with direct bearing on insurance coverage would not take effect until 2020.\n\nWithout a formal analysis from the Congressional Budget Office ― and without careful study by outside experts, most of whom hadn’t seen the legislation until Friday ― it’s difficult to say exactly how the law might affect premiums, generosity of coverage, the federal budget or the overall number of people with insurance.\n\nSome people would clearly feel better off. Young people, for instance, could buy cheaper insurance ― particularly if they were willing to get less comprehensive coverage than the law currently requires.\n\nBut the number of uninsured Americans, currently at a historic low thanks to the 2010 law, would almost certainly rise if something like this proposal became law. Combined with changes to insurance benefits, the net result of the bill’s changes would likely be dramatically greater exposure to punishing medical bills and reduced access to care ― particularly for people who have serious health problems or who aren’t entirely able to pay for comprehensive coverage on their own.\n\nThis may not be what most people thought when they heard President Donald Trump’s promise that “everybody’s going to be taken care of much better than they’re taken care of now.”\n\nOf course, with Republicans still deeply divided on how to proceed, this proposal would be just an opening bid. Some conservatives in the House and Senate don’t even want to replace the Affordable Care Act, while another, larger faction objects to providing financial assistance at all and has sneered at proposals that include tax credits, calling them “Obamacare-lite.”\n\nThe Senate, for its part, has made no apparent progress on health care legislation and isn’t expected to simply accept what the House proposes.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion poses more of a problem for the repeal effort in the Senate, as well. Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), for example, has already said she can’t support a bill that would cut funding for her state’s Medicaid expansion, while conservatives like Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) say they won’t support a bill that doesn’t end the expansion.\n\nAll of this is taking place in a political environment increasingly hostile for Republicans. Angry constituents are flooding lawmakers’ town halls demanding more details about the “replacement” plan, while polling shows a marked upswing in public approval for the Affordable Care Act and a notable decline in support for repeal.\n\nHere are some of the biggest changes that would take place if something like the House GOP draft bill were to become law:\n\nHelp paying for health insurance\n\nFinancial assistance for people buying coverage would change dramatically. Instead of tax credits that vary based on income, people would be eligible for tax credits that vary based on age, with older customers getting bigger credits.\n\nThis would work out as a nice tax break for people whose incomes, today, qualify them for only a little assistance or none at all. But it means that working- and middle-class people would tend to lose assistance that currently makes it possible for them to buy coverage in the first place.\n\nCritically, the GOP proposal would also eliminate extra subsidies, available under the Affordable Care Act, that reduce out-of-pocket expenses for people whose incomes are below 250 percent of the poverty line, or about $60,000 for a family of four.\n\nYounger versus older people\n\nThe Affordable Care Act doesn’t allow health insurance companies to charge older people more than three times the price for a younger adult. The House GOP plan would increase that limit to five times, although states would have flexibility to set their own rules. This might mean lower premiums for some younger consumers, but older people could pay considerably more.\n\nHealth insurance benefits\n\nUnder the Affordable Care Act, all private plans must cover a variety of benefits, including hospitalizations, prescription drugs, contraception, mental health and maternity. Under the House GOP bill, states would be permitted to establish whatever “essential benefits” they wanted, and leave out the rest.\n\nThe bill also includes a clause that would allow insurers to continue offering “grandfathered” plans, which are exempt from the Affordable Care Act’s standards for benefits and pricing because insurers were selling them before the law took effect. It’s not clear whether these plans would be available to people not already enrolled in them. If they are, that could undermine other regulations on insurance.\n\nPre-existing conditions and the individual mandate\n\nInsurers today cannot deny coverage or charge higher premiums because of health status, as long as people sign up during annual open enrollment or qualify for an exemption for a reason like a move or a new job. But under this proposal, insurers could increase premiums by 30 percent, for up to a year, on people who do not maintain “continuous coverage,” meaning that they let their coverage lapse for more than two months. This would have the biggest effect on lower-income people and people juggling jobs ― particularly because, under the GOP proposal, they would be getting less financial aid from the government.\n\nThe proposal would also eliminate the individual mandate. The mandate exists to make sure healthy people buy coverage, rather than waiting until they get sick. The continuous coverage provision is supposed to serve the same function, but many experts believe it is not as effective.\n\nMedicaid funding\n\nHouse Republicans propose repealing the Affordable Care Act’s Medicaid expansion by eliminating the additional federal funding for it. The federal government and states jointly finance Medicaid, and states historically paid 25 percent to 50 percent of the costs, but the Affordable Care Act provided at least 90 percent of the funding for the expansion population. This draft bill would reduce it to the share paid for other Medicaid beneficiaries.\n\nThe bill also calls for a far more radical change to Medicaid. Since its inception in 1965, Medicaid has been a federal entitlement like Medicare and Social Security, so the government has been obligated to cover the costs of any eligible person without limit. House Republicans want to eliminate this entitlement status and instead send states a flat sum ― known as a per-capita cap ― per enrollee.\n\nThis would leave states on the hook for any costs above that amount, which would be smaller than federal funding today. That would likely lead states to remove people from the rolls, trim benefits and/or cut payment rates to medical providers, reducing coverage and access to care.\n\nHigh-risk pools\n\nIn an attempt to make up for scrapping the Affordable Care Act’s guarantee of coverage for people with pre-existing conditions, the House Republican bill would set aside $100 billion over a decade to finance state programs that would cover people with the highest medical costs.\n\nThis could take the form of high-risk pools, which is a reform Republicans have long favored. Prior to the ACA making them obsolete, these high-risk pools existed in a majority of states, dating back to the 1970s. Inadequate funding, high premiums and lengthy waiting lists meant only a tiny percentage of people otherwise uninsurable had access to this coverage.\n\nThe proposed $100 billion investment would be substantially more than what previous proposals, such as Price’s, allocated. But even so, the investment would probably fall far short of providing coverage for all the people who need it. Both liberal and conservative health experts have speculated that high-risk pools really need more like $150 billion to $250 billion over that time period.\n\nPaying for the plan\n\nThe proposal would wipe out much of the Affordable Care Act’s funding, including new payroll taxes that fall exclusively on the very wealthiest Americans. To make up for some of that loss, the bill would start subjecting a portion of the most generous health plans to taxes. Today the premiums for employer-sponsored insurance do not count toward taxes, so this would effectively be a new tax on the most expensive insurance policies, which many middle-class people hold.\n\nEconomists across the political spectrum have long called for such a change, and the Affordable Care Act actually has a version of this proposal, known as the “Cadillac tax.” But the idea of taxing health benefits is highly unpopular, which is one reason Congress voted two years ago to postpone introduction of the Cadillac tax.\n\n* * *\n\nOne question looming over all of this is how these features could become law. In order to advance legislation in the Senate, where it would normally take 60 votes to overcome a Democratic filibuster, Republicans hope to use the budget reconciliation process, in which a simple majority can pass a bill.\n\nBut reconciliation rules prohibit consideration of changes that don’t directly affect the federal budget, and some of the changes in the draft bill ― like those affecting insurance regulations ― might not pass muster with the Senate parliamentarian, an adviser to the Senate who interprets those rules.",
  "latent_29819": "Several hundred activists were arrested Monday afternoon during a sit-in on the steps of the U.S. Capitol to call for action on voting rights and campaign finance reform.\n\nThe mass civil disobedience, part of a week-long Washington protest known as Democracy Spring, aimed to demonstrate the depth of grassroots frustration at a political system that, participants said, is tilted toward the wealthy at the cost of ordinary Americans. It came as a growing number of observers are expressing concern about the direction and robustness of our democratic system. The first presidential election in over half a century without the full protections of the Voting Rights Act is approaching. Voting restrictions already have played havoc in the primaries. And voters in both major parties are expressing intense anger over a campaign finance system awash in big money donations.\n\nRELATED: Is the GOP purging voters in a pivotal state?\n\nAs the chilly April morning gave way to spring sunshine, around a thousand activists marched from Washington’s Union Station to the Capitol. “Money out, voters in,” they chanted. At the Capitol, a smaller group of several hundred sat down on the building’s eastern steps. Capitol police gave three warnings before beginning arrests, herding protesters in several waiting buses. Some conservative news outlets had in recent weeks appeared to stoke fears of violent or chaotic scenes, but the process was orderly and peaceful throughout.\n\nAmong those arrested were Cenk Uygur, the popular progressive media personality, and Adam Green, who runs the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, which says it represents the “Elizabeth Warren wing” of the Democratic Party.\n\n“We’re here because the government doesn’t represent all the people, and it should,” said Rachel Perkins as she sat at the foot of the Capitol steps and prepared to be arrested.\n\nPerkins traveled from Oakland to participate. Was she nervous about being arrested? “Oh yes!” she said. “But it’s worth it.”\n\nLike Bernie Sanders, the Democratic presidential candidate for whom many attendees expressed support, the organizers of Democracy Spring believe it will be next to impossible to solve the substantive issues that progressives care about – inequality and climate change chief among them – without first reforming our politics.\n\n“We know that if we don’t have a democracy that works for all of us, if we don’t have a government that represents us all, then the crises that we face today threaten our very future,” Kai Newkirk, a progressive activist who played a key role in putting the event together, said from the stage before the march began.\n\nRELATED: Ex-staffer: Wisconsin GOP intended Voter ID law to disenfranchise Dems\n\nThey see threats to voting rights and the flood of corporate money in politics as working together to drown out the voices of regular people.\n\n“Voter suppression is alive and well,” said Samantha Hendricks, who traveled from Portland, Oregon. “Hundreds of thousands if not millions of Americans can’t vote right now because of restrictive voter ID laws.”\n\nBut, Hendricks continued, “even if we’re privileged enough to have the right to vote, we recognize that the Congress isn’t passing laws that are aligned with public opinion. We see that.”\n\nThe activists, some of who had spent the week marching en masse from Philadelphia’s Liberty Bell, want a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling that helped lead to a massive influx of political money from corporations and big donors. They want Congress to embrace innovative public financing systems of the kind recently passed in Seattle and Maine. They want lawmakers to pass legislation that protects voting rights, including restoring to full strength the Voting Rights Act, which was badly weakened by the high court in 2013. Two bills meant to strengthen the VRA have languished in the GOP-controlled Congress for more than a year.\n\nRELATED: House Republican accidentally tells the truth about voter ID\n\nSanders and Hillary Clinton have released detailed policies on how to protect and expand voting rights and how to reduce the influence of big money on politics. None of the three remaining Republican candidates have done so, though Donald Trump has frequently assailed his rivals for being beholden to moneyed donors and portrayed himself as not for sale.\n\nMore civil disobedience is planned for the rest of the week. Legendary civil rights activist Delores Huerta and NAACP president Cornell Brooks are both expected to participate. Starting Saturday, the sit-ins will give way to a series of teach-ins and training sessions lasting through April 18, in what’s being billed Democracy Awakening.",

The Beuhrle family has moved outside of Miami-Dade county so that they can keep their pit bull, Slater.\n\nAccording to Yahoo Sports, the Buehrle’s 18-month old dog, an American Staffordshire Terrier, falls under the county’s pit bull breed ban established in 1989. The pitcher says he would not have signed with the team if it meant giving up Slater, and the family moved to a “dog-friendly development” located in Broward County. Buehrle told the Miami Herald, “It’s kind of ridiculous that because of the way a dog looks, people will ban it. Every kind of dog has good and bad, and that depends on the handlers. If you leave a dog outside all the time, it’ll be crazy. Slater would never do anything harmful.”\n\nHe and his wife Jamie are both spokespeople for the organization Best Friends Animal Society, which took in many of the pit bulls rescued from Michael Vick‘s dog fighting operation, ‘Bad Newz Kennels.’ Buehrle has taken some criticism for his past comments about Vick, saying that he hoped Vick would get hurt while playing football, but has since stood by his statements, saying “I said it. I meant it.” The Buehrles have also helped Best Friends get some of their dogs homes by showcasing adoptable dogs in PSAs aired during his baseball games with the White Sox, a campaign the organization called Sox For Strays.",

  "latent_30847": "This article is part of ECFR's Wider Europe Forum\n\nContrast between Trump’s outbursts and Putin’s restraint shows that Russia’s illiberal worldview still dwarves America’s alt-right.\n\nThere is something profoundly bizarre in finding Vladimir Putin and his spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, sounding more restrained than their American counterparts. It is as though Donald Trump’s White House has transformed into the Kremlin’s id, making the latter look civilized by comparison.\n\nLast week Peskov called out nationalist critics of the controversial film, Matilda, about the purported affair of Tsar Nicholas II, calling their threats against the director “inadmissible”, and labelling ‘Christian State – Holy Russia’ as an extremist organisation. The US equivalent of such a rebuke would be Donald Trump condemning the racist and anti-Semitic attacks coming from his supporters – which have increased since the presidential campaign.\n\nNot only has Trump refrained from doing that, but he conspicuously omitted referring to Jews in a statement on International Holocaust Remembrance Day – a gesture that one can’t help but interpret as reluctance to irritate his nationalist, anti-Semitic base.\n\nSimilarly, he has insisted on referring to “radical Islamic terrorism”, as opposed to just terrorism. And in a conversation with Mexico’s president, he reportedly threatened to send in the troops if Mexico couldn’t contain its “bad hombres”.\n\nFinally, as if in parody of a thin-skinned dictator, he lashed out at Nordstrom’s for their refusal to carry his daughter’s brand, with his press secretary adding that the refusal was a direct attack on the president.\n\nWhile Putin has in the past promised to “waste terrorists in the outhouse” and, in his early years, was not above threatening Western journalists, his rhetoric on issues of race and religion is comparatively restrained. While he may call himself a nationalist, it has been entirely unclear what kind of nationalist he is, and his own statements are often in stark contrast to the right-wing populist movements in the West that are supposedly inspired by him.\n\nFor example, Putin refuses to refer to terrorism as “Islamic.” He has repeatedly spoken out against xenophobia and time and again has pledged to fight “radical nationalism”. While he has had tough things to say on immigration, in 2016 he also ordered a government agency to work on “adapting” migrants, a move that angered the right-wing opposition websites, Sputnik and Pogrom.\n\nIn a society where anti-Semitism is still rife, he was pictured in 2016 on state television with members of the European Jewish Congress, pledging (whether credibly or not is another question) to protect Europe’s Jews, urging those Jews who fled the Soviet Union to return.\n\nFor all the comparisons between Trump’s nascent nationalism and Putin’s, it is Trump’s White House that is mouthing a virulently consistent nationalist agenda while the Kremlin demurs. This is largely because the ideologue of the alt-right, Steve Bannon - a man who reads Italian fascists, whose website proposes issuing quotas for women in science majors, and who talks of overthrowing the state - is Trump’s chief strategist.\n\nIn Russia, that would be like Alexander Dugin, the nationalist-imperialist demagogue with alt-right sympathies, being appointed First Deputy Chief of Staff. But for all the talk of Dugin’s supposedly demonic influence, he was fired from his position at Moscow State University for being too outspoken and, while he is popular, his ideological role is limited. The Kremlin tends to remain above the fray, outsourcing traditionalist ideology to parliamentarians like Yelena Mizulina or billionaire Konstantin Malofeyev, who owns conservative Tsargrad TV channel, has ties to Dugin, and supports pro-Russian separatists in Ukraine. This presence of seeming liberals in the presidential administration allows the Kremlin to distance itself from the managed conservativism emanating from its parliament and other actors and disown it if and when it so chooses.\n\nNativism is already so deeply embedded in the Russian political environment that fanning the flames is unnecessary.\n\nMore to the point, Russia’s nationalists are currently squarely in the opposition, and a spate of arrests among far-right groups earlier this year suggests the Kremlin is worried about the threat they could pose.\n\nWhat, exactly, are we to make of this? Is Putin the last liberal standing among the world’s autocrats? Or, like Pushkin described the Russian government, the only “European” in Russia? Far from it. Rather, Putin’s restraint reflects the fact that nativism is already so deeply embedded in the Russian political environment that fanning the flames is unnecessary.\n\nFor example, last week a law was brought into force under the guise of “traditionalist values” that decriminalized domestic violence in a country with one of the highest mortality rates (14,000 women a year die at the hands of their partners) from domestic abuse in Europe.\n\nAs the second anniversary of the murder of opposition leader Boris Nemtsov approaches, the case has yet to be solved and those who ordered it have yet to face justice. Oppositionist Vladimir Kara-Murza is once again in hospital, with family suspecting he was poisoned. And while I refuse to believe that Putin personally ordered the murders of the dozens of journalists killed on his watch, he has overseen an environment where such attacks are not adequately punished and thus tacitly condoned. Or, as journalist Oleg Kashin, who survived being beaten nearly to death in 2010, told me, “It’s not that the Kremlin directly attacks journalists for writing the truth. It’s that it fosters a culture of violence that normalizes such attacks.”\n\nDistilled to their common denominator, the basic logic of Breitbart’s nativist misogyny matches the socio-political environment of Putin’s Russia. That common denominator is a coercive nihilism that worships power and promotes tribalism, aggression and conspiracy theories. Borne of a disillusionment in the power of political institutions and their capacity to improve a person’s lot, this hopeless cynicism is cloaked by ideologues in the myth of “traditional” values. Far from that, it is rather a corrosion of the values of pluralism, openness and tolerance that have underpinned the legal-rational state and, indeed, much of what civilization has achieved in the last 300 years. These sentiments have already been successfully weaponized by Putin’s Kremlin, while Trump is merely beginning to tap into them.\n\nPutin uses [nationalist rhetoric] with caution to uphold the facade. Trump’s outbursts are, conversely, a testament to his impotence.\n\nPutin’s outward restraint comes from the fact that he requires a crafted veneer of democratic procedure in order to legitimise his government and offset a power vertical in which he rules by signal (a primordial state that Steve Bannon can only dream of). In terms of nationalism and the potential for inter-ethnic conflict, Putin knows full well the real dangers of inadvertently encouraging strife in a country with 21 ethnicities, a considerable Muslim population, and a history of violent inter-ethnic protests. Most importantly, Putin never really needs to raise his voice. A flash of the eyes here, and a media mogul will interpret it as displeasure over his news agency’s reporting – and fire the editors. A sinister look there, and the shares of a metallurgical company come crashing down. Trump’s attack on Nordstrom draws little more than a shrug from the department store and a skewering on Saturday Night Live. In Russia it would spell the end of the company.\n\nPutin knows the power of this political environment, and he uses that power with caution in order to uphold the facade. Trump’s outbursts – and particularly his dismay when the rule of law kicks in and overthrows his executive tantrums – are, conversely, a testament to his impotence.\n\nIt is important to bear these differences in mind as we watch how Americans respond to Trump’s attempts to impose the same coercive nihilism on his country. The behavior of his followers and the corrosion of belief in institutions is indeed worrying and should be taken seriously but, so far, Trump’s White House – whatever its similarities to the Kremlin – is still only a small oprichnina within the American legal-rational state. His posturing should be taken as a chance for that legal-rational state – and the independent judiciary in particular, something that Russia does not have – to flex its muscles.\n\nRead more on: Wider Europe Forum,Wider Europe,European Power",
  "latent_30976": "Rudy Giuliani’s new role advising President-elect Donald Trump on cyber security could provide a financial windfall for the former New York City mayor’s consulting firm and legal practice, creating a potential conflict of interest that won’t be subject to federal ethics laws.\n\nGiuliani chairs the global cybersecurity practice at the law firm Greenberg Traurig, advising companies on securing data and responding to breaches. Through his own consulting firm, Giuliani Partners, the former New York mayor has worked for cyber-related clients including identity theft protection company LifeLock and insurance giant Aon.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nGiuliani said he will not resign from those roles, even as he becomes a special adviser to the president-elect on these issues. His task, as he described it Thursday, will be to travel the world to find leading experts and introduce them and their ideas to Trump — setting up a clear path for Giuliani to promote his own clients or for companies to hire Giuliani to gain access to Trump.\n\nIn an interview with POLITICO, the former New York City mayor downplayed any concerns about conflicts of interest and said he was drawn to the role because the federal government was far behind the private sector companies like Uber on security.\n\n“I don't know if we can find a cure, but it’s like cancer: We need the private sector to help. We need the best and the brightest,” he said. “I'm very passionate about this work. My firm does a great deal of cybersecurity. I travel all over the world for cybersecurity.”\n\nGiuliani denied he would be selling access to Trump and said he was unsure how much time he would spend working for Trump, but that he would “stay in the private sector.”\n\nHe said it is unnecessary to have policies to separate his private interests and his government advice because he wouldn’t be lobbying and would never take something to the president-elect on behalf of a client. “I don’t see any way in which this is a conflict,” he said.\n\n“People hire me for all different reasons,” he said in the interview. “I would never use my access — I'm not a lobbyist. I'm not going to do any lobbying. I just do solutions.”\n\nTrump’s transition team announced on Thursday morning that Giuliani would be “sharing his expertise and insight as a trusted friend” about the cybersecurity solutions that are being developed in the private sector. The cyber advisory group comes after Trump pledged to get tough on cyber intrusions after massive hacks on Democratic targets during the presidential election.\n\nBecause Giuliani is a volunteer, not a government employee, he won’t come under the remit of federal ethics rules that require officials to separate themselves from potential conflicts of interest.\n\nGiuliani in the interview acknowledged he might have business ties with some of the people he connects to Trump, and that he might be discussing government and private issues with some people.\n\nBut he considers that a synergy, not a conflict.\n\n“Probably 95 percent I'll have no connection with — if I happen to have a business connection with them, obviously I'd make them available also if they're business leaders,” he said. “We do cybersecurity for many people. We are doing very well, and this gives me a chance to get a lot of new players into the game and put them before the government so they can help the government.”\n\nGiuliani’s firm advises some foreign governments on physical security, like retraining police forces, but offers cyber services too, he said.\n\n“If they want cybersecurity solutions, we can give it to them,” he said of foreign companies or firms.\n\nThe arrangement resembles that of activist investor Carl Icahn, who will advise Trump on deregulation, which could directly affect stocks he owns. But since he won’t be a government employee, Icahn will bypass the usual ethical disclosures, divestitures and other safeguards.\n\nIn 2013, Giuliani provided strategic advice to LifeLock and appeared in TV commercials for the company, which the Federal Trade Commission previously fined for overpromising its services.\n\nGiuliani partnered with Aon in 2002, helping major companies avoid and address crises. Cybersecurity has increasingly become a focus for Aon.\n\nAlso in 2002, Giuliani Partners advised wireless company Nextel on securing communications for first responders, the firm said on its website.\n\nAnother client was DataWorld Solutions, a manufacturer of cables used for secure communications later known as Defense Technology Systems.",

  "latent_31246": "Ronald Martinez/Getty Images\n\nThe emotional rollercoaster that is Jarrett Jack has seen Golden State Warriors fans erupt with pleasure one second, while proceeding to pull their hair out the next.\n\nIt has been feast or famine so far this postseason with Jack. He is just as likely to hit a big shot for you with time running out as he is to committing the most mind boggling of turnovers. He is the ultimate conundrum.\n\nOn one hand, the Warriors, while talented, are the youngest and most inexperienced of the remaining playoff teams. When on his game, Jack offers the veteran steadying presence sorely needed on this team of youngsters, especially with David Lee presumably (but not assuredly) out of commission.\n\nOn the other, however, too often late in games Jack, the veteran, is the one most responsible for the befuddling labyrinth the fourth quarter becomes. Averaging nearly four turnovers per game, both the near comeback by the Denver Nuggets in Game 6 of Round 1 and the nail-biting triumph of the San Antonio Spurs in Game 1 of Round 2 can, to a degree, be placed on the shoulders of the shaky Jack.\n\nExcessive dribbling, questionable shot-selection, sloppy decision-making and shoddy defense—most notably on Manu Ginobli's game-winning three—have come to define Jack in his last two fourth quarters. For as great as he played in the regular season—averaging nearly 13 points and six assists with only two turnovers per game—he has been equally as bad late in games.\n\nWith Stephen Curry being bottled up late in games, double-teams being thrown at him with increasing regularity, the Warriors desperately need someone to step up and take some of the slack off of him. With David Lee on the shelf, Andrew Bogut not playing a vital offensive role and Harrison Barnes and Klay Thompson still a year or two away from being able to shoulder that type of burden, it all comes back to one guy: Jarrett Jack.\n\nAnd he knows that as well as anyone. According to Tim Kawakami of the San Jose Mercury News, Jack spoke after practice Tuesday and addressed his struggles:\n\n“Hindsight is always 20-20–I had some great looks, I thought, that I normally make that didn’t go down for me.”\n\nGoing forward, Jack understands the mindset his coach and teammates need him to have:\n\n“I know what he expects of me, I know what my teammates expect of me. I’m just going out there with no worries and no second thoughts.”\n\nStephen Curry is just one man. If the Warriors hope to surprise the Spurs, they’ll need Jack to be more Dr. Jekyll and less Mr. Hyde.\n\nMarc Jackson and the rest of his Warrior teammates must hope that the Jarrett Jack that helped guide them to the playoffs can come up big when it matters.\n\nAll stats courtesy of basketball-reference.com\n\nFollow me on twitter at @martintelleria",

She was killed during a German air raid on Christmas Eve in 1944.\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nRenée Bernadette Émilie Lemaire was born on 10 April 1914 in Bastogne to Gustave Lemaire and Bertha Gallée. Her parents owned a hardware store in Bastogne. She had two sisters, Gisèle and Marguerite. Lemaire had been a nurse in Brussels during the war. Renée Lemaire was the fiancée of a Jew arrested in Brussels by the Gestapo earlier in the year.\n\nWorld War II [ edit ]\n\nIn December 1944, Renée Lemaire returned to Bastogne to visit her parents, and was trapped when the Germans launched its Ardennes offensive on December 16, 1944. Along with nurse Augusta Chiwy, she volunteered at an aid station for the American 20th Armored Infantry Battalion on December 21, 1944. In a commendation request from Battalion Surgeon Dr. Jack T. Prior, Lemaire was described as \"cheerfully accepted the Herculean task and worked without adequate rest or food...\", that she \"changed dressings, fed patients unable to feed themselves, gave out medications, bathed and made the patients more comfortable...\", and \"her very presence among those wounded men seem to be an inspiration to those whose morale had declined from prolonged suffering.\"\n\nOn December 24, 1944, around 8:30PM, Germans bombed the building where the aid station was located. According to a column in a Belgian newspaper, the aid station in the basement of the Sarma Store on rue de Neufchateau was demolished. Lemaire managed to evacuate six soldiers from the burning building, and died while she attempted to save a seventh wounded. Dr. Prior recovered her remains, and brought them back to her parents wrapped in a white parachute.\n\nBand of Brothers [ edit ]\n\nIn the Band of Brothers episode \"Bastogne\", a Belgian nurse named Renée (portrayed by Lucie Jeanne) and a Congolese nurse named Anna (portrayed by Rebecca Okot) were shown to work tirelessly with American medics, including Eugene Roe, to help wounded soldiers.

But yes, the man played football.And he was in the U.S. Navy, too. The man was born to mess with people's heads.\n\nIs it wrong that I think he looks hot in his uniform? Probably...\n\nSeriously though, Harvey Milk was born on May 22nd, 1930 in Woodmere, New York. He came from a Jewish family—his grandpa actually started the very first synagogue in the city where they lived. Harvey was a nice kid, teased by the other kids for his stuck-out ears and big feet. Harvey responded by acting like a goofball a lot, basically trying to get people to like him. This pattern would continue for the rest of his life.\n\nLike I mentioned earlier, Harvey joined up with the Navy after graduating from New York State College for Teachers (it's now the State University of New York at Albany). He served aboard a rescue submarine, then a diving instructor, and was then discharged (though probably not for being gay, despite some of his public statements). Harvey realized he was gay in his teens, but kept it a very close secret until he grew older.\n\nAfter exiting the Navy, Harvey kinda floated around for a while. He was trained as a teacher, and also worked in banking. The guy was a nerd as well as an all-American boy (which just makes my head explode. Lovingly, of course).

That was when Harvey went to San Francisco.\n\nI'm not one for idealizing the dead. By the sound of it, Harvey could be an annoying-a*s man to be around at times. He was a spaz. He was loud. He was probably an attention hog. He once thought about marrying a lesbian, beard style, so he could have a cover and just go about his life. He It was, initially, for a man. But Harvey fell in love with the city, and everything it meant for gay men in the 1970s. You think it's a gay city now? It was friggin' Oz back in the day, with gay people moving into every nook and cranny. There's nothing like being around a bunch of people just like you, isn't it? It empowers you. Heck, it helps create you. It's safe to say that Harvey was never the same again after discovering San Francisco. He would go on to defend it as a safe place for gay people, eventually spreading a gospel of equal rights from its hilly streets.I'm not one for idealizing the dead.

He challenged every gay person in America to come out, to show the heteros in their lives that gay people are everywhere, and he didn't even hold to that himself. But Harvey had guts. He said and did things people only imagined were possible. He knew the value of getting people to like you if you wanted to get anything done in the world. And maybe that was Harvey Milk's legacy: Getting everyone to like him. Because he was indeed the \"gay candidate\" in the public's mind. But he spoke about gay rights in a way that everyone could relate to . That's a miracle. That's progress.",
  "latent_32021": "Here’s a simple algorithm that Yoshiaki Tamura and Yasumasa Kanada used to calculate π to 16 million places. It’s based on Gauss’ study of the arithmetic-geometric mean of two numbers. “Instead of using an infinite sum or product, the calculation goes round and round in a loop,” writes David Wells in The Penguin Dictionary of Curious and Interesting Numbers. “It has the amazing property that the number of correct digits approximately doubles with each circuit of the loop.” Start with these values:\n\nThen follow these instructions:\n\nThe last instruction prints the first approximation to π; then you loop up to the top and run through the instructions again.\n\nRunning through the loop just three times gives an approximation to π that’s already correct to 5 decimal places:\n\nLoop 1: 2.9142135\n\nLoop 2: 3.1405797\n\nLoop 3: 3.1415928\n\nAnd running the loop a mere 19 times gives π correct to more than 1 million decimal places.",

Cast your eyes across the shepherds and animals, the infant and the kings. Then try to see the scene this way: not just as a pious set-piece, but as a complete world picture — intimate, miniature and comprehensive.\n\nBecause that’s what the Christmas story really is — an entire worldview in a compact narrative, a depiction of how human beings relate to the universe and to one another. It’s about the vertical link between God and man — the angels, the star, the creator stooping to enter his creation. But it’s also about the horizontal relationships of society, because it locates transcendence in the ordinary, the commonplace, the low.\n\nIt’s easy in our own democratic era to forget how revolutionary the latter idea was. But the biblical narrative, the great critic Erich Auerbach wrote, depicted “something which neither the poets nor the historians of antiquity ever set out to portray: the birth of a spiritual movement in the depths of the common people, from within the everyday occurrences of contemporary life.”\n\nAnd because that egalitarian idea is so powerful today, one useful — and seasonally appropriate — way to look at our divided culture’s competing worldviews is to see what each one takes from the crèche in Bethlehem.",
  "latent_32717": "Dunwoody Assistant City Attorney Lenny Felgin has resigned amid allegations he made derogatory comments about women and Muslims on Facebook.\n\nThe city of Dunwoody released a statement on Feb. 1 stating Felgin has resigned from his Marietta-based law firm, Riley McLendon, which is contracted to provide legal services to the city.\n\nBy resigning from the firm, Felgin also resigned from his position with the city, according to the statement.\n\n“The city and the firm will work together to fill the role of assistant attorney,” the statement reads.\n\nFelgin could not be immediately reached for comment. His photo has been removed from the city’s website.\n\nThe resignation comes one day after Felgin was put on paid administrative leave by his law firm pending “internal investigations.”\n\nIt is not known the Dunwoody Police Department will continue its investigation into allegations of identity fraud after Felgin claimed his Facebook account was hacked, said Bob Mullen, city spokesperson. Mullen said he is not sure of the status of the city’s own investigation into the allegations, which was being conducted by City Manager Eric Linton.\n\nThe social media posts allegedly made by Felgin began circulating on Facebook Jan. 30. The posts were allegedly made Jan. 28 on the “PBS NewsHour” Facebook page under a story about Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau saying his country will accept refugees. Trudeau’s response followed President Donald Trump’s executive order imposing is a 90-day ban on travel to the U.S. by citizens of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia or Yemen and a 120-day suspension of the U.S. refugee program.\n\nReporter Newspapers could not find the alleged posts in a search of the “PBS Newshour” Facebook page.\n\nOn the night of Jan. 30, the city said in a statement it had contacted “senior representatives of the contracted service provider who stated the allegation is unfounded and the employee was not responsible for the post’s content.” But the next day, it announced Felgin’s leave and further investigation.\n\nPressure has been mounting from many Dunwoody residents for the city to investigate the matter and take some kind of action against Felgin, according to numerous posts to Facebook.\n\nThe entire statement from the city: “The City of Dunwoody was informed by the law firm providing legal advice and services for the city, that assistant city attorney Lenny Felgin has resigned from his position at the firm and subsequently from his position City of Dunwoody. The city and the firm will work together to fill the role of assistant city attorney.”"
